0,"My dad had a heart attack and spent over 7 minutes without oxygen. He was paddle shocked 5 times and now jokes ""when I die...again..."". He says there was absolutely nothing. No ""white light"", no ""seeing your whole life before your eyes"". Nothing. He said it wasn't even scary since there just wasn't anything. The most jarring thing for him was that he woke up from his medically induced coma earlier than they expected and they didn't have anyone available to pull out his breathing tube, so he was awake for a good 10 hours before they could remove it. He was looking at us very oddly, but couldn't verbalize what the deal was. Apparently all his colors were jumbled and my very white mom looked almost eggplant purple to him. His black nurse wasn't a normal person color at all. When he was finally able to talk he asked my mom why she was purple. Then he asked the nurse if she was black, but he fought with finding words that weren't offensive until he stopped caring about trying and just blurted out ""are you black?!"""
1,"I had dangerous open heart surgery due to multiple congenital heart defects at 4 years old. 

I was on ECMO life support where the heart is not beating. I remember before and after the surgery but I have no memory of during the surgery, so no supernatural experience for me. 

It was very traumatic so I may have blocked some of these memories."
2,"In June of 2020, my Dad collapsed in our yard while helping us mow the lawn. He's an older guy, 3-time cancer survivor with dizziness issues but this was a worse fall than we'd ever seen him. He insisted to my Mom that he was fine, and that she didn't need to worry about him. We were both skeptical, but we took his word and kept a close eye on him for the rest of the day.

Fast forward to a cardiology appointment I took him to in October. He was joking with his nurse that he didn't know why he even had a pacemaker put in back in 2015 or so, since it's not like it did anything when she looked him dead in the eyes and said, ""I beg to differ.""

Turns out his collapse was a heart attack, and he flatlined. If it wasn't for the pacemaker in his chest shocking his heart back into rhythm, he would have died right then and there. The good news is they figured out where the blockage was in his heart that caused the problem, and put a stent in. So he's doing alright, all things considered.

He later admitted to my Mom and I that it felt like he was being buried. He kept trying to climb out of the pit he was in, towards a bright light, but he never could get anywhere. And then he woke up. He didn't want to tell us when it happened, because he knew we would bring him to the ER."
3,"after my twin aunts were born, my grandma became severely ill and was clinically dead for a while. she claims to have had an out of body experience and that she went to heaven. apparently, from above she saw herself on the table with doctors trying to save her, and then woke up somewhere she didn’t recognise, but felt overwhelming peace, like she had never felt before, just complete peace and bliss. she then saw a man, and getting closer she saw it was a man whose name i think was harvey, or something along those lines. she grew up in a children’s home as her parents were refugees, and the only joy she had was when this man visited her each month before she aged out and he passed away. in heaven, she approached him and he told her it wasn’t her time yet, she hadn’t done everything she needed to do on earth. so she went back and recovered completely. she’s now my best friend.

i’ve had a couple close calls from suicide attempts but it’s just been pain and darkness."
4,"Not me but my mother is the most severe case I can think of.

Around 25 she started regularly having episodes of severe heart arrhythmias. So bad she fainted and seriously thought she would die (and once almost did because it happened while she was driving). Every doctor she saw told her she was just having panic attacks or was hysterically imagining things and that is wasn\`t as bad as she made it out to be, because by the time she reached the doctor the attack was over and she didn't show any signs of a heart attack in the EKGs. It took more than a dozen cardiologists and over 20 years of visiting doctors for one to finally believe her. She has Wolff-Parkinson-White-Syndrom in combination with a  disorder causing the blood to clot faster and form miniscule clots that reach the heart and trigger an attack but disolve later and can't be detected. She takes blood thinners now and hasn\`t had an attack since."
5,"Went on a road trip with two of my gals, to the middle of nowhere.

I was in the back as we approached a dead roo right in front of us on the road. Friend in passenger seat says 'Stop! I wanna take a picture!' Friend driving does,  the pic was taken by her sticking her hnd out the window, and then friend driving (it was her car), just keeps driving straight over the roo. Doesn't bother going around.

We hear things pop and crunch, and for the rest of the trip a bad smell came from the bottom of the car. 

Those two are so feral. Love em to bits, and we still laugh at this story often."
6,"As a doctor, this thread is causing me chest pain. Some of these things you can actually get very sick from. Or get cancer from. Or die from. "
7,"Do you happen to have high cholesterol? I've noticed this tends to be more common in people who have it. Taking care of the cholesterol won't necessarily do much for the current cyst, but may prevent others. Of course, this is only because I've had relatives who had it diagnosed."
8,"Cholesterol can be crazy. Even when I was a meat eater I had great cholesterol (160s range), and I'm fat. Meanwhile, my thin husband's always had cholesterol in the 200+ range, whether he's eaten meat, not eaten it, etc. He eats OK and gets plenty of movement in.

People have a lot of control of their health, but I think it frightens people to acknowledge just how much they also DON'T control. Family history plays a big role and we like to shy away from that because we want someone or something to blame.

"
9,"It was scary.  I actually had a series of four to five in 24 hours.  I  had never had any previous cardiac issues.  I was only 43 at the time, and I quite suddenly became nauseous and sweaty while showering.  I tried to finish up my shower and couldn’t.  I collapsed into my bed soaking wet and starting experiencing pain under my left breast, wrapping around my side to the back, my left shoulder up the left side of my neck.  I was shaking and my heart rate was high (I was able to have my son grab a pulse oximeter).  My poor teenage boys had to call an ambulance, and they were literally going to send me home from the ER because all the tests were coming back fine.  The only thing that caught it was my troponin levels increased-that’s how they knew heart damage had occurred.  It was labeled NSTEMI.  We never did find the cause-it wasn’t due to a blockage, so the doctors attributed it to an arrhythmia.  They haven’t found the arrhythmia problem to this day, I’m not on any blood thinners, and the cardiac doctors have given me a clean bill of health.  I still get concerned whenever I start getting hot/sweaty/nauseous at all, since I would have never expected those to be associated with having a heart attack, especially in my forties.  I hope this answers your question."
10,"OMD totally scary 

I was on campus when it happened.  Buying breakfast before class, when suddenly I had a hard time breathing.  It was like the air was too warm to breathe.  I collected my breakfast, put it in my bag and quickly took my stuff to the first aid room.  I then collapsed on the floor, took my jacket, scarf, hoodie and hat off, and security called for first aid.  They called the ambulance who thought it was either asthma, acid reflux, anxiety, or an allergic reaction.  We decided to go to the hospital.  They took an EKG and said something isn't right.  Immediately to the trauma bay and this point onwards is a bit of a blur in my memory.  But they transferred me to another hospital.  They took me to the Cath Lab and put a stent in my artery via my wrist.  It was incredibly painful.  There was also something heavy on my chest. The pain from the heart attack combined with whatever heavy item was on my chest, made me feel really nauseous and unwell.  After surgery, I was in the hospital for 6 days.  I couldn't move my wrist for 24 hours, and an IV line was put in my other arm, so I couldn't move that either.  My parents had to help me with meals because of both arms being immovable.  I also hadn't eaten since the night before because my breakfast was still in my bag.  I was the youngest on the ward.  This was 2 months ago.  And I am still learning how to deal with it day by day.  I have 5 new meds to take.  I gotta check my weight everyday, and my blood pressure, and heart rate have to be monitored.  I got a Fitbit to monitor my heart rate since the clinics are closed.  I have since been diagnosed with a condition called SCAD which is the cause of my heart attack."
11,"I had my first one at 18 years old. My entire left side went numb, I became extremely dizzy, disoriented, cold sweats and nauseated. I went to the hospital and was told my troponin levels were elevated and I likely experienced a ""heart related event."" I was never told it was a 'heart attack' but it was more likely a 'transient ischemic attack.' In any case, both of those events are centered around the inability to get oxygen normally to a part of the body (brain/heart/lungs) due to a clot or other vascular issue. I was given no meds, not asked to stay for observation, nothing.

The wildest thing to me is that at that time, it was well-known that I was having issues with my energy/tiredness due to my heart condition. I had surgery as a baby and needed surgery less than a year after this even to close an atrial septal defect in the middle of the atria of my heart that had gotten to be 15 mm wide.

I do not think women are taken as seriously as men when it comes to heart attacks. Men have symptoms that are more ""textbook"" while women definitely do not. But when your heart is fucking up, boy can you tell. Whether you're a man or a woman. I have since learned to advocated for my own health - its easy to do when you have a chronic heart condition from birth."
12,"I think it is important for women to share symptoms because they are often atypical. I never experienced any pain but woke up feeling incredibly dizzy with an extremely cold feeling inside my chest. Lots of heart issues in my family so I called for an ambulance at 6:30 a.m. By 10:00 I was in open heart surgery for a quadruple bypass. Apparently I had a heart attack on the table but because they had already started I survived. Had I been at home at the time I probably would not have made it to the hospital. I now eat a plant based diet, exercise regularly and feel great two years post surgery."
13,"I don't know. I didn't realize that I had one until having tests done afterwards that showed there was damage from it. I did not have the traditional symptoms and did not recognize it as a heart attack while it was occurring. I've always had a couple of heart conditions, so I'm used to feeling the effects from those, but it must not have presented that way at the time."
14,"I was 32, a Kindergarten teacher. It was 1995. I’d been taking a triptan drug for migraine headaches for a couple of years. This one particular occasion, a few hours after I took the tablet, I began to feel terrible pressure in my chest and up into the left side of my jaw. I honestly thought it was indigestion at first and chewed some antacid tablets. The pressure and feeling of panic grew. I called my parents. They got me and drove me to the local ER. 

It was set up with a “triage” nurse at a desk where you came in. The nurse wrote down your symptoms and sent your name to the back. You were told to go to the waiting area and wait until a nurse came out and called your name. 

So, I went to the desk and said I was having chest pains and was starting to feel nauseated. The nurse looked at me and said, “Well, you’re not having a heart attack. Go sit over there and wait for someone to call you.” We sat down. I remember that I started sweating and I was moaning as the pain in my chest intensified. It was very crowded, children crying, noise, smells...we’d been waiting over an hour when I found myself suddenly on my hands and knees puking on some random guy’s foot. 

Just at that moment one of the ER nurses came out from the treatment area to call the next patient and saw me. Turns out she was the mother of one of my students. She rushed me to the back, heard the words “chest pain” and had the doctor, an IV, nitro, EKG all inside 15 minutes. 

I was in the ICU for 2 days, had a cardiac cath, and stress test. It was determined that I had no blockage or other cardiac disease. However, the triptan migraine drug had caused me to have spasms in my coronary artery. They were severe enough to cause a myocardial infarction that left me with moderate heart damage."
15,"Not me, but my mother. A few weeks ago, my mother decided to go out and hang out with her friend. That night, I was surprised that I didn't get a goodnight text or any of the sort as she would always either call me or text me. I thought nothing of it as she probably fell asleep. The next morning, I noticed how my mother wasn't home. Once again, I thought nothing of it and that she probably wanted to spend more time with her friend. 

The next day, I was starting to get worried until she called me. She said that she was in the hospital, and that she ended up getting a heart attack. I gave my step father the phone as she wanted to talk to him, and he didn't even believe her. He truly didn't believe that my mother was in the hospital and just passed it off as ""trying to start an argument."" It took nearly an hour for him to realize that my mother was serious as he could hear one of the machines through the phone. I had to stay away from my step father that weekend as I would have cursed him out for that. 

Two days later, we picked my mother up from the hospital, and we learned that she was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. During the time at home, she always said how her shoulder hurts, and I had to massage it time to time. She also had many dark bruises on her arms. A few weeks later she is doing fine. Her shoulder still hurts but it's getting better. I'm just happy that she's here with me.

Edit: Fixed some typos"
16,"My mum had a heart attack at 51.  She had struggled with heart burn for years anyway, so when she had those feelings she wasn’t too concerned.  She woke up in the night and was vomiting and my dad went to help her.  He said that she went all floppy and clammy and very pale.  My dad was in the army for 24 years and he’s had some medical training so he guessed she was having a heart attack and called 999 immediately.  My mum didn’t even want him to call the ambulance because she didn’t think it could be that serious. 

When they arrived they did tests and said that she had had a heart attack.  She was denying it even to the paramedics! I don’t know the exact details of it but she had a blockage and they removed it by going through her vein and into her artery (again, I don’t know the exact details).  She had smoked since she was 15 so she quit straight away and cleaned up her diet, as well as going on several medications.  4 years later and she’s fine! She was also diagnosed as pre-diabetic but she’s managed to control that.

I wasn’t actually there for any of this because this took place during my first year at uni.  But yeah, even my mum, in the midst of a heart attack, was denying that she was having a heart attack.  Medical advice is so clearly aimed at men, and it could have cost my mum her life if my dad hadn’t been there and acted on his instinct and knowledge."
17,"As someone with PTSD related to ""feeling heart attacks"", I don't think I'll ever know the difference between them and my panic attacks."
18,"My mother died from a “widow maker” heart attack. The left anterior descending artery was 90% occluded when they did the autopsy. She had been complaining of issues off and on but kept writing them off as something else. The morning she died and the night before she had complained of nausea. The ER doctor told us she most likely was having a heart attack for hours and didn’t realize it. I was not with her when she died. 

Now whenever I feel suddenly nauseous I panic."
19,"suffered a heart attack one week after i gave birth. had a sudden coronary artery dissection (SCAD) due to pregnancy. i had no clue pregnancy increases the risk of a heart attack! i was in ICU for a week, had a cardiac catheterization, and they found the torn artery. i was 28 with normal weight, no drinking and smoking, and no medical history. was put on coumadin (blood thinner) for a month. the worst part was pumping my breast milk and throwing them out. after a month of normal healing, they decided that i was pretty much back to normal (95%). now 13 years later, life is fairly uneventful. i just couldn’t do major exercises (heart rate no higher than 130). i was supposed to see a cardiologist every year but life happened. until three years ago, i was diagnosed with breast cancer. now i see a cardiologist every year. once i’m off tamoxifen (for the cancer), i’ll resume daily baby aspirin"
20,"Mom had sort of the same thing. We took her to the ER and they said she didn’t have any signs, but because it’s a rural hospital they sent her to the city. They said her triponin (sp?) started out really low, but kept increasing.

The first cardiologist said they “might” have to put 1 maybe 2 stents in, but once they started doing the procedure realized she needed quadruple bypass surgery."
21,"Dang, the beginning of this sounded like my hot flashes with perimenopause... until you mentioned the pain. 

I have a 30% blockage in the left main artery (widowmaker). Before they found out how mild it actually was, I was 2 DAYS from a double bypass surgery.  I was freaking terrified at 48 years old. Dx with PTSD not long after that hospital stay.  I take my cholesterol medication & calcium blockers religiously now. I try to eat better & take my supplements. Exercise with my other health issues is difficult, but I love to walk."
22,"How high was your heart rate? I'm always worried I'll ignore signs of a heart attack because I have hEDS and POTS, which causes regular pain in my chest, ribs, shoulders, arms, neck and back along with a very high heart rate most of the time."
23,"This is so frustrating. It’s been very well known in science now that heart attacks in women are fairly different than in men. And a lot of doctors still are not paying enough attention on this matter.

I’m sorry to hear you didn’t get that treatment you deserve! I hope you are in better health now! Please in doubt go to a doctor! You know what you feel!!"
24,"My story is very similar but I had a stroke at 27.   Luckily my cardiologist was European and took it more seriously than the American doctors (I’m in the US).  We will just say the heart defect was more widely recognized and understood in Europe and covered by insurance where in the US it’s a battle to get it done.   After lots of heart issues they closed the hole in my heart as well.  My cardiologist told the people who deal with insurance that I was likely to have additional more severe strokes, so it was a “cheaper” preventative measure.  My energy level, stress, migraines, everything improved so drastically.  Seriously a whole new life."
25,"It's sort of infuriating that the signs of both a heart attack and an anxiety attack are largely the same for women, and we don't always know if it's the former until it's dangerously past when we should be getting help. I'm so happy you survived!"
26,"I read heart attacks in women tend to have different symptoms than men's, so the publicized symptoms don't often match Women's heart attacks. What was your experience?"
27,"The same thing happened to me-- they found heart damage on an EKG while doing a routine pre-surgery check. I was only 29 so it was pretty odd...

Stress tests showed nothing of note. Heart is perfectly functional otherwise so we went ahead with surgery. I can't recall any time where I experienced any cardiac symptoms (including the ""atypical"" ones women get) so I really do wonder. The cardiologist suggested it might be also be congenital damage or a weird placement thing. I don't have any trouble with exercise or any day to day things so the doctors told me not to worry."
28,Wow! It's really great your doctor figured it out. I have POTS and EDS too and this is my worst fear--how will I tell my normal symptoms from a heart attack?
29,"Omg. ""Well, you're not having a heart attack"" YIKES. I hope that nurse rethought **that** one after what happened."
30,Which triptan??? I know this was 1995 but I’m so concerned. I have migraines and my mother died of a heart attack in 2014 at 67.
31,"Hi there! At 16, unless you have a pretty serious congenital heart issue, it’s almost unheard of to have a heart attack. It takes time for arteriosclerosis to build up in your blood vessels and cause a blockage, and it’s very unlikely to happen by the time you’re 16. It’s possible that you have another cardiac issue, such as an arrhythmia, but what is much more likely is anxiety attacks. They’re extremely common and can mimic a lot of the symptoms of a heart attack (ie. difficulty breathing, chest pain, shaking, sweating, nausea, headache, etc.). I suspect that’s probably why your doctor said ‘it’s nothing’ in response to your symptoms. They can feel like you’re dying but have no lasting effects, so it’s hard for medical professionals to detect them once they’re over."
32,"Thank you so much, a definite bump on my life journey I was not expecting at my age for sure, but appreciating listening to baby birds outside my window at 7am now 💜. Always a positive in the negatives if you look. I think its the whole numb left arm etc, seemingly a lot of women dont get that, and it's the symptom most people ""look"" for in association with a heart attack. So we do tend to ""brush off"" major signs and symptoms until it's at crisis point unfortunately."
33,"I'm not a doctor, in any shape or form but I'd think, purely from my experience, you would know if you had a heart attack. I get anxiety pretty bad and have done for years but there was literally a period of probably not even 2 hours between what I thought could've been really bad anxiety and realising that something was seriously wrong, and I now have a metal stent in my heart keeping one of my very much needed valves open, which I'm told stopped the pain and feelings I had. Not a ""feeling"" I ever want to experience again, but very quickly becomes obvious it's not just anxiety/attack and didnt go away at all for me, so I wouldn't worry too much but most definitely speak to your doctor and explain your worries, and a simple test should hopefully be able to put your mind at ease. I'm hoping I'm helping more than hindering here"
34,"That's correct, and one reason why women are more likely to not survive. Research on heart attacks was conducted on men, and it's only recently that these differences are being discussed. 

This situation extends to many, many other areas of life, from medication dosage recommendations, to seatbelt placement."
35,"It really varies person to person. I've seen both classic (Crushing chest pain with and without radiation to other parts of the body) and non classic (Dizzy, Nausea/ Vomiting, Flu like symptoms) from both genders. I think because a heart attack can have such vague symptoms is why almost all ER patients now get an EKG and at least 1 troponin level done. 

Not so fun fact: uncontrolled diabetes can damage nerves enough that your body doesn't receive the ""Chest pain announcement"" and is one of the many reasons practitioners push so hard to keep diabetes under control."
36,To be fair she was also 14. It’s not common at all for teens to get heart attacks which is likely why they said it was probably nothing
37,"This reminds me of the Grey's Anatomy episode when Dr. Bailey had a heart attack. 

As women we have to know that symptoms for a heart attack are different than for men.

https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-disease/art-20046167"
38,"This comment has scared me. A few months ago before christmas I woke up in the middle of the night suddenly feeling very sick, I ran to the bathroom, my temp suddenly spiked, I went dizzy and passed out on the bathroom floor. When I woke up, I felt tired but better, not sick anymore just had a bit of a headache that didn't pass for a couple of days, I never went to the doctors because i put it down to being a migraine as I do get them but never like that. There is a history of heart trouble in my family, my dad passed from it before his 40th birthday and I am 36 now. Obviously doctors have other things on their plate to deal with now so I won't be going until it happens again but at least I know the signs now."
39,"I don’t know- I took a shower before and the whole time I was thinking is this a heart attack or am I just worrying? Lmao.

SUCKS"
40,"The first doctor was female, and wasn't really interested in what I had to say. I'm in the UK so I use the NHS, and from personal experience I'd say the system as a whole isn't really interested. I do have a male doctor now who's a lot more friendly than the previous one, so funnily enough I actually think he'd pay more attention to me.

I realise where you're coming from and I do appreciate the concern, but at the same time I'm not dead yet and I suspect that if they were actual heart attacks I'd be dead by now. They're certainly worrying, but a) I can't really get to the doctors because of the pandemic and b) I don't want to find out I have a heart condition in case it precludes me from entering my career of choice."
41,"Hey, I'm in the UK, I'm about ten years older than you but I have some experience with similar issues.

If you're worried that you're in an emergency situation with your symptoms, please do call an ambulance or get someone to take you to A&E. They will look after you. About three years ago I started getting horrible chest pains, sweating, dizziness. I was young and healthy and there were no risk factors. But I went to A&E because it was bloody terrifying. They couldn't find anything wrong, but said its good that I came because it's better safe than sorry with chest pain. This happened twice more, and I got diagnosed with costochondritis - but the important thing is, each time I was reassured that I did the right thing by going to the hospital. Yes, they don't like people wasting time, but by that they mean ""don't come in for a papercut"" - things you are genuinely worried about are 100% OK to go in with."
42,"I know many have commented about anxiety but I had a very similar thing happen when I was 16 and there were multiple times I was 100% convinced I was having a heart attack. Idk how many times my mom rushed me to the ER and the countless appointments we went to for everything to come back normal. Turns out it was anxiety, and I had no idea because I didn’t “feel” anxious at the time. 
Not saying what you’ve got going on IS anxiety, but just keep an open mind because even if you’re not feeling anxious or don’t think anything anxiety-inducing has happened, anxiety attacks can still get ya! 

Also, I was diagnosed with some sort of somatic personality disorder (I forget the name, just remember it had somatic in it, bc that was literally 15 years ago and after therapy I managed to “fix” it for the most part, although on rare occasions I’ll catch myself doing it) - when I get super emotional (whether it’s anger/sadness/fear) instead of “feeling” that emotion like most people do, I manifest it into physical symptoms. A lot of times I wouldn’t realize I was angry/upset/whatever, I’d just get the physical symptom and be like wtf is wrong with my body. 

It’s not unheard of to be young and have a heart condition, my brother had lots of chest pain/heart attack feelings and found out that while he does, in fact, have anxiety, he also has a valve issue that causes some of the chest pain. Just keep an open mind though, like I said, anxiety/other issues can still be a problem even if you don’t feel anxious/whatever emotion when it’s happening!"
43,"Thanks, I notice I've been down voted a few times for saying I don't think it's anxiety but I really do appreciate all the input I'm getting. It's possible it's anxiety, as I've said I really don't know a lot about it so I'll have to do some research.

Yeah, I have a friend who had to have open heart surgery when he was about 12/13 for a valve issue that meant he fainted whenever he got too excited. I don't think it's necessarily something like that, but where I don't know a lot about anxiety I know even less about heart conditions. Considering I've been having this on and off for 2 years now, I don't know why I've never really looked into potential causes. At the end of the day, I think it's down to my somewhat cavalier approach to my health. If I'm not dying, it's not a problem, and if I am dying well it'll happen sooner or later so it's still not a massive problem in my eyes. Maybe a cynical approach, potentially even a worrying one if I'm honest, but I've never been too bothered about the idea of my own death."
44,"I had a heart attack at 28 caused by coronary artery spasm (prinzmetal’s angina). 
I had been feeling pretty bad on and off for 2 days, short of breath, felt exhausted, ‘tired’ feeling in my upper chest and left arm/shoulder. Like the muscle fatigue you feel if you’ve been using your arms above your head for too long. And lots palpitations. I was fine one minute and felt like I had been running a marathon the next, over and over.
Went to the GP twice those 2 days, but I was diagnosed with an anxiety attack and told I was hyperventilating. The evening of the second day it got worse, I was so very tired and my arm felt heavy, and I started getting nauseous. I was watching a movie with my BF, and at one point I told him I was feeling really bad and was going to bed. I got up from the couch, walked 3 steps and collapsed. He dialed the emergency services (I did wake up pretty soon and was able to walk back to the couch before they arrived), and when they arrived and hooked me up to a monitor I was told I was having a heart attack. 

I had no significant pain, more like a dull ache and tiredness, like muscle fatigue, left arm/shoulder and upper chest. The exhaustion was the worst, and I couldn’t walk two steps without getting winded and my heart beating out of my chest. And I knew something was VERY wrong.

I recovered fast and with no lasting damage by the way, and with medication it has not happened again. I was in good physical condition, and still am, and because I seemed fit, healthy and young the GP didn’t think it was something serious."
45,"Not me, but my mom had one at 45. We've talked a lot about it and what if felt like, for her. 

The first time she felt like something was wrong, we were having a huge fight. I said something shitty, and instead of reprimanding or even yelling back she just sat on the couch. She said she felt out of breath, and like her arms had just turned to lead. I wanted to call 911 but she was ADAMANT that she was fine. 

Fast forward a few weeks, she's been exhausted. She's missed so much work because she's ready to nap by 2pm, and needs to go home. She hasn't felt heavy and leaden since that night, but her chest and back felt really tight. After 3 weeks of feeling like this, she finally went to a hospital. Turns out she had a ""serious cardiac event"" and needed a stent put in. She was hospitalized for about a week. 

She said it never felt painful or sharp, and it didn't feel sudden like in movies. One day she was able to run up a flight of stairs and cook dinner, and the next day she needed to nap by 2pm and couldn't handle walking for 10 minutes without a rest. She thought she was either pregnant again or had mono. "
46,"I haven't had a heart attack, but since these stories are being shared I wanted to note the difference between cardiac arrest and a heart attack. My father had a heart attack without going into arrest and somehow this wasn't communicated to my brother or me so we didn't fully grasp what was happening, and I've since heard many people dismiss their symptoms because they don't match a movie scenario.

Below is an abbreviated version from the [American Heart Association](http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks/heart-attack-or-sudden-cardiac-arrest-how-are-they-different), but they have the full signs and symptoms of a heart attack or stroke on their website. As well as info on Hands-Only CPR. Hopefully okay to share here.

""People often use these terms interchangeably, but they are not synonyms. A heart attack is when blood flow to the heart is blocked, and sudden cardiac arrest is when the heart malfunctions and suddenly stops beating unexpectedly. A heart attack is a “circulation” problem and sudden cardiac arrest is an “electrical” problem.
 
Symptoms of a heart attack may be immediate and intense. More often, though, symptoms start slowly and persist for hours, days or weeks before a heart attack. Unlike with sudden cardiac arrest, the heart usually does not stop beating during a heart attack. The heart attack symptoms in women can be different than men.

Sudden cardiac arrest occurs suddenly and often without warning. It is triggered by an electrical malfunction in the heart that causes an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). With its pumping action disrupted, the heart cannot pump blood to the brain, lungs and other organs. Seconds later, a person loses consciousness and has no pulse. Death occurs within minutes if the victim does not receive treatment.""

47,"This question is SO IMPORTANT!!!! I haven’t, but in my life support class we learned it is a fact that heart attacks feel different for women than men. It’s not as widely known as it should be, but women need to know that a heart attack won’t feel/look like the classic signs. "
48,"I have not had a heart attack but I am a nurse who works in a hospital unit that deals with them on a regular basis :)

Just for clarification, as another Redditor pointed out, a ""heart attack"" is a term commonly applied to two different scenarios: a blockage in a coronary artery that causes heart muscle damage (myocardial infarction) OR when the heart isn't pumping blood properly and essentially stops (cardiac arrest), causing a person to essentially die unless someone helps (I.e. CPR +/- defibrillation). However, the two aren't necessarily exclusive - a myocardial infarction *can* cause a cardiac arrest if left untreated (though cardiac arrests aren't always caused by myocardial infarctions, and there are different types of cardiac arrests.....yeah, it's complicated lol).

So for this post, I'm going to assume ""heart attack"" to mean myocardial infarction, which is more common but harder to diagnose (because let's be real, if you go into cardiac arrest, you die, and that's not hard to miss).

The classic symptoms of a myocardial infarction are:

* Chest pain or pressure (often described as squeezing, like a band over the chest, or ""like an elephant sitting on the chest"")
* Pain radiating to the left arm and/or jaw
* Shortness of breath
* Nausea +/- vomiting
* Sweating
* Just generally feeling that something is very wrong

However, I've also seen lots of people say they had vague symptoms.

Most common of the subtle symptoms is the feeling of indigestion or heartburn. I can't count the amount of times I've heard the story of ""ate a big meal, went to bed, woke up with indigestion, took an antacid, and still felt like shit, continued to take antacids, and when I felt really unwell, went to the hospital."" The general rule of thumb I like to stick to is, if you're having heartburn and it won't go away with heartburn treatment, see a doctor. Even if it's ""just"" heartburn, you'll want to get it treated, anyway, because if left uncontrolled, it can damage your esophagus.

Other vague symptoms would be things like back pain, arm pain, nausea, intense fatigue, and dizziness. In fact, a couple of times, I've had patients who had no symptoms at all until we ran some tests on them; this is most common in people with diabetes.

While women are more likely to have the non-traditional signs and symptoms, men can have them, too, just like women can also have the classic signs. In fact, my first patient with a silent heart attack (no signs or symptoms) was a man!

So yeah, it's not very cut and dry but if you are ever concerned, please just call 911 (or whatever number you call for an ambulance) and get yourself to a hospital. Even if it turns out to be nothing, don't feel embarrassed or feel like you've wasted our time. We always take potential cardiac symptoms seriously because it's hard for us to tell, too, based on signs and symptoms alone, and the tests are fairly easy and quick. And  like a lot of other major ailments, it's best to get treated early rather than let it go on and on, potentially causing major damage.

Lastly, because I always get messaged, *please* no one ask me medical questions about you or a specific person. I cannot make assessments and give advice over the internet. If you have concerns about yourself or a loved one, please see a doctor in person."
49,"My mom had one last year and said it wasn't what men are known to experience at all. She had gone to bed and felt uneasy, said her heart started to ""smash and bang"" and generally felt anxious and unwell. She said she just knew something was wrong and suspected a heart attack, as they run in the family (she was the fourth of her siblings to have one within a three-year span) and my grandmother had died of one when I was a baby. My dad drove her to the hospital and it was confirmed she had a ""mild, non-stemi"" heart attack. Heart disease seems to be hitting the family younger and younger so my brother and I are probably at risk of developing it too. 

&#x200B;

For the record, my mom has never smoked, quit drinking and had good cholesterol. "
50,"“HNGGHHHH” - me, during my heart attack"
51,"Which part exactly is false? My point was that [women are more likely to experience non-traditional/not-so-obvious signs and symptoms](http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/warning-signs-of-a-heart-attack/heart-attack-symptoms-in-women), but men can, too. The signs and symptoms are really variable across the board.

Quoted directly from the linked page from the American Heart Association:

>“Although men and women can experience chest pressure that feels like an elephant sitting across the chest, women can experience a heart attack without chest pressure, ” said Nieca Goldberg, M.D., medical director for the Joan H. Tisch Center for Women's Health at NYU’s Langone Medical Center and an American Heart Association volunteer. “Instead they may experience shortness of breath, pressure or pain in the lower chest or upper abdomen, dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting, upper back pressure or extreme fatigue.”

Or from the [Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.ca/heart/conditions/heart-attack):

>Women generally recognize the “Hollywood heart attack” with chest-clutching, crushing pain. If their pain is less severe, or if they have non-pain signs such as nausea, sudden fatigue or shortness of breath (signs more often reported by women), they are more likely to delay getting to emergency care, and once there, they are less likely to get fast, aggressive treatment."
52,"Not me, but I'm a nurse who works frequently with heart attack patients (for simplicity, I'm calling them heart attacks, when I mean ""myocardial infarctions"" - a blockage in one or more coronary arteries, causing heart muscle damage due to a lack of oxygen supplied by blood). The symptoms range from the very typical to really odd ones. I'd say the most common symptoms are pretty typical - a lot of chest pain (usually described as a ""heaviness"" like an elephant on the chest or a ""crushing"" or ""squeezing"", but people can have all sorts of different pains), often accompanied with symptoms like shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, and/or just generally feeling unwell and that something ""just isn't right"". Sometimes, the pain radiates to the jaw, the left arm, and/or the back, but I actually find it's less common than simply chest pain.

The most common vague symptom is definitely heartburn. Heartburn can mimic heart attacks and vice versa. I've seen people who thought they were having heartburn for days on end, when actually, they were having a heart attack (because it's not like on TV, where people suddenly clutch at their chests and keel over; such cases are usually the people who go into arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, which *can* be caused by heart attacks but not always). Usually, the key difference is the presence of other symptoms described above, but as I said, they're not always present. This is one of the reasons why it's important to get heartburn checked out if it doesn't respond to over-the-counter medications (the other side to it is that heartburn can actually do damage to your esophagus over time, so it's best to nip that in the bud in its early stages).

Lastly, I hope I don't scare anyone here, but there is also such a thing as ""silent heart attacks"", where a person is having a heart attack but there aren't any symptoms. It's more common in those with diabetes and the elderly. I once had a patient who was in hospital for a gangrenous toe (don't get diabetes, folks), and one morning, he was awake early and reading the newspaper, so I did a set of vital signs on him. To my surprise, his pulse was in the 140's (for reference, normal rate is 60-100, though we start to get worried around the 110-120 range). Called the doctor, who ordered some tests. The patient was totally calm, no pain or breathing difficulties (except for his sore toe). Turns out he was having a heart attack! He was treated for it and did fine, but sometimes I wonder what would have happened if he were sitting at home rather than in the hospital.

(**EDIT:** I am getting a few questions about the heart rate thing. I should add that heart rate alone is *not* an indicator of anything. It has to be taken in context. *Lots* of things can cause a high heart rate, from benign causes like anxiety or too much caffeine to more concerning things like a serious heart condition. One must take into consideration things like other vital signs, signs and symptoms, the patient's history, etc., to get even a decent clinical picture of what's going on. If a high heart rate can be explained, then it's not as big of a deal, either. For example, if a person is in respiratory distress, then they will have a heart rate because, well, they're struggling to breathe. As soon as you fix the respiratory issues, the heart rate should come down nicely. Also, the 110-120 range is still referring to a *resting* heart rate, and don't forget that I work in a hospital, often with patients who have co-morbidities that affect the heart's health and/or are elderly, who typically have lots of co-morbidities anyway. A young, healthy person may be able to tolerate a resting heart rate in the 110-120 range if, say, they get sick. An elderly person who has diabetes and heart disease? Yeah, not so much. A person who has just had a heart attack? Same. Their hearts just aren't able to work as hard as a young, healthy person's for prolonged periods of time. If you're young, healthy, and not sick or anxious or anything like that and your *resting* heart rate is elevated, then I wouldn't say it's a cause to panic, but you may want to get checked out by your family doctor - could be anything from anxiety to a malfunctioning thyroid to an actual problem with your heart. Again, go with your gut. If something feels *wrong* to you and you're that concerned about it, then talk to a doctor. I can't diagnose anything over the Internet...plus, I'm a nurse so I don't diagnose things in general!)

On the flip side, you can also have all the symptoms of a heart attack and even had things like electrocardiogram changes that suggest a heart attack, but in actuality, your coronary arteries don't have any blockages! (i.e. not a heart attack) An example would be [Takotsubo cardiomyopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takotsubo_cardiomyopathy) (a.k.a. Broken Heart Syndrome). I've looked after two patients with this diagnosis and it's really bizarre. Basically, the heart muscle will be injured, often due to stress (hence the name Broken Heart Syndrome - it's been known to happen after a person has lost a loved one), so we'll often see changes in the ECG, troponin level rise in the blood (often used to determine severity of a heart attack), and even indicators of heart failure. However, when an angiogram is done, there aren't any coronary artery blockages. The good news is that people generally do well after this, so long as they take care of themselves.

So basically, the heart is a very complicated organ and there is no real way to tell if there's something seriously wrong with it or not based on symptoms alone. As well, pain in the chest can be caused by so many different things, from anxiety to costocondritis to pulmonary emboli to heart attacks. Basically, if you have a concern about it, go see a doctor. Go with your gut and don't ignore symptoms that won't go away.

**LAST EDIT:** I'm getting lots of people asking me about their specific situations. As per Reddit policy (and because it's uncomfortable for me), I won't be giving medical advice to *anyone*. I can't evaluate anyone over the Internet. I'd merely be taking wild guesses, which isn't safe. If you have an actual concern about your health, please see a professional in real life, who can discuss things with you and do an examination."
53,"EMT here. I once treated a woman who was exhibiting all the classic signs of an anxiety attack, but we decided to do an EKG just in case because she was also feeling gassy. I'm glad we didn't just write her off as she requested because she was in a full-blown STEMI! Another time a family friend called me because she was just feeling a sense of doom and heaviness, like an elephant was sitting on her. I told her to call an ambulance just in case, and sure enough, it was a heart attack. 

Big ones to watch out for are difficulty breathing, feeling ""tight"" in the chest, weakness in both arms, or just feeling like something is really, really off. I always say air on the side of caution."
54,"This is an awesome question! Women have definitely been seen to have much different symptoms from men and it's so important to know about how cardiac episodes can present themselves for women vs. men.  Heart disease might not be the most popular or talked about cause, but heart disease and strokes are the cause of death of one out of every three women. 

I've been involved with the American Heart Association for years and they have a TON of resources but below are some pointers. Overall, all the survivors I've heard speak over the years typically say they experienced headaches and ""heaviness,"" but not the traditional arm tingling and crushing chest pain. It was much more subtle. 

Lastly, one of the big things we always try to hit home is it is so often that women are the last to raise their hand and recognize something is really wrong with them. We put others in front of us and think that it will just pass. One women told me she went the whole day, getting her sons to school, cooking dinner for her family, while she was suffering from a severe cardiac episode. She just didn't think it was serious enough to bother anyone with until she collapsed. 

**Signs of a Heart Attack**

- Uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain in the center of your chest. It lasts more than a few minutes, or goes away and comes back.

- Pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach.

- Shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort.

- Other signs such as breaking out in cold sweat, nausea or lightheadedness.

- Women are somewhat more likely than men to experience some of the other common symptoms, particular shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting and back or jaw pain.

**Signs of Stroke and TIAs (transient ischemic attack)**

- Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body.

- Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding.

- Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes.

- Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination.- Sudden severe headache with no known cause."
55,"My mum has had heart problems since birth. She said that with her first major heart attack she remembers working in the store then the next second she was in hospital. No real symptoms right before or anything, her boss just saw her collapse which is really frightening. Thankfully, I didn't inherit anything like that. 

Edit: also remember watching wwe once and one of the commentators had a heart attack on air.  Listened to a podcast with him and he said the same thing,  next to no symptoms apart from slight shortness of breath. "
56,"I had a heart attack due to an artery dissection a week I gave birth (no health/heart issues, no family history) at the age of 29. apparently the changes during pregnancy  increases the risk of heart attack, which I had no clue and wasn't even aware to look out for symptoms. during my first few days home after the c-section, I felt numbness on my left arm and left leg. it felt like they were asleep so I would shake them. I thought my arm was sore from carrying an 8 lb baby. the day of the baby's one week check up, I woke with cold sweat. i could breathe, but it felt like someone was sitting on my chest. went to the 9 am doc for the baby's appointment, and my husband told the receptionist that I was having chest pain. they rushed me to see a doctor right away and gave me aspirin. I felt better right away and off to the ER. I tell people to look for numbness on the left side, and chest pain during and post pregnancy. occasionally I freak out over heartburn because it felt like it, but my heart is about 99% healed :)"
57,I had a patient whose angina symptoms were jaw and teeth pain. She had originally gone to the dentist to investigate her symptoms - luckily the dentist was insightful and got her to a cardiologist. We found extremely lesioned arteries in the Cath lab; she was a walking time bomb for a heart attack.
58,"My mother had an heart attack and her only symptom was excruciating ear pain. Kid you not! Was lying on the floor, whimpering in a mix of her mother tongue and German, clutching her ears. Called our 911 equivalent, the dispatcher tried to tell me it was probably just a bad cold, buuuut if I insisted he would send somebody over. Asshole. It's 3 in the night, I wouldn't call if it didn't look really serious. "
59,"OK I am not a woman but I did have a heart attack and the symptoms were very mild.

I was already being treated for angina, high blood pressure and diabetes.

My cardiologist told me ""you know all the classic symptoms, but there are others. So if anything at all unusual starts happening? Get thee to a hospital.""

What was unusual? I was working late shift and so I got up at around 10 AM. Yawned, walked slowly to the front door and picked up the paper. Took it into the kitchen to sit, drink coffee and read the paper. I was out of breath from that tiny amount of exercise. I rested several minutes until my breathing was normal and walked slowly to the front door (16 feet) and back. Arrived out of breath. Called a cab. No drama. Take me  to emerg please. 

Checked in at the reception saying I thought I was having  a heart attack and my cardiologist said I should come here. 

They took me seriously and did some basic monitoring.They would not let me leave until they did 'something about it.'  

I left the hospital after having a quintuple bypass a couple weeks later."
60,"My late father went to his doctor to complain about heartburn.  One test led to another.  Both his carotid and pulmonary arteries were almost completely blocked.  Right at that appointment the doctor got him an appointment for bypass surgery in a week.   I learned in the hospital that he had earlier had a ""silent heart attack"".

A very fit friend of mine in her 30s who ate a vegan diet went to a health fair that had some sort of portable scanner that revealed her carotid artery had a LOT of plaque buildup on it.

Turns out she is one of those people with genetics that despite a great lifestyle, still needed statins.

Bottom line, have regular checkups with a thorough doctor.   You just don't know what could be going on inside of you."
61,"Ex-boyfriend had two heart attacks in his 20's,  physically fit with no family history of heart disease.  He smoked and drank and certainly didn't eat the healthiest, but also played soccer several times a week and was in pretty decent shape.

He had heartburn, chest pain, vomiting, cold sweats, shortness of breath and was very pale.  I honestly thought it was heat stroke, it was very hot that day and he had just played soccer maybe an hour earlier, but I suppose he sensed it was something worse and so I drove him to the ER.   They did the ecg and took him back almost immediately, it was a 100% blockage of his right coronary artery and he had an angioplasty and stent put in.   Huge life change for him that he had a really hard time accepting and adjusting to - sort of caused the second heart attack himself, by not being diligent with his meds and we knew right away to call an ambulance that time."
62,"My mother had throbbing jaw discomfort for months before she experienced full cardiac arrest.  She brought this up with her dentist and GP, but neither could find anything wrong.  About a month and a half before the heart attack, she had an EKG done to make sure she was clear to go on this big trip that she and my dad planned for overseas, and it showed no abnormalities.  She had also lost ~60 lbs over the previous 18 months in preparation for this trip, which involved a whole lot of walking.

The day or two before the heart attack, she experienced higher-than-usual fatigue and some heartburn (I think?), but nothing that was out of the ordinary for her, especially with the  leukemia drugs that she takes.  Then, at about 11:30 on a Tuesday night four years ago, she just dropped clinically dead on the kitchen floor with a full blockage of one of her arteries.

I was able to intervene almost immediately with CPR until the EMTs arrived and (eventually) successfully defibrilated her.  We've been very lucky that she's made a very substantial recovery.  While she has considerably diminished cardiac capacity, she did not suffer any other major organ damage and, while somewhat frail, she's a fully-functioning 55-year-old."
63,"Sorry this is long.

That last bit--Broken Heart Syndrome--I had something similar but no broken heart.  10 years ago, I was in law school, my dad died, and I was becoming hypothyroid (undiagnosed another years).  So *everything* was stressing, and my bp was good if it was under 145/100.  This was for over a year.

Having chest pains, I was sent to a cardiologist.  He asked me to describe my pain; I described six distinct types of pains: weight on chest, like a tight band; pain under the sternum; pain up to my jaw; sharp pains (like nails being pounded in) just left of center on my chest; dull aches that had me grabbing at my chest; and the worst one--lasting pain like someone shoved a pipe through my chest and it was coming out my back.  Oh, and though it's just an indicator of inflammation *somewhere*, a CRP over 20.  I'd had years of heartburn; an endoscopy showed NO esophageal issues.

The cardiologist's mouth literally dropped open on that last bit, husband said it was because that was ""classic heart attack"" and I said I'd felt it 8 or 9 times.  EKG was clear--they've always been just fine since, too.  First stress test was ""inconclusive.""  Two years later, the second one was, too.  I also had a massive x-ray, had to go to San Francisco for that--no *major* problem found, calcification somewhere between 0 and 50%, so not really helpful.  Oh, and an ultrasound, and some other test I can't remember.  All that was found found was that my heart was a bit larger than expected, but not unduly so, and no thickening of the walls.  I was told that I could ""buy green bananas""--I'd be alive to eat them when ripe, if you didn't figure that out.

Finished law school, got thyroid dosage right (that took a couple of years), and with that find, I passed the Bar the second time.  Stress down, as I was not working.  When I had pain suddenly, I insisted on an angiogram, based on that pain, my history, and family history (father had blockage but his body had made its own diversions around it).  

I had NO significant blockage of ANY kind.  At age 50, my arteries weren't perfect, but we're about as good as a 25yo.  NO damage to my heart muscle.  CRP still won't come down.  

**tl;dr**:  So not all chest pain means a heart attack, but it pays to be cautious, right?"
64,">Lastly, I hope I don't scare anyone here, but there is also such a thing as ""silent heart attacks"", where a person is having a heart attack but there aren't any symptoms. It's more common in those with diabetes and the elderly. 

I'd also note they are more common in women over 40 then men. I can find a source if desired. "
65,"I'm in my early 30s, heart disease runs in my family. I went to the ER a few weekends ago with chest pains thinking it was severe heartburn. Turns out it was angina(?). The symptoms I had were chest pains like someone was pressing heavily in the center of my chest and slight shortness of breath. They did chest xrays, CT scan  and EKG. Everything came back fine. What did show up to be abnormal were my triponin levels. After being discharged from the hospital the next day, I scheduled a stress test, which came back normal, and then an echocardiogram which also came back normal. The doctor said this was an anomaly, but put me on an Aspirin regimen and I have to get yearly checkups due to my family history. The doctor said I may not exhibit symptoms for days, months or years from now but also to have my blood pressure checked regularly. Moral of the story; Don't ignore chest pains, people."
66,"So once your pulse is around 140 bpm, you should be concerned it's a heart attack?  

My heart rate sometimes spikes for 2-30 minutes and I get lightheaded.  I was referred to a cardiologist for basic tests (a heart monitor), where they confirmed my heart rate spikes, usually to 115-125 bpm.  They sent me back to my GP who shrugged about it and said to come back another time, and go to the ER if it gets worse.

No one will tell me what 'worse' actually means, though.  I have absolutely no idea what warrants a trip to the ER.  Since you mentioned 140bpm, is that around the time I should consider going to the ER?  I know you can't really give me medical advice based off of a random reddit comment, but if I could get some not completely vague guidelines for when I should be concerned, that would be *amazing*.  "
67,"Thank you for this. I lost several important women in my life to heart attacks in their 40's and 50's, and I'd never heard of women having much risk for them prior to that. Being about to turn 40 myself, and with a family history of heart disease, this is good information to be aware of."

69,"Absolutely! No decent doctor worth his/her salt would turn away a patient who was complaining of chest pain. If all tests come back normal, then it's just a relief for all parties involved. So, yeah, it's always worth getting it checked out :) No one will laugh at you or think any less of you."
70,"Heart rate alone isn't really an indicator of anything in particular. Lots of people with heart attacks come in with heart rates within normal range. On the other hand, you can have people having anxiety attacks (scary for the person, of course, but not life threatening) with very high heart rates. So, yeah, heart rate has to be taken within context and in conjunction with many other things, like other vital signs, the patient's presentation, and other signs and symptoms (and, of course, other diagnostic tests if needed, like blood work or ECGs)."
71,"No not necessarily. A high heart rate could be a result of many things. If it's not accompanied by chest pain or any other symptom of a heart attack, I'd think of other possibilities first. Also (almost - 2 months away) a nurse. 
If you have a high heart rate, start to get dizzy, short of breath, feel it pounding in your chest or fluttering, have chest, jaw, back or arm pain - that's when you should go to the ER. 

I personally have inappropriate sinus tachycardia, which basically means my heart rate is around 120 when I'm at rest. It's totally benign for me. "
72,"I should really put a note on that...

110-120 is in context, and I meant that as a *resting* heart rate. Heart rate alone *does not mean anything* and other things - like other vital signs, signs and symptoms, history, etc. - must be taken into consideration to interpret what a heart rate means in a clinical sense.

Your resting heart rate is about 80, which falls within normal range. Remember, I work in a hospital with ill patients, usually an older population (i.e. age 60+), and most patients I see aren't typically the healthiest of people (i.e. typically have at least one co-morbidity, such as smoking, diabetes, COPD, cardiac disease of some sort, etc.). Where I work specifically - cardiology - if the heart has already sustained damage because of, say, a heart attack, then we do try to keep the resting heart rate below 90. Anything higher means the heart must work harder, which is like making an injured person run a race.

If you're young, otherwise healthy, and have no symptoms, it's likely not too worrying. I've had young patients come in for things like infections or uncontrolled blood sugars (type 1 diabetics), and the doctors are fine with them having heart rates in the 120's because they're young and can compensate for that fast a rate (and there's an obvious explanation for it). A person in their 80's who has multiple co-morbidities? Yeah, their bodies just aren't as capable of compensating for as long.

Obviously, I can't diagnose anything over the Internet, but if your heart is beating fast with just ""any movement"" and you have no symptoms but is normal at rest, I'd hazard a guess that you may want to work on your cardio exercises if you aren't already? If you're physically fit, though, then I honestly have no idea and someone would have to actually evaluate you in person."
73,"I'M TOTALLY AWARE, I'M LIKE IRRATIONALLY AFRAID OF HAVING A HEART ATTACK.  Seriously, I think I'm having one at least once a week.  Good thing I live with a nurse who's good at sniffing out bullshit.

I don't know about anything else.  I know that women are *way* more likely to have migraines though.

Anyway, good on you for bringing up this heart attack business- people should know."
74,"I had no idea the symptoms of a heart attack manifest differently in women and my grandmother died of one. For shame.

Many STDs manifest differently in women. We get actual symptoms - discharge, pain, fever, where as males can not know anything is wrong for a long time, because of an almost complete lack of any warning signs."
75,"Yup, a friend's mom died of a heart attack that was interpreted as simple heartburn. I just found out the other day that it can present differently in people with diabetes as well. "
76,"Quick googling:

>Some digestive diseases, including Crohn's disease, affect more women than men. Up to six times more women than men have irritable bowel syndrome, a collection of symptoms that affect the large intestine. Women are likelier to have gallstones, due to the effects of progesterone and estrogen. For various reasons, women are likelier than men to use aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), and so are likelier to experience their harmful side-effects.


>With some exceptions, autoimmune diseases tend to affect one sex more than the other; specifically, far more women than men.

The most popular theory to date has been that female hormones set the stage for diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis. 


>Graves Disease

>Recent studies put the incidence of Graves' disease at one to two cases per 1,000 population per year in England. It occurs much more frequently in women than in men. The disease frequently presents itself during early adolescence or begins gradually in adult women, often after childbirth, and is progressive until treatment. It has a powerful hereditary component.[3] Graves' disease tends to be more severe in men, even though it is rarer. It appears less likely to go into permanent remission and the eye disease tends to be more severe, but men are less likely to have large goitres.[65] In a statistical study of symptoms and signs of 184 thyrotoxic patients (52 men, 132 women), the male patients were somewhat older than the females, and cases were more severe among men than among women. Cardiac symptoms were more common in women, even though the men were older and more often had a severe form of the disease; palpitations and dyspnea were more common and severe in women.[3]

77,"Yes, a family friend had a heart attack and didn't find out what it was until much later. 

I don't really know about other diseases. "
78,"I was aware for heart attacks. 

Not quite the same issues but ovarian cancer in the early stages can easily mimics other minor issues (symptoms: bloating, frequent urination, pressure/pain in the abdomen, changes in bowel habits, unexplained vaginal bleeding).

--------------------------------------------

But to lighten the mood, an anecdote for all my fellow hypochondriacs:

A few years back my mom was under quite a bit of stress. She started having intermittent chest pains and, very concerned, she went to the doctor ... turned out to be heartburn."
79,"Yes, I am aware. I am an EMT and every time we have any cardiac related con-ed we talk about this. 

I know there are disorders women are more or less likely than men to have. As far as the same disease manifesting differently though? All that comes to my sleep deprived mind is autism and ADD/ADHD, all of which tend to manifest differently in males and females. But they aren't really medical emergencies. "
80,"Actually, those symptoms are not really different from those of men. The article you linked had no information about the comparison of heart attack symptoms between men and women."
81,"It's 100% related to anxiety.  Not that I'm having panic attacks that *feel* like heart attacks, just that every time I feel something that is listed as a heart attack symptom I'm like, ""YUP IT MUST BE A HEART ATTACK"""
82,"I've seen a lot of women having heart attacks and they have all displayed the typical ""classic"" heart attack signs and symptoms.  They describe crushing, squeezing, or heavy pain in the center of their chest, often shortness of breath, pain radiation to the jaw or L arm, and they have all had an intense sense of fear/impending doom.  

There is always the possibility of having an atypical presentation though, such as nausea which won't go away, ""not feeling right"", and abnormal weakness/fatigue.  These types of symptoms are more common in the elderly/diabetic community. 

If you have a strong history of heart disease in your family, you can ask your primary care doctor to refer you to a cardiologist so you can get a cardiac stress test (walking/running on a treadmill hooked up to an EKG).  The entire test takes about an hour and can help see if there's any signs that suggest heart disease.  "
83,"Do you see a cardiologist? I think that would be the best person to talk to about what symptoms you should pay attention to and what you can safely ignore.

My dad had a heart attack last summer. He had chest pain, and his dad died of a heart attack, so he went to the hospital. Lucky him, because he was in the hospital with a cardiologist present when he actually had the heart attack. They were able to act very quickly, and that's probably why he didn't suffer any permanent damage. He has recovered fully.

The moral of that story being, consult a professional and do not screw around."
84,"If you're worried about breast cancer or heart attacks then you'll need to keep a watch out for signs and signals. Grab a card from your doctor about how to give yourself a breast exam and hang it in the shower (Just a simple lump test). You can check every day, or once a week. Whatever makes you feel comfortable.

While classic heart attack symptoms do occur, studies directed towards women's health show that they may not be present at all with heart attack in women. It may be helpful to familiarize yourself with both sets of symptoms.

I wouldn't be afraid to talk with specialists in both areas to discuss what your options are for prevention, and what steps you need to take as you get older. My family has numerous breast cancer survivors and two members who suffered from heart attacks. It will definitely ease your mind to know as much as you can. "
85,My sister had a heart attack.  She didn't experience *any* symptoms other than blanching.  Luckily she was in the hospital at the time (visiting) and a nurse asked her if she felt alright and then they started doing the tests or whatever it is you do to diagnose a heart attack. 
86,"What do you do? I did have an EKG and stress test done a few years ago (as well as an ultrasound of my heart). The EKG showed bradycardia. Stress test was fine. The mitral valve is allowing some blood to regurgitate which showed up on the ultrasound but the cardiologist wasn't concerned about it.

I keep reading that women have atypical symptoms so I was curious."
87,"I wish you the best and a complete recovery. And you know, it's never too late--as long as you're living--to take charge of your health. My mom didn't begin exercising and eating better until after her heart attack a couple years ago. Since then, she hired a trainer at a gym and went on a diet. She has dropped a LOT of weight and several sizes--she looks better than I ever remember! And she is 67."
88,"How old was your sister when she had the heart attack? I guess if you're gonna have one, it's better to already be in a hospital. Was she under a lot of stress at the time?"
89,"That is really interesting about the sense of doom! That's not something I've ever seen listed under symptoms..

I have acid reflux and am used to my reflux, but a few years ago I had very unusual chest pain and began having a panic attack when it didn't go away. Went to the ER, they ran some tests to make sure I wasn't dying then sent me home with a dx of heartburn. 

I felt a little silly but better safe than sorry."
90,"It feels fucking wonderful, to be honest.  Straight up, I revel in the fact that men are more likely to have heart attacks.

HEART ATTACKS FOR ALL MEN!"
91,"It just sucks. I am a huge, huge aficionado of sudden death. It is the best way to go, especially before those downhill years kick in. Heart attack is preferable to stroke because it minimises the chances of surviving with brain damage. Again, women are cheated by biology."
92,"~~Where does that info come from? I thought women and men were equally likely, but women were more likely to die from it than men.~~

Or rather:

How does it feel knowing you're much more likely to stay alive after a heart attack than women?"
93,"It feels shitty. Heart disease is still the leading cause of death for women in my country. It's not that we're less likely to have a heart attack, it's that ours are less likely to be recognized as such before it's too late."
94,"It's one of the tradeoffs.  We're more likely to get depression, or more likely to have our heart attacks misdiagnosed.  I don't think about it much."
95,"In my family we have bad hearts and it is actually highly likely that i will die of a heart attack, just like my aunt, grandmother, and 2 of my great-grandmothers.   Since we all have to die, I would rather go out like that than with something shitty like cancer or dementia anyway, so bring on the heart attacks."
96,My Dad died of a heart attack in my Moms arms..
97,"How does it feel knowing that women are more likely to die from heart disease than men, and heart attacks in women typically present differently than they do in men?"

99,"I love these ""How do you feel"" questions.

Because they're never *actually* asking a genuine question we can answer. It's just a really really thinly veiled ""HEY, I'D LIKE TO PASSIVELY AGGRESSIVELY POINT SOMETHING OUT TO YOU."" move."
100,"I've lived with them for decades. I'm not sure there is a ""why""; some people just get them while others don't, like hives or a stutter. 

One of the best bits of advice I ever got came from a therapist who used cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to help me with the attacks: Once they start, you can ease the symptoms, but the chemical cocktail that creates that sensation of panic takes some time to metabolize out of your bloodstream. Just thinking of it as a purely physical phenomenon -- just like sweating during exercise or getting itchy eyes after dusting -- really helped a lot. 

Thinking of them in milder terms has also made a big difference: not ""this is unbearable"" but ""this is unpleasant,"" not ""I can't stand this"" to ""this will end soon and I'll just breathe my way through it until then."" Catastrophizing the attacks, I've found, really ramps them up in intensity. I no longer think of a long-lasting, intense attack as ""the worst"" or ""so bad"" but as...well, long-lasting and intense. Using those less emotionally charged words to describe the episode helps me step back from feeling the panic and more toward observing it, if that makes sense. 

I still get panic attacks, and they aren't ever fun, but they've become far more manageable by seeing them as a physical symptom of a weird little quirk of my brain chemistry. Other things that help: 

- Focusing on my breathing
- Playing some inconsequential word game in my head
- A change of scenery during the attack
- Recalling past attacks and realizing I didn't have a heart attack during any of those episodes either


"
101,"I used to get them several times daily, now only once or twice a month. It very much feels like a heart attack, or just ""impending doom/death"" in general. The best thing for me is acknowledging and accepting the panic attack, trying to fight it just makes it worse. And distraction and deep breaths also. During a panic attack we tend to hyperventilate which in turn worsens symptoms like pounding heart, rapid pulse and shortness of breath. It's a vicious cycle. "
102,"When I started suffering from panic attacks in my early 20s I literally thought I was going to have a heart attack and die. Went to the hospital a few times because I believed I was dying in fact. I read this book and a few like it and found educating myself about the symptoms to be an important first step in realizing I could take back control of my body. Like some have already said, breathing deeply and slowly is helpful to me, knowing that by slowing my breathing mindfully I am also slowing my heart rate naturally. Give it a few minutes of focusing on breathing slowly and nothing else and then check in with yourself to see how you feel. I haven't had a real panic attack in 5+ years and seldom even feel high anxiety. Good luck to you!

"
103,"Having someone talk me through it really helps. I begin to feel like I'm having a heart attack, hyperventilating, and like the world is ending. I do my best to focus on steadying my breathing and call someone up if I'm alone.

If I begin to feel one coming on I'll often leave my house and force myself to go out in public/into the most social situation I can bear. It is the thing that I least want to do in that moment but it really helps. Seeing other people going about their days like nothing is wrong really helps put my panic/anxiety into perspective and is very calming."
104,"* don't try to fight it.  Accept that you are having a panic attack.  Let it pass.  Try thinking, ""I'm having a panic attack.  That's all this is.""  Picture it going through you. 

* breathing technique: put your tongue at the roof of your mouth.  Breathe in for a count of four; hold it for a count of seven, and let it out with a whooshing sound for a count of 8.

* if it becomes a regular thing, consider cognitive behavioral therapy. "
105,"I do - they were so debilitating as a kid that I didn't know how I was going to possibly live with them for the rest of my life.  

Buy this book and work through it.  Once you understand them, you can go about fighting them off better:

http://www.amazon.com/Panic-Attacks-Workbook-Program-Beating/dp/1569754152

Also, don't try to ""stop"" the panic attack - just be in the moment.  Say to yourself, ""I'm having a panic attack right now, but I'm not going to die or have a heart attack, plenty of people have these, and it's just my body thinking I need extra adrenaline, which I don't.""  Repeat this and believe it instead of trying to calm yourself down (which usually makes things worse)."
106,"All you have to do is notice what is happening but don't attach any emotion to it, the same way you might notice what colour the car is across the street. 

Acknowledge that your heart is beating quickly, you know you can't die from it beating fast (after all you have had panic attacks before and you are still here) the heart is an amazingly strong and resilient organ. Also, I bet you couldn't make your heart beat faster even if you tried to.

Don't fight what is happening - that is the worst thing you can do, don't be impatient or try to force anything. Just accept it, think like you are floating above it, as though it wasn't really happening to you and let time pass. Before you know it the symptoms will have gone. That is the only way to break the anxiety > negative thoughts > adrenalin > increased anxiety cycle and it will help prevent it happening again in the first place.

"
107,"Ugh. I do. They've gotten very bad to the point where I've started taking anxiety medication for them. I still get them now because no medication is perfect. So now (and before I started on meds) to cope I focus on breathing and try to look at something that's not related to my trigger. I tell myself (in my head) that this is just a false reaction. I'm not going to die. It's not this bad and it will pass. If I feel panic coming on I'll pretty much do the same thing. I try and talk myself down by using plain blunt statements. Things like my brain is overreacting, I'm not in any real harm, in 5 minutes this will be all over, breathe in breathe out nice and slow. "
108,"I do.

Unfortunately my way of dealing with them probably won't help you because I don't get the heart attack sensation. For me, lying down on the floor or grown until my vision and strength in my extremities returns usually helps. If I'm in a situation where that's not socially acceptable I usually have to excuse myself to the bathroom to throw up. Or throw up in public."
109,"I've gotten a couple, but they've never been too bad (luckily).  Deep breaths are really a good start, they're cliche for a reason.  I tell myself things like ""This is a panic attack.  Nothing is wrong with you, you're just freaking out,"" because they can be scary and make me think that there is physically something wrong.  Reminding yourself that you're not dying, you're just panicking, is good.  Trying to concentrate on something that isn't the source of your panic helps.  During my last one, I got in the shower (not smart if you think you're going to pass out, but I've never had that happen) and started focusing really hard on getting the tangles out of my hair and getting clean.

Bonus points for anyone who can get the Bene Gesserit litany against fear to work."
110,"I know I'm late here, but as a sophomore in college the workload grew as I tried to also incorporate my social life. Everything fell apart. My first panic attack felt very similar to what I've been told a heart attack would feel like. I started getting them more and more frequently. They can definitely psych you out. You need to find out what the key signs are for when you start to get them, and try ro position yourself in a way to prevent them as best possible (as my clinical psychologist told me). However, everything works differently depending on the person. I'd consider seeking professional help to see what could work best for you. For me, focusing on taking slower and deeper breaths helps the pain a bit. I wish you all the best, and hope you find what you need!"
111,"I used to get them so many times in a day that I would actually start to get chest pain.  An EKG revealed that they were indeed just panic attacks.

Mine come on without warning.  I don't have to be thinking about anything stressful or even feeling really stressed, when suddenly my heart starts to pump like crazy and it gets hard to breathe.  It happens a lot when I'm at work, and I'll usually just go ""hang on"" and sit down until it passes so I don't get lightheaded."
112,"Exactly! I also found it beneficial to go to the ER during an attack. They tested my heart and gave me the all clear. Hearing a doctor say my heart was fine, and it was just a panic attack eased my mind so much. I still hate the attacks and they are still a bit scary, but it helps to be able to remind myself that the doctor said I'm physically healthy and at basically no risk of heart attack at my age with no other risk factors. "
113,I mostly just have to let it pass. But it's really helpful to have my husband sit with me and hold me or hold my hand or something.
114,Literally I started lexapro a couple months ago and haven’t had a single panic attack since.  I have had panic disorder since a child.  But in the moment I have to have someone like hug me or bring me back to reality or kind of just cry it out and let it pass.
115,"I have to lay down, breathe, and just hope I don’t pass out. It helps when someone is there to monitor me because my heart rate goes too fast and I can hear my heart pound. I get extremely dizzy and feel as if I’m going to pass out. It can last 15 min to cycling through 8 hours.

Mine are more likely to happen if I don’t sleep well (like 2-4 hours) and haven’t eaten. So I try to get better sleep and nibble on something. I also try and avoid caffeine as much as possible.

I hope you figure out something that helps ❤️"

Among women who know they are pregnant, the miscarriage rate is about 15-20%. Most miscarriages occur during the first 7 weeks of pregnancy.

Nutrition! I don't know what this free online course will be like but it's free :) https://www.coursera.org/course/lifenutr

One of my fav fun facts: Your body uses cholesterol to make bile (among other things), bile helps you digest fats, once your digested food and bile enter your intestines your body can absorb and recycle the bile for future use - BUT - if you eat a lot of fiber it get's trapped in you stool and gets eliminated. Then your gall bladder demands more cholesterol from your body and obtains it from your blood serum. Then blood serum levels of cholesterol go down. This is how eating OLD FASHIONED oats helps you reduce your cholesterol. 

Knowing how your body will fight tooth and nail to hold on to every excess carbohydrate. And all the secret sugars (dextrose, maltodextrin, etc) [note: every carb that isn't fiber that is]. Or just get her a Michael Pollan book for Christmas or something. "

* Exercise: Does not kill you, does make you stronger. Do it. Even if it is just a short walk every day.
* Carbohydrates: eat less of them, they make your body go slow motion. Stick to complex carbs and lean protein for more energy and better moods.
"
120,"> I only have my period once every 3 months and the only reason I do is to make sure I'm not pregnant.

It can take a while for your period to settle down after stopping the pill, so don't worry if it doesn't return to normal right away.  Also, the first bleed is likely the withdrawal bleed, your body doesn't know if you've stopped altogether or just for the week.  Additionally, being on the pill shouldn't affect the result of a pregnancy test, so it's fine to just do the old pee-on-the-stick.

The advice from RememberYourPass refers to the combined pill, the mini-pill (progesterone only pill) is taken every day without breaks, and your period can remain normal, stop altogether, or anything in between.  Other methods can have different effects.

All things considered though, what every woman should know about contraception is: don't be afraid to ask your doctor (or whoever is prescribing) as many questions as you want about your contraceptive choices, including side effects, efficacy, method of action, effect on your period, and anything else that pops into your head.  There are no stupid questions.  The combined pill is most common, but far from the only option.  If you're not happy, go back and discuss it again.  If you don't think your doctor is listening to you, see somebody else.  Don't go without birth control just because the first method you tried didn't work out for you."

Because of that, she developed leg clot issues (the only one in our entire family to ever do so), had a heart attack at a young age and has had a pacemaker for longer than I can remember, possibly longer than I've been alive (I'm 24, she's about 70), and has Congestive Heart Failure on top of that. The doctors all agree that all this was most likely caused because she smoked while on birth control.

Around 25 she started regularly having episodes of severe heart arrhythmias. So bad she fainted and seriously thought she would die (and once almost did because it happened while she was driving). Every doctor she saw told her she was just having panic attacks or was hysterically imagining things and that is wasn\`t as bad as she made it out to be, because by the time she reached the doctor the attack was over and she didn't show any signs of a heart attack in the EKGs. It took more than a dozen cardiologists and over 20 years of visiting doctors for one to finally believe her. She has Wolff-Parkinson-White-Syndrom in combination with a  disorder causing the blood to clot faster and form miniscule clots that reach the heart and trigger an attack but disolve later and can't be detected. She takes blood thinners now and hasn\`t had an attack since."

I’ve been going to therapy once a week for two years now and it helps so much but I’m also taking Zoloft which helps too. Therapy has taught me a lot of different coping mechanisms and ways to comfort myself when I’m in a panic attack and that’s what has helped the most. one thing that I do when I’m in having a panic attack is practice slow breathing and then identify my five senses -  something that I’m feeling, something that I’m seeing, something that I’m smelling, something that I’m tasting and something that I’m hearing.

144,"I remind myself that this will pass and that my brain is currently in a confused frantic state. That way, I recognize that the panic attacks aren't rational and that the ""real"" me isn't consumed or defined by these ""interruptions"" (as I like to call them)."
145,"My gosh, I’m so sorry, that’s such a burden to anyone who already suffers from anxiety. It’s crazy how no matter how many times it’s happened in the past, it’s still always super convincing that nope, this is definitely the time I’m going to pass out/have a heart attack"
146,"What the symptoms are of a heart attack on women. It's not always like what you see in men on TV, who clutch their chest and keel over. It can be a chest pain, could be radiating, can be pain elsewhere, influx like symptoms, sweaty, general unwellness. "

148,"I got two things- 

My friend got breast cancer and we do a ""Feel it on the First"" of every month a self breast exam. If you are familiar with how your boobs feel and what lumpy parts are normal, you might spot a node out if it happens. She got in early because she always did this and insisted on going to the doctor's. 

I started doing this too and generally paying attention to anything going on and not brushing it off. My chest hurt and I learned that heart attacks aren't obvious  so I went to  urgent care to have it checked. It was a nerve issue but if it was a heart attack, I was at the hospital within minutes. There's only one you and you are worth not brushing your symptoms aside. Go to a check up exam! "
149,"yes!!! this was my comment. a lot of women feel ""sick"" when they are having a heart attack - nausea/vomiting, heartburn feeling, dizziness. also included are back pain (particularly upper back), shortness of breath, fatigue. like you said, its not the classic image of a man clutching his chest and falling over.  
a lot of womens symptoms can mirror anxiety symptoms  so either they brush a heart attack off as a panic/anxiety attack, or *their doctors* do and send them home!

150,"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend just did an awesome job with this on an episode recently. Everyone around the character thought it was menopause, but it turned out she was having a heart attack."
151,"This. I was watching a Ted Talk by a physician, and she was talking about how women experience heart attacks differently than men do. Heart attacks have been primarily studied in men, so symptoms in women aren't as quickly  recognized. And because their symptoms aren't often recognized, women and more likely to be brushed off, misdiagnosed, and sent home when they're in real danger."
152,"Chest pain that radiates to the areas of the shoulder, upper back, or up the jaw, are the most common points of pain spreading during a heart attack. The pain typically feels like pressure.

If you suspect you're having a heart attack of some type, call 911, first of all. If you have aspirin at home, take a 325mg dose (if it's baby aspirin, take 4. they're about 81mg each.) if you can, feel your pulse, see if it's regular or irregular, weak or strong. If you're having trouble breathing as well it could be a sign. 

Other signs include nausea or lightheadedness, and general discomfort in your chest (as opposed to pain; you'll know it if you feel it). For women, the pain typically spreads backwards instead of outwards, i.e toward the back or neck/jaw rather than up the shoulder or down the arm."

155,My Dad was never one for emotions. So we are dancing our father/daughter dance and he leans over my shoulder - he’s well over 6 feet tall and I’m a shorty - I try to move him off me and I see he’s now clutching his chest. Immediately I thought the stress of this elaborate wedding has caused him to have a heart attack! Then I see his face - he’s crying - no he’s sobbing! In front of 200+ people. He never said a word. Just cried. I’m his only daughter. Mom came over with a napkin to wipe his face.

161,"I see it a lot working in a male-dominated field. But the worst I've seen lately actually happened at the repair shop a few weeks ago. I've been driving my car for 13 years - it's great to have a car that long because you really learn the ins and outs of it, exactly what it can and can't do (maneuverability), and all the little quirks and sounds it makes. I've done a lot of my own work on it - replaced the whole tail light, replacing headlights, even replaced the window motor and regulator on the passenger side. Nothing engine related though. So basically, it's my baby. So a car has a lot of bushings. When bushings wear out, your car will start to squeak when you go over bumps (sounds a lot like a creaky bed during sex LOL). I took it in for a full inspection of the suspension and explained the sounds I was hearing. Once it was ready to pick up, my boyfriend (of 4 years) came in with me ... and the mechanic (male) only talked to my boyfriend. Things like that are irritating af. Basically, in terms of *my car*, this mechanic chose to talk to an amateur instead of the professional. "
162,"Did you know that the medical term for how women experience heart attacks is ""atypical""?

We're more than 50% of the population, but okay."

164,"Oh my yes. It's horribly embarrassing. I've read/written fic for Jane Austen, The Office, Maurice (<3), and some RPF for various bands (the shame, I was young.) 

Most recently Sherlock and Teen Wolf, mainly for the variety of fic because the fandoms are huge (and slightly scary). I barely like either show and I actively dislike Sherlock now and find both of the main actors pretty ugly and unappealing/douchey, so do not ask me to explain because I absolutely cannot. I really like gay romance stories so I like the super AU stuff that barely resembles canon. If I could I would read original fiction, but I haven't found good, consistent sources.

Yeah, I think he does enjoy hangining out with me, it's just weird because we fell into such a routine of cuddles and kisses and hugs and whatnot. He has told me recently in passing he still loves and cares for me, while he may not be IN love with me, he loves me. He still cares a lot though, I can see it on his face, and it sorta pains him as much as he likes hanging out with me, to do so.

Im just confused what to do..."
175,"When they don’t listen. I have the ability to check my doctors’ write up after a visit, I use that to determine how well they are listening. I have several conditions which interact with each other in many ways so it is important to have a doctor who is at least knowledgeable of the strangeness my presentations incur. I have EDS, temporal lobe epilepsy, chronic orthostatic hypotension and symptomatic PVC’s and bouts of SVTs.

For example, I had a cardiologist (it was actually my second too) where I was discussing my experiencing supraventricular tachycardia and orthostatic tachycardia. I have my degree in exercise physiology and worked in cardiac rehab where it was my job to recognize certain rhythms. So anyways these are two very different rhythms, SVT is generally produced by atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia where the supraventricular node (below the normal firing node) begins firing rapidly at a rate of over 200bpm. This results in the electrical ‘spark’ of the heart coming from the center of the heart rather than above the right atria so there are very obvious EKG changes when this occurs that can be seen even on an Apple Watch Telemetry. It also generally lasts only about 60 seconds before normal sinus rhythm is reattained and you’ll see a space in the telemetry where you skip a beat before abruptly going from 200+bpm to whatever it was before.

Orthostatic tachycardia on the other hand is normal sinus rhythm but is unusually fast, generally just 100+bpm at rest and may present with extreme raises upon standing or moving. It can last a really long time, generally for me I’ll experience it for an hour or more, there is no clear cut begin or end for this, tends to come on gradually and leave the same way.

So I experience both of these individually and at different times/triggers. SVT occurs when I’m working out generally after an impactful movement (ie. Box jumps, fast squats) while OT can occur fairly randomly.

So I explained both of these to the doctor and he kept interrupting me going back and forth between the two and I could see he was getting mixed up and not really paying attention and wouldn’t even look at the Apple telemetry I had. He ultimately told me there was nothing he could do and that there were no cardiologists in the clinic I went to that treated EDS related cardiac issues. We’re talking a chain of over 6 locations so I found this highly skeptical.

When I reviewed his notes I found that he hadn’t separated the two conditions and instead reported that I experienced sinus tachycardia of 100+ bpm for a minute at a time upon standing. Which was not at all what I’d described. I sent a message to my current overseeing doctor pointing out the blatant errors in their reporting and she helped me get transferred to another cardiologist who was faaaar more helpful and thorough in their approach. 

He was the one who ended up diagnosing me with orthostatic hypotension and this was after 2 other cardiologists had just written off my symptoms. honestly I’m not sure why it hadn’t occurred to me because I’ve always had low BP but that’s why even other medical professionals work with doctors. He also helped me coordinate different lifestyle changes and now I’m managing it without even using medication. Although now I get to call coffee my medication (hehe). 

He also was open to discussing getting a cardiac ablation at some point to help the PVCs and SVT that I get. Something that no doctor has brought up, probably because I’m only 28 and I’ve found many doctors are highly resistant to admitting when young people have medical issues.

I also had my focal seizures ignored for four years with doctors telling me they were ‘weird panic attacks’ up until I hallucinated and had an extreme postictal state where I basically lost consciousness. Scared the shit out of my husband. Really pissed me off that my neurologist was immediately like, these sound like temporal lobe seizures. We need to run a full seizure panel, you may need to have an EMU stay, etc. and here I’d been dealing with these for years and thinking I was just really resistant to anxiety medication. Enough said, I don’t work with that doctor who insisted they were panic attacks anymore."

She said she felt out of breath, and like her arms had just turned to lead. I wanted to call 911 but she was ADAMANT that she was fine. 

Fast forward a few weeks, she's been exhausted. She's missed so much work because she's ready to nap by 2pm, and needs to go home. She hasn't felt heavy and leaden since that night, but her chest and back felt really tight. After 3 weeks of feeling like this, she finally went to a hospital. Turns out she had a ""serious cardiac event"" and needed a stent put in. She was hospitalized for about a week. 

She said it never felt painful or sharp, and it didn't feel sudden like in movies. One day she was able to run up a flight of stairs and cook dinner, and the next day she needed to nap by 2pm and couldn't handle walking for 10 minutes without a rest.

184,"I haven't had a heart attack, but since these stories are being shared I wanted to note the difference between cardiac arrest and a heart attack. My father had a heart attack without going into arrest and somehow this wasn't communicated to my brother or me so we didn't fully grasp what was happening, and I've since heard many people dismiss their symptoms because they don't match a movie scenario.

Below is an abbreviated version from the [American Heart Association](http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks/heart-attack-or-sudden-cardiac-arrest-how-are-they-different), but they have the full signs and symptoms of a heart attack or stroke on their website. As well as info on Hands-Only CPR. Hopefully okay to share here.

""People often use these terms interchangeably, but they are not synonyms. A heart attack is when blood flow to the heart is blocked, and sudden cardiac arrest is when the heart malfunctions and suddenly stops beating unexpectedly. A heart attack is a “circulation” problem and sudden cardiac arrest is an “electrical” problem.
 
Symptoms of a heart attack may be immediate and intense. More often, though, symptoms start slowly and persist for hours, days or weeks before a heart attack. Unlike with sudden cardiac arrest, the heart usually does not stop beating during a heart attack. The heart attack symptoms in women can be different than men.

Sudden cardiac arrest occurs suddenly and often without warning. It is triggered by an electrical malfunction in the heart that causes an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). With its pumping action disrupted, the heart cannot pump blood to the brain, lungs and other organs. Seconds later, a person loses consciousness and has no pulse. Death occurs within minutes if the victim does not receive treatment.""


"
185,"This question is SO IMPORTANT!!!! I haven’t, but in my life support class we learned it is a fact that heart attacks feel different for women than men. It’s not as widely known as it should be, but women need to know that a heart attack won’t feel/look like the classic signs. "
186,"I have not had a heart attack but I am a nurse who works in a hospital unit that deals with them on a regular basis :)

Just for clarification, as another Redditor pointed out, a ""heart attack"" is a term commonly applied to two different scenarios: a blockage in a coronary artery that causes heart muscle damage (myocardial infarction) OR when the heart isn't pumping blood properly and essentially stops (cardiac arrest), causing a person to essentially die unless someone helps (I.e. CPR +/- defibrillation). However, the two aren't necessarily exclusive - a myocardial infarction *can* cause a cardiac arrest if left untreated (though cardiac arrests aren't always caused by myocardial infarctions, and there are different types of cardiac arrests.....yeah, it's complicated lol).

So for this post, I'm going to assume ""heart attack"" to mean myocardial infarction, which is more common but harder to diagnose (because let's be real, if you go into cardiac arrest, you die, and that's not hard to miss).

The classic symptoms of a myocardial infarction are:

* Chest pain or pressure (often described as squeezing, like a band over the chest, or ""like an elephant sitting on the chest"")
* Pain radiating to the left arm and/or jaw
* Shortness of breath
* Nausea +/- vomiting
* Sweating
* Just generally feeling that something is very wrong

However, I've also seen lots of people say they had vague symptoms.

Most common of the subtle symptoms is the feeling of indigestion or heartburn. I can't count the amount of times I've heard the story of ""ate a big meal, went to bed, woke up with indigestion, took an antacid, and still felt like shit, continued to take antacids, and when I felt really unwell, went to the hospital."" The general rule of thumb I like to stick to is, if you're having heartburn and it won't go away with heartburn treatment, see a doctor. Even if it's ""just"" heartburn, you'll want to get it treated, anyway, because if left uncontrolled, it can damage your esophagus.

Other vague symptoms would be things like back pain, arm pain, nausea, intense fatigue, and dizziness. In fact, a couple of times, I've had patients who had no symptoms at all until we ran some tests on them; this is most common in people with diabetes.

While women are more likely to have the non-traditional signs and symptoms, men can have them, too, just like women can also have the classic signs. In fact, my first patient with a silent heart attack (no signs or symptoms) was a man!

So yeah, it's not very cut and dry but if you are ever concerned, please just call 911 (or whatever number you call for an ambulance) and get yourself to a hospital. Even if it turns out to be nothing, don't feel embarrassed or feel like you've wasted our time. We always take potential cardiac symptoms seriously because it's hard for us to tell, too, based on signs and symptoms alone, and the tests are fairly easy and quick. And  like a lot of other major ailments, it's best to get treated early rather than let it go on and on, potentially causing major damage.

Lastly, because I always get messaged, *please* no one ask me medical questions about you or a specific person. I cannot make assessments and give advice over the internet. If you have concerns about yourself or a loved one, please see a doctor in person."
187,"My mom had one last year and said it wasn't what men are known to experience at all. She had gone to bed and felt uneasy, said her heart started to ""smash and bang"" and generally felt anxious and unwell. She said she just knew something was wrong and suspected a heart attack, as they run in the family (she was the fourth of her siblings to have one within a three-year span) and my grandmother had died of one when I was a baby. My dad drove her to the hospital and it was confirmed she had a ""mild, non-stemi"" heart attack. Heart disease seems to be hitting the family younger and younger so my brother and I are probably at risk of developing it too.

188,"“HNGGHHHH” - me, during my heart attack"
189,"Which part exactly is false? My point was that [women are more likely to experience non-traditional/not-so-obvious signs and symptoms](http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/warning-signs-of-a-heart-attack/heart-attack-symptoms-in-women), but men can, too. The signs and symptoms are really variable across the board.

Quoted directly from the linked page from the American Heart Association:

>“Although men and women can experience chest pressure that feels like an elephant sitting across the chest, women can experience a heart attack without chest pressure, ” said Nieca Goldberg, M.D., medical director for the Joan H. Tisch Center for Women's Health at NYU’s Langone Medical Center and an American Heart Association volunteer. “Instead they may experience shortness of breath, pressure or pain in the lower chest or upper abdomen, dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting, upper back pressure or extreme fatigue.”

Or from the [Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.ca/heart/conditions/heart-attack):

>Women generally recognize the “Hollywood heart attack” with chest-clutching, crushing pain. If their pain is less severe, or if they have non-pain signs such as nausea, sudden fatigue or shortness of breath (signs more often reported by women), they are more likely to delay getting to emergency care, and once there, they are less likely to get fast, aggressive treatment."
190,"Realist, I suppose. Though I suspect that's what all pessimists consider themselves to be.

I seem to be significantly less emotional than most of my peers. I see all things rationally, I think that limits my ability to be romantic. I also work in health care where part of my job is attending all cardiac arrests and shutting down the life support. I see people die all the time, a lot. Apparently I am well suited to this line of work because even as a student it never really bugged me, while a lot of my classmates recall stories of driving home from a shift in tears because of a death they saw. 

This has never affected my ability to be compassionate, and I always do my best to give my patients the utmost care. But when they die I find myself feeling like that's just the way life goes. I see the chain of events that lead to it, I understand the medical reasons for it. I feel bad for the family's grieving process and how it will affect their lives moving forward. 

Its not a matter of me not understanding emotion. I can be very empathetic. I'm just not very sympathetic, perhaps. Life happens the way it happens. It doesn't always occur positively, but when it happens negatively I don't find myself very bothered.

Edit: Optimists downvoting me, perhaps? What if I told you all health care workers joke around during cardiac arrests, we aren't sobbing about it. If you deal with death day in and day out you stop caring so much."
191,"**Wall of text, sorry... but I believe I covered most things**

It's pretty standard to do an abdominal examination on top of a respiratory and cardiac examination when examining patients. Putting the stethoscope down around the abdomen gives one an idea as to whether or not the bowels are moving, which is a sign of bowel health. Bowel sounds aren't always heard right off the bat, so sometimes one has to move the stethoscope around (the recommendation is to listen for up to 1-5minutes depending on the resource... but nobody ever has that much time). A proper abdominal examination has to expose the area up until slightly above the pelvic region.

Some materials are harder to listen through, and it's not so much the thickness of it every time. I find it easy enough to listen through say something like cotton, but through some swishy fabrics and the like, I can't hear jack shit, and will require access underneath it. Occasionally, the bra/breasts can interfere with a cardiac exam, if they're too big, which in turn prevents the stethoscope from being placed in the appropriate areas. 

Him calling in the nurse was supposed for legal purposes; she's there to attest to the fact that everything he did was a part of a normal medical examination, and that there was no funny business going on. You'd be surprised how damaging a false accusation can be, and as a result, many doctors now are a bit apprehensive. Many robes are designed to open up at the back actually, and are supposed to be put with the un-opened end at the front, and the slit/opening at the back... kind of like putting on a coat on backwards; the typical blue/white ones that you see in many north american hospitals are designed as such. It sounds to me like you might have put it on backwards.

He came from behind so that he'd have an easier time listening to the lungs. It's personal preference whether one listens to the lungs from the back or front, but the heart sounds can make listening from the front a bit harder, so many like to listen from the back, then go back to the front for the cardiac and abdominal exam. It has nothing to do with looking at your panties. 

There are lots of sounds that one can check for/make sure is normal in the abdomen, including the flow of blood to your kidneys, the aorta down there, and the like. He's technically not listening to your heart over there, but there are parts of a typical cardiac exam that are performed outside of what the general public associates with the heart (i.e. outside of the immediate chest). It was likely done as part of a global examination. 

The wires that they stick to the body... does the term EKG or ECG sound familiar? Or Heart Exam? He might have heard an incidental sound when listening to the heart, and ordered an ECG (which is an electrical tracing of the heart, as the electricity surges through various aspects of it) to see if he could pick up an abnormality. As a clinician, while it's nice to get the report from the technician who does it, some of us like to see the ECG tracing itself to verify. Yes it has to be topless, because the wires cross all over the chest... it's measuring electric currents across the heart, which incidentally happens to be placed in the chest. Putting things on top of the wires, moving around during the read, or even crossing wires in some shittier machines, can cause artefacts which ruin the ""image""/result. Judging by the fact that he asked for her to bring it back to him, suggests that he's sending your sister away to do it... which is consistent with normal medical practice. He's having a technician do it. If he wanted to molest your sister, you'd think he'd want to do it himself so that he would have more opportunities to access your sister's chest, no?

Sometimes it's easier to just tell patients that you're listening to something else than what you are actually listening for, so that they don't get confused. They don't have the training or knowledge to understand why a sound in the abdomen can be related to the heart, so to make things easier, some people just say ""heart sounds"" etc., as a general encompassing term. If I said ""oh, I'm just going to check to see if you have a triple A or dissection,"" you'd probably be confused, so it would make both our lives easier if I just said ""I'm going to listen for a heart sound or aorta sound down here."" The confusion behind what he was doing can lead to misunderstanding; in the future, if you feel uncomfortable, just ask them what they are listening/checking for, and they can explain to you in better detail. 

Multiple patients in the room, technically shouldn't be done, but often is given time constraints and practicality. Depending on how important it is to get a clear sound on that particular organ, one may choose to just cursory listen over the clothes, or may feel the need to get firm contact between the stethoscope and skin (the sound improves significantly in some cases). If for example, you come in with something I believe is clearly abdominal in origin, I might give your heart and lungs a cursory listen just to make sure nothing big is going on there...and for that I probably would just quickly do it over the clothes, barring any thick/undesirable fabric. If he stayed in the room while you were undressing, he was probably just in a rush to get the exam over with so he could see the next patient, filling out paper work, or a variety of other things. As to gloves, if it's just to do a superficial exam (i.e. I don't have to stick any fingers into any orifices, you aren't bleeding/oozing fluids, and there aren't any lesions/infections on the skin), some people may just wash their hands and go at it (it's a preference thing, as gloves reduce tactile sensation and can get in the way of things). The filthier it is, the more likely most doctors are to put on gloves (to protect both you and them). 

Since it was your first time at this clinic, it was likely that he was trying to do a baseline of all your organ systems, so that in the event that something new happens (i.e. Oh no, my chest hurts... and he examines it and hears a new sound in there that based on a previous exam wasn't there, he has a pretty good idea that something pretty big might have happened) he has something to compare to. Follow up appointments are nice, because they're usually faster as one can pretty much just verify ""no change"" occurred in non-involved organs. 

Based on what you described, it honestly doesn't sound like anything inappropriate occurred. If anything, it was most likely a miscommunication. If you feel strongly about it though, you can always lodge a complaint against him, though if based on his previous history and performance it appears unlikely that he did anything, it likely will be acknowledged and thrown out. You'd be surprised how often doctors get accused of something malicious, when in reality it was standard practice or a procedure that was just poorly communicated. Busy physicians unfortunately do not take the time to explain to patients what they are going to do, which can be confusing and alarming to patients, when simple reassurance is all that's needed."
192,"I produce struvite stones and my diet has no affect on them as they’re infection related. I’m on a nightly low-dose antibiotic but that’s to try to prevent any more big kidney infections. 

I have to go in every 3 months for my stent to be changed (my ureter has collapsed a number of times and the stent keeps it open) as I produce stone around the stent and if it’s left in too long, it’s impossible to remove (they know this because they detached my ureter resulting in emergency surgery to reattach it), and also for scans and x-rays to check the progress of my stones. If any are too big for me to pass, I’m booked in for lithotripsy. That’s the best they can do"
193,"Nope. They aren't nutritious enough to be worth it to me (SUPER high in cholesterol); also hens will often eat their own unfertilized eggs to replenish the nutrients lost from laying them so I would prefer to just let my hypothetical chickens do their thang with their own bodily secretions.

**Edit:** Eggs are not a necessary part of a healthy diet. See [newyeornewme's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/6n4van/vegan_women_if_you_raised_your_own_backyard/dk8cfvo/) for info. Perhaps genetics have more to do with cholesterol, but that does not mean that the food you eat has no effect on it. It stands to reason that someone who avoids eating too much cholesterol likely has healthier levels than someone who doesn't, if they're coming from the same genetic risk. I *personally* don't find them nutritious enough to be worth eating because I just generally don't favor eating the bodily secretions of other animals. How this is controversial when all I did was answer the question I guess I don't understand."
194,"Why is it a problem that eggs have cholesterol given they do not impact negatively on your blood cholesterol levels (actually most research shows they lower LDL and raise HDL)?

They also have protein, unsaturated + omega-3 fat, multiple vitamins and minerals. I get that people don't like eggs from an ethics point of view but to say they are not very nutritious is factually incorrect. "
195,"While I understand that there are many good reasons not to eat eggs, your body needs the type of cholesterol that is found in eggs. I hope you aren't avoiding it entirely."
196,"We've known for years now that genetics, not diet, is the driving force behind blood cholesterol levels. Also, eggs are [extremely nutritious](http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/good-eggs-for-nutrition-theyre-hard-to-beat#1). "
197,"Total bs, the claim that fat and cholesterol are bad for you is flat wrong."
198,Cholesterol is required to build every single cell in your body. It's not something to be avoided. 
199,"Yep. Our brains are made of cholesterol. Our organs have a protective layering of fat around them to protect them. Our muscles have intramuscular fat that is used as an energy store. 

We need fat and cholesterol. "
200,"The idea of ""good"" cholesterol is misleading. That is the animal based cholesterol that many people have too much of, but it is still necessary. What you want is a good HDL and LDL ratio."
201,Exactly. Especially for vegans and vegetarians who are not getting too much cholesterol from animal sources like many people on the SAD.
202,"I won't get into the affiliations of the editorial board in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (wherein this study was published), but that article itself even says ""The study also suggests that the overall health effects of foods are difficult to anticipate based on an individual nutrient such as cholesterol alone.""

As I stated in my original comment, eggs are not nutritious enough for me to want to eat in that they are secretions from an animal, and when I sat down and considered this, I found it to be pretty gross. The potential health benefits, for *me*, do not outweigh the gross-out factor."
203,"No particular cheese, but that port salut sounds delicious! Unfortunately, I'm on a self-imposed cheese ban for a while, since my cholesterol levels were on the high side last time I had it checked, and I'm trying to avoid too much saturated fat :( Mmm, cheese..."
204,"Port Salut is like, the most amazing cheese. I never buy a whole wheel of it otherwise I would eat the whole thing in one sitting. I have to make do with a wedge of it every few months left lest I succumb to cheese-induced cholesterol. "
205,"So it looks like the latest science indicates that saturated fat/cholestrol in the diet may have little to no bearing on blood cholesterol - that was a myth started in the early 80s by a cardiologist (because it does make sense), and they think that the low-fat movement it spawned us what is behind the obesity epidemic now. 

The thinking now is that the culprit is sugar. I can say anecdotally that when I excised sugar (added and natural) from my diet, and upped my fat intake (including eggs and cheese and bacon), my triglycerides fell by half in a couple months. Good cholesterol went up and bad cholesterol went way down, making my ratio better.  (Side benefit - weight loss!)

Just some food for thought. Cutting sugar is hard...but you do get to eat cheese!  "
206,"dietary fiber. It gives your poops good structure and traps your bile in your stool. Your body can use your lower intestine to retrieve your bile to recycle it. Cholesterol is used in producing bile. If you eliminate your bile with your stool you create a good demand for cholesterol that you consume in eggs and cheese burgers. Because you'll have to produce more bile replaced the amount you eliminated. This is how diets high in dietary fiber helps lower blood serum cholesterol levels. 

Plus it is a slow burning complex carb, great for breakfast. "
207,A half hour is a big deal if it's consistently not there.
208,"Be aware that people heal differently. I found out from getting Microblading and line-work in a tattoo that my skin just won't hold a fine line. Both became a little blurry and thicker even though both were done by very experienced professionals. 

My eyebrows had perfect strokes that matches the hair exactly when they were done. I followed aftercare exactly, but they lost that hair stroke look and now look more like makeup or tattooed. They also haven't faded at all, which I have mixed feelings about. [These photos](https://imgur.com/a/bvaPitG) are over two years apart. 

Last thing is to be sure you know exactly how close together you want them. Strokes can be added in the touch up but not taken away. I was so focused on the shape and I thought there was a standard of going straight up from the inner eye, nope. My brows are in line with current beauty standards, but closer together than I prefer and they also are more permanent than I originally expected."
209,"I got it done because my friend started a business doing it and I wanted to support her. 
I didn’t think it would make a huge difference to be honest, because I asked her to just keep it natural. 

I LOVE it. I’ve had it topped up twice (over two years) and it looks great. 
They really do look like hair strokes, and even though I will still gently outline my brows when I do full Glam, I love that I can run out barefaced and still have some definition. It really makes me feel more confident and gives structure .
Also I feel like any brow tinting seems to last longer (obviously it doesn’t but having the base colour seems to make a diff)

Pain wise, I’d probably say a low 6/10? The actual scalping bit didn’t hurt too much, but the ink stung quite a lot. 
For reference, I’d rate Botox a 2/10 and filler a high 4/10. 

If you’re thinking about doing it, I’d say go for it, but be aware that over time the lines can bleed so they look less like hair strokes and more smudged? I don’t know how else to describe it, but it’s no different than filling it with pencil or powder IMO. 

As for the scabbing while it heals, meh wasn’t a huge issue to me. Just chuck some lanolips or something on it and it’s grand."
210,"I got microshading done which is just manual shading and strokes. I absolutely LOVED the result but I found that after the healing process I had lost quite a bit of the pigment. Luckily a touch up was included in the price that I paid and when I went in the second time, the pigment stuck a little better. 

After a few months the definition of some of the strokes wore off, which was disappointing but sort of expected considering that I have combination skin that tends to lean towards oily. So I did find myself filling in my brows again within a few months, but I at least had a shape to follow which makes the whole process of doing my makeup much faster. 

It’s been a year now and overall I’m satisfied with how it turned out for me. The hair strokes have faded almost completely but the shading is still there, albeit somewhat faded, but I still feel like it makes a HUGE difference.

The only cons I can think of are 1.) the price, it’s expensive! 2.) it’s not totally permanent and you may or may not be happy with your final outcome depending on your skin tip and whether you decide on manual or machine work 3.) the healing process kind of sucks. It gets really itchy and your brows will look like trash for at least a week, and you can’t put anything on them in the meantime to cover it up.

I’ve been wanting to go back to get my yearly touch up and maybe upgrade to hybrid brows (manual stokes and machine blading, much better suited for oily skin types) but haven’t been able to because of COVID."
211,From all the pictures of the work she had done I always liked the look of those the most. It’s sort of the best of both worlds as there’s strokes to mimic the look of individual brow hairs and the tattoo part sort of filled in around the micro blading and my natural brows.
212,"Yeah, mine weren’t cheap either. The first time, I paid about $450 and the second time I used a Groupon and paid $300. It maybe lasted about 7-8 weeks before I had to start filling in again. I spend about about $200 a year on Anastasia eyebrow pencils and it takes about 5 minutes or so to do my brows. So, I’m just filling in my brows again. I want to do something more permanent but not sure what. 
You will probably like how it looks because the tech will out line your brow and mark the strokes in the brow. The hardest part is it won’t last a year."
213,"Depends on the friend. A friend of mine and I are very close and we’ve been friends a long time so we both know if we’re touchy-feely with each other it’s completely platonic. We hold hands sometimes, stroke each others hair, hug a lot etc. With other friends i have more boundaries. It all comes to how close you are and how good they are with accepting it’s platonic."
214,"It depends on a friend. I’ve kissed with my male friend at a football game. We were watching a football game at the stadium and it was almost the end of time and our team scored. We started screaming and then just kissed. With tomgue. It was pure joy, nothing awkward happened after, no embarassment, no feelings, we just went over it like nothing happened. It was 4 years ago. Nothing changed. 

But it’s long cuddles with most of them what I think could be a boundary. I can play with their hands, hold their hand as we walk in public, stroke their hair, but I noticed myself I do it more playfully with them, the movements are different than when I stroke hair or hold hands with someone I love."
215,"Occasionally hugs hello or goodbye.  Might bump or slight touch to get their attention but the words play, cuddle, or stroke are not involved in my platonic friendships."
216,"In non-pandemic times, I’m happy to hug my platonic male friends! But it’s  not... especially tight or intimate. If someone isn’t a hugger, I won’t hug them, a handshake is fine! 

I would never cuddle with a platonic friend or stroke his hair."
217,">Would you ever play with his hands, cuddle with him, stroke his hair etc

I wouldn't do that with anyone I'm not dating. 

I hug. That's about it. And even that's a rarity - I'm not a hugger. (Of course, that means, when I do give hugs, people are like over the freaking moon about it.)"
218,"> Would you ever play with his hands, cuddle with him, stroke his hair etc. Where is the line drawn for you?

Sure. This is why I usually end up fucking them and don't really have platonic male friends, unless I am myself in a relationship (and then I definitely don't do this)."
219,I don't play with his hands or stroke his hair. I'll cuddle for sure. Basically just the same as I would with a platonic female friend. I draw the line at whatever one of us is uncomfortable with.
220,"Complete posture change when I see a boy I fancy. Stand/sit up straight, shoulders back, chin up. And then when they pass it's *whoosh* back to Quasimodo."
221,"Recently noticed that never has a girl stroked her hair when coming my way, does anyone else feel like shit?"
222,"I think it's an intimate gesture.

Which is why it would piss me off if a guy touched or stroked my face.  Don't violate my personal boundries."
223,"I don't even really like it when my boyfriend touches and strokes my face, unless he's being very gentle and we're already being kinda intimate."
224,I hate it. My reaction would probably be to slap their hand away if they tried. Really weird to me if someone wanted to touch/stroke my face.
225,"Nope.  I will try with all my might to open a tough jar because I want to stroke my own ego.  When I ask a guy to open it, it's out of defeat."
226,">I swear that pickle jar my mom handed me was loose as a goose.  

Have you never heard someone say ""Loosened it for you""?  It's pretty common for someone to struggle with a jar, hand it to someone, and the next person opens it easily.  My fiance will had my jars to open sometimes and I get them open easily.  He certainly isn't trying to stroke my ego over it."
227,"Turn the jar over on a stable surface, insert a flathead screwdriver between the cap and the jar and pry outward to break the vacuum seal. Turn the jar upright and open the jar. Men won't confuse your inability to open the jar with wanting to stroke their ego again. "
228,"No way man, if I am asking him to open a pickle jar it's because I really want to eat a pickle. I ain't got time for this game of ""Tee hee baby open this jar"" because that's gonna delay my pickle consumption by *at least* 45 seconds and ain't nobody got time for that.

There are way better ways to stroke his ego than to prove his grip strength has utilitarian uses. Now lemme at dem pickles."
229,"I find that prevention is alot better than trying to find a solution. 

-Do not use a lot of pressure. If you have a quality razor in good condition, you won't need to. Don't use a dirty, dull, clogged or rusted razor.  Your razor should be Clean and
very sharp. A men's razor is a really good option for those who are very hairy. Don't cheap out and over use with your razor. Replace frequently. 

-Shave slowly, one small stroke at a time making sure to rinse your razor with every stroke so it won't clog. 

- Shave with the grain/down strokes the whole way through, then add much more cream to shave in longer up strokes for the closest shave. 

- I don't recommend the foams in a can, Conditioner smooths the hair making it easier to to shave so you won't have to apply unnecessary pressure. Olay body ribbons is a great option too.

- Most importantly do NOT shave very short stubble. I'm not sure why, but it almost always causes the razor burn and ingrown hairs to shave that way. Wait for there to be some length before shaving again, your results will be much softer and smoother that way."
230,"yes.

He should thrust in me the way I tell him to based on how I'm feeling at the moment, or to match the mood of the sexual encounter, or however the spirit moves him. If I need a change, I'll let him know. Though generally I like slower long/deep strokes in the beginning and after my orgasm, and faster long/deep strokes at climax.

penis alone doesn't make me come, along with most women. So if my clit's not being handled, doesn't really matter how he's strokin'."
231,"No way your dick is going into me is going to make me cum.  I need something to be rubbing my clit for me to cum.

That said, I like shallow strokes ""best"" because I get more of a feeling of my vaginal opening being stretched- which is pleasurable.  Though if I had an entire encounter where the guy only put his dick like an inch and a half into me I'd be really unsatisfied."
232,"70% of women can not orgasm off of penetration alone. And most women will (likely) agree that the ""strokes"" she likes are entirely based off of mood at that exact moment. "
233,"None of that will get me off.


I like it to be changed up. Start with Long strokes, go deeper as the sex gets more intense, move to different ones based on how you are feeling and how I am reacting. 


For which ones just ""feel best,"" I like really deep, long strokes."
234,"Deep short strokes are my favourite because constantly coming almost entirely out of me on every stroke tends to drain my natural lubrication and start to irritate me pretty quickly, and also because staying right in there but moving tends to mean his pubic bone will be rubbing just right against my clit."
235,"Honestly I love deep short strokes. Having him all the way in just feels better to me. Plus he's mentioned during that he gets off on me being able to take it all, which turns me on even more"
236,A mix between the first two. But mostly Deep short strokes. 
237,"I like don't even know what any of that means, like I can't connect your three concepts to what is actually going on during sex. I think you're making it way too complicated. I've also never heard the word ""strokes"" used like that, I feel like you stroke something with your hand. But anyway, I have never, and don't expect to ever, cum from a penis inside me, and I would hope you can kind of tell from the girl's reactions what feels good to her. And one kind of thrusting might feel better in one position than another, etc., so I feel like this is impossible to answer. "
238,"My favourite is more of a ""medium"". Deep-ish, but not so deep that he's hitting my cervix, because that hurts. I like a longer stroke, but it doesn't have to be so long that he's almost all the way out. 

That said, I do like variety and sometimes I'm more in the mood for one thing than another. Also, position/angle, his penis size, etc. will affect what feels good. 

But when I'm closer to orgasm, I prefer a fast stroke against my g-spot, so there's less need for him to go deep/long. I orgasm easiest when I squeeze my thighs together (with his legs on the outside of mine), so that tends to limit his thrusting ability mainly to the entrance of my vagina. 



"
239,"> He should thrust in me the way I tell him to based on how I'm feeling at the moment, or to match the mood of the sexual encounter, or however the spirit moves him. 

Beautifully put.

The motions and the rhythm depend on the situation. There is no one holy grail, no one glove that fits all.

I generally don't like shallow short strokes much though. I emotionally and physically prefer him to remain relatively deep in me at all times. It's not important how far he actually reaches into me; I just like the feeling of having all of him in me and there not being much space between us left.

Had I to decide on one, deep, short, slow would be my choice."
240,I don't really. I'll compliment him and praise him when he's done something well but I don't have time to stroke fragile egos.
241,"Insecure people like their egos stroked. Let's not brand all men as being like that.

As it is, I don't do ego-stroking. I give compliments when appropriate, but would never make any special calculated effort to do so, and certainly not to stroke an ego. I don't deal with insecure people."
242,"I agree, I'm not one to baby anyone who craves constant attention.

That being said... part of what I like about a relationship/sex is the vulnerability of it, the openess.  I like that I can be *real* for a moment, with a person who I care about.  And I like opening myself up to them.  So while I wouldn't say I need the validation of an ""ego stroke"" I always appreciate it.

Anyways, I compliment my partner like all the time.  I tell her about things I've never told anyone, or things I normally keep to myself.  I ask her questions constantly along those same lines.  There is a lot of physical affection, a lot of aftercare post coital, a lot of discussion post coital.  

She does the same for me.  Talking is the main thing.  Like it's just nice to hear I'm sexy, or that I'm smart, or that she gets me, even if there is still that nagging voice that constantly says ""don't believe it, stupid"".  I'm meeting her parents soon, that will be cool.  I don't know, there are little things that are appreciated forms of validation... but I feel confident that no one would ever describe me as fragile or thirsty.  It's just nice being real with someone."
243,"I’ve been denied birth control b/c I had auras with my migraines- increased risk of stroke. Funny story- my husband HAS a vasectomy but I couldn’t stand the periods ... I had figured out what was triggering the migraines and told my doc and still got a “no.”  Some unsolicited advice- have you tried an elimination diet? I found out my migraines were triggered by gluten, soy and legumes. God, I truly miss hummus and bread. 

"
244,"I have had similar experiences, unfortunately. I don’t have auras with my migraines (which I’ve been led to believe theoretically increases stroke risk), so I use a low estrogen combination pill. I’ve been on this type of pill for 13 years with no issues. I also have no other stroke risk factors (age, smoking, etc). 

Funnily enough, my neurologist who I saw for migraines knew I was on the pill and never blinked at it. It’s only ever been GYN providers who were not well versed. 

I definitely have gotten super annoyed in the past because **pregnancy** is not without risk for stroke either. So, overall I’d rather take my chances with the pill. "
245,"For some, like myself, hormones have a huge affect on migraines. Which is why it's common to get one around the time of your period.

Last year, my hormones were totally out of whack. I was acting like a psychopath and my migraines have never been worse. It got to the point where I was experiencing confusion, I couldnt form basic sentences and I forgot very simple words that we say often. Like ""where"" or ""about"". 

A whole year went by before I figured out what was happening. It turned out that I had an extremely serious issue in my body that was making my hormone levels fluctuate like crazy. Once I had surgery, my hormones went back to normal over time and my migraines decreased significantly.

I'm pretty sure estrogen has a lot to do with pain receptors in the brain (hence the stroke-like symptoms I was experiencing) which is why some BC is too risky. But I could be wrong. 

The body is so wild. People don't pay enough attention to their hormones and they should. They're indicators when something isn't right."
246,"Some doctors don't think there's a link but there just has to be! It makes too much sense. Or your doctor did take it into consideration but didn't feel it'd be harmful. 

My doctor looked at the type, frequency and strength of my migraines as well as my overall risk of a stroke to which he said ""hell no to BC"".
And that's because I was already having these micro-strokes, as he so nicely put it, without BC. 
I guess it's all just situational.


I'm glad it was a false alarm for you though. That's a pretty terrible thing to mistake. 
"
247,"So, we make ""hmm"" sounds back and forth to each other for a bit.  It usually starts with him and then I'll repeat, and then he does it again.  We go back and forth, very softly and gently repeating ""hmm"" until either we fall asleep again or start talking with real words.

He also gives me ""giraffe kisses.""  If you've ever seen how a giraffe uses its lips to grip something or ""lip"" on something, he does that to me but with kisses.  It makes me laugh.

We also hold hands and face each other, so sometimes he kisses my forehead or pulls my thigh up so it's on his waist.  My favorite is when he rubs my back or strokes my hair.  Sometimes he'll just rest his hand on my head and it makes me calm and sleepy immediately.

Edit: I remembered giraffe kisses!"
248,"I had a nightmare once while sleeping over at his house, I don't remember what it was about but I remember waking up curled tightly in the fetal position to find I was shaking and audibly whimpering, he rolled over and kissed my forehead before stroking my side. I fell back asleep pretty quickly feeling soothed and safe. 
He was asleep when he did it though. He had no memory of it the next morning. He soothed my nightmare instinctively in his sleep and I turned to goo. 

Also when we are sitting on the couch and watching a sport together I will generally lay with my head on his lap facing the tv, and he will lay his hand on my arm and idly stroke it. I love it. "
249,"He generally has a hard time staying awake when we are cuddling. He passes out pretty much instantly when he lays on my chest or stomach. It's pretty cute. 

Also when we spoon he will feel my thighs and hips (also butt) and I hear him whispering ""fuck...goddamn... Holy fuck"". Makes me feel good about myself. I'm glad thick thighs are in because my family used to make fun of me for it. My time to shine!!!"
250,"He puts his arm around me and the weight makes me feel safe. Or if we're cuddling but not going to sleep, he always strokes wherever his hand is on my body, doesn't just leave it there. "
251,"I've go a haircut which is quite long at the front but short at the back, and he strokes the shorter ones the wrong way with the back of his finger. And the contented little sighs while smelling my hair are always good. "
252,"Strokes my hair and back, gives me kisses on the top of my head, forehead, neck, etc."
253,My FWB would always stroke his thumb along the side of my face parallel to my ear and I loved it.
254,"I usually have to grasp something tightly so I won't hurt him, or myself, as I thrash uncontrollably (he's too good at it for his own good). But with one hand, I usually stroke whatever part of him I can reach, if any (I usually can't). Playing with myself really helps push me over the edge, especially after the first orgasm. I hope you feel free to do this next time, because I really hope it goes from ""ok"" to ""mindblowing"" for you, soon."
255,"Go on a little journey in your head. Stroke their shoulders and arms. Massage their scalp. But remember, concentrate on your orgasm."
256,"Stroke hair, touch arms/shoulders. I like having my hands pinned during sometimes too so that’s fun. "
257,"My Dad and I have had a hard time as I grew up. Several years ago we patched things up and have enjoyed having him in my and my child's life. He got married a while back (step mother) to a Korean lady who appeared quite sweet. He then had a stroke about 15 years later. He doesn't hardly remember anything from his life. 

Post stroke my father's wife took over everything. Would not allow us to know some things that were going on with him. I paid personal bills of theirs to the tune of about $2,000.00 including medical, tire repairs on her car and even groceries. I spent several days helping to care for him for the first few days.

She accused me of not allowing my father to be in a extended care facility and that I stopped him from going (we were actually waiting a few days on insurance company to approve placement - had nothing to do with me. This was explained to her by several people on the medical staff) While at their house helping with care, my father's wife then argued with me about stopping him from going and it was MY fault and she was ""number 1"". The argument included her asking me if I wanted my father to die and ordering me out of her house (and threatening to call the police if I do not leave.) Shocked beyond measure I left.

Not too long after that he was admitted to the facility for a few weeks. He came home permanently after that. I then brought my wife over to sort of mediate a discussion between us, but that did not accomplish anything. I went back to my father's room and said goodbye. (Secretly I was saying goodbye to him for a long while and maybe even the last time.) I ghosted her right after that. No contact."
258,"Ask if he wants to take a shower together, start kissing him on his stomach while cuddling, stroke him on his V when he's doing the dishes, caress his lower back while cuddling, straight up ask him, touch the d, stroke his inner thighs, etc etc. "
259,"As someone that's in a relationship with someone that is generally of a similar mindset, what are your feelings on non-sexually physical intimacy between partners in a committed relationship?  For example:
1) kissing when not having sex or foreplay
2) hugging when not in foreplay
3) holding hands in public
4) general physical contact when sitting together on the sofa watching TV.

I ask these because my partner has essentially told me that she views anyone that desires that their partner kiss them, hug them, or even say that they love them from time to time is just wanting their ego stroked and that she isn't here to stroke anyone's ego and doesn't want her's stroked either.  In general, with rare exception, the only physical contact we have is when she puts her legs across my lap and tells me to rub her feet.

I'm trying to feel out if this is just a dead relationship, or if she just has a really different approach to physical intimacy than I do."
260,"I try to think of this like people and snakes. I like snakes, I don't find them creepy, but I know many others do. I'll try to explain and demonstrate why I think they're cute or pretty, acknowledge that some are maybe less appealing to people, ask the person how they'd interacted with one before, and if they'd like to try again. But I don't laugh at them, or make them feel dumb, or just push a snake at them intrusively or persistently. Attempting to challenge someone's boundaries or comforts is a teaching/training exercise if it's even desired at all. You can't just expect them to go 0-100 and outright shame them about their feelings, because you're just gonna make them feel crappy and see you as an asshole. Tough love has a place/time."
261,"That's a hard one, without knowing her or her background / mannerisms very well.

Personally I'm ok with physical affection within a relationship or with people you've established intimacy with. It DOES take probably more time to get to a certain level, or won't be as common, or will have certain things generally off-limits. PDA, for people who are more private or already not generally physical, can be a very gradual bridge to cross, again with limits.

But expressing affection physically (in one way or another) is very powerful and connecting, and if one partner needs a certain type of level of it, there needs to be a thoughtful and empathic conversation around respecting the needs AND boundaries of BOTH partners - Is she / can she compromise or work on giving you more? Does she acknowledge that there's a rift between you? How much can you be without, or is there a deal-breaker limit? Is it something she can / should / wants to work on?

Her basically saying she believes expressions of affection always have selfish alternative motives with no positive side makes me wonder if she's had dishonest people in her life, has experienced or seen unfaithfulness in what were very ""lovey-dovey"" relationships, or has insecurities / trust issues / reflexively keeps protective walls around herself and her connections with others. Those scenarios need to be approached carefully to avoid just accusing and putting her on the defensive. But I do think you should make clear to her that you don't ""need your ego stroked"", but do need to understand what her ""love language"" is (perhaps she doesn't even know? try both taking a simple quiz online), and for her to respect yours."
262,"Brute force and ignorance.

I bought some pens (if you’re a lefty, make sure to get either straight nibs, or ones slanted for lefties; most stores only sell right slanted ones so you might have to special order them), and I downloaded a few sheets of practise strokes from the internet. Then I just did the strokes over and over and over and over and over while listening to the TV.

Eventually I bought Marc Drogin’s book on medieval calligraphy (shhh! Some purists don’t like this one! But it was fine for me), and started practising the variations."
263,"Well for her shes absolutely fantastic in bed and with blowjobs she has amazing enthusiasm and is great with her mouth.  With her hands she sometimes doesn't grab and stroke the right part.  She strokes too close to the base of the shaft. Then if i move her hand to the right part (higher up on the shaft, closer to the head) she strokes it a little too fast.  I'm thinking about saying something about it but don't wanna fuck up her confidence. Any ideas? "
264,"Ha, I used to do this too. Really, there's no harm in giving a sexy demo in how you like to be stroked, or putting your hand over hers to guide her. 

If you don't want to hurt her confidence, use positive reinforcement or instructions instead of criticisms!  For example, you could say, ""Could you try...?"" and guide her hand, then go, ""Fuck yes, stroke me like that"" when she tries it. If she does go too fast again, maybe say a simple ""Slow, baby,"" instead."
265,"I had a medication that gave me ocular migraines as a side effect. Pepcid of all things. It's a really common otc med and apparently I'm like one in a million, but there we are.

[This is the best visualization I've seen of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8P_ZTJqv8g) it's pretty spot on though mine took up a much larger field of view after about half an hour and lasted for a really long time. A few hours at least. 

Terrifying the first few times it happened- wasn't able to drive home. Had to have someone pick me up from work. After a couple times they got kind of entertaining. I never had pain or nausea associated with it though I have gotten other migraines for years that certainly do- just no visuals. So I'd be at work and be like ""it's starting again"" and kinda play with my blind spot until someone picked me up to go home (I could not work without being able to see and it would last several hours). They stopped a few days after I stopped taking pepcid. Haven't gotten em since. 

I really feel for people who have them on a regular basis. It's no joke. I was effectively blind. Combine that with the common pain symptoms after and fuck that noise. Either is shit enough on it's own. Both is just the universe poopin' on your face. "
266,"Only once. It was my worst one to date. I didn't realize it was an aura at the time. It was like there was a white spot in my right eye that wouldn't go away. I thought it was just my eyes or brain bugging out because I was in a white room looking at white papers at the time. Then the pain started. I eventually drove myself home, threw up from the nausea, and laid in bed crying from the pain until I was finally able to pass out."
267,"I lose vision in my peripherals and if I don't take some Advil extra strength asap, I will get  nauseous and likely pass out. I don't ever get any other symptoms of a migraine because it goes straight from aura to passing out. Usually caused by low blood pressure because I forgot to eat, or staring at a screen too long (both go hand in hand for me since I work at a computer and often forget to eat while doing so)."
268,"Yeah for me migraine is usually just the aura, with a bit of a headache.

Sometimes my first sign will be that I am squinting and straining to see my work in a way I usually don’t. 

Then it will start as a little blurry patch with distorted colours, that looks a bit like when you get a drop of water on your phone screen. This gradually expands and slides down my vision. Eventually a good portion of my vision will be obscured. 

I can get around but not see details. Trying too hard to focus and get stuff done during this time can start/worsen a headache and sometimes make me feel a little nauseous. It’s a real nuisance.

Takes about 2 hours from first hint of blurryness to it passing."
269,"I had this only one time, when I was pregnant. I had no idea what was going on. I just had this spot in my vision that was very persistent and wouldn't go away. I know this sounds crazy, but I was starting to think someone had slipped me acid in my food or something and I was starting to get really bad anxiety about it. Then the headache hit and I did some googling and realized it was just a migraine. It has never happened since, but wow that was a weird and horrible experience."
270,"I've had three aura migraines in my life. They were by far the worst I've ever felt. I realised the trigger was dehydration and running on a hot day (all were shortly after track practice ended in the summer) so I just drank more water.

When the aura first starts it just seems like a spot in my vision, primarily on my right side. I could still see it with my left eye if I covered up my right, and things behind it were able to be seen, but not clearly. Like when you glance at a bright light for a moment and for the next few seconds you have a blind spot in your vision. But the spot grew bigger and bigger over time and seemed to look like static on a television if I concentrated on it, and formed a backwards C. Eventually the C would grow bigger and bigger until I couldn't see it anymore, as if it had passed by me of it were physically real. Once it disappeared from my vision, the migraine hit. I had intense pain from my neck to my forehead, pounding, throbbing and sharp. I felt dizzy, nauseous and weak. Once I saw the aura I had about 40 minutes to get to an appropriate place for the migraine to hit, and all I could really do was wait it out.

It sucked so hard. And when I figured out I just had to drink more water I smacked myself in the forehead like ""could I be so stupid? That's it?"" Thank God that was it.  "
271,"Yes, since the age of 13. Mine start with a dot like you get after a camera flash, then slowly go from one side of my eyes to the other. At first, it’s small, then it gets bigger with each pass and it is shaped like a zig-zagged greater than/less than sign. Where ever it is, I can’t see, so I have a blind spot- it can last from 15 minutes up to an hour depending on circumstances. When they get to their largest and disappear, most times that’s when the pain hits, like a sledgehammer- I’ve had it knock me to my knees and start throwing up wherever I’m standing. 

On the worst ones, my arm and face tingle and go numb and I slur my words or I think correctly but what I say doesn’t come out right. 

Now they call them hemiplegic migraines. 

When I was 22, I had a full on stroke due to taking birth control pills and the severity of my migraines. I lost the use of my right side and had to do a lot of therapy to get it back and speak again. 

I tell everyone I know to not take birth control if they have migraines.

 Barometric pressure is a big one for me, stress, msg and I am very light, sound and smell sensitive. I use a thing called f.lux on my comp to adjust the light because I can see the fluctuations on the white patterns and it drives me batty. I put it to “candlelight” on all times so I don’t have the brightness to deal with."
272,"I get them a lot. 

I get light sensitivity and an absent ringing in my ears (like the sensation of ringing, but without the sound... it’s hard to explain). Then it starts with slight pressure, like I tied a ponytail too tight. Then it escalates to a full on headache then a migraine. 

My migraines are scary though. The worst has stroke-like symptoms. They thought I might be having TIAs but that got ruled out. I get vision problems, tingling on one side, speech problems (though it’s due to the pain and I can fight through it if I try), all while having the actual migraine headache. "
273,"Yes, I've gotten them periodically throughout my life since childhood. 

I get something called a [scintillating scotoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillating_scotoma) that completely obstructs a good portion of my vision to the point where I can't see certain things. It's like having an obstructive object in my way and can't see the things behind it. You know that bright light you get in your eyes when you look at the sun for too long, but it eventually goes away? It's like that, but it doesn't diminish after a minute or two...it stays for the duration of the migraine. 

I also get pretty bad expressive aphasia. When I was 8, I remember my mom taking me to the ER for these migraines (she thought I was having a stroke...which they present similarly to), and my mom kept asking me all kinds of questions and wouldn't leave me alone. Instead of wanting to communicate to her, ""Mom, can you please be quiet"" the words that came out of my mouth were, ""Mom, why are you so bald?"". I had the thought in my head that I wanted to say, however completely different message comes out. It's a very frustrating and powerless feeling tbh. Sometimes it gets as bad as a jumbled up word salad. [This]( https://youtu.be/AVKDm4PhEwI) is actually a perfect example of what happens to me. 


The next strange symptom I get is this approximately 2x2 square patch of numbness that arises at my finger tips of one hand, and slowly rises up my arm (but only in the 2x2 patch..I regain sensation again to the places where the square patch started out after it migrates upward) until it hits that shoulder of the arm it started out on. Then, it will cross over to the opposite shoulder and make its way down to my fingertips, to which it stops completely once it's there. Very weird shit. 

Lastly, and probably the weirdest thing for people to understand, is that I don't get a headache with my migraines...like, at all. No nausea either. 

They're debilitating for me though, because I can't function properly even though they don't cause me pain. I can't communicate, see, and am generally not pleasant to be around when I have one. I'm lucky that if I catch it when it's starting early some extra strength advil is enough to stop it in its tracks. However, if I wait till it progresses I'm screwed and am completely useless for like 6 hours until it goes away on its own. I hate them, because they've stopped me from being able to safely take estrogen based oral contraceptives (which is like 99% of them). Thank goodness they're not very common for me though...*knocks on wood*.

Edit: Another common term for my type of migraine with aura is a hemiplegic migraine. "
274,"Yes. It wasn't painful until the aura went away, then it was nausea and the worst pain with no way to stop it. This happened 2 times a week and went on for months. I finally told my Dr who realized I was having a bad reaction to the BC pill Azurette. She pulled me of it right away because this aura migraines were a sign I would soon have a stroke. The migraines stopped as soon as I stopped taking the pills. "
275,"This is why estrogen based oral contraceptives are black box contraindicated. If you've had an aura migraine, even once, and take estrogen based birth control then your chances of having a stroke from the birth control (normally an incredibly rare side effect) hike up quite a bit."
276,"Yes, it's truly horrible. I commend you for staying calm and just googling, I ran straight to the doctor in horror. I had some other symptoms though, like a stroke."
277,"I'm sorry you had to experience this. Have you recovered completely? I read online that migraines with aura are connected to a higher risk for strokes. I think it's great that you warn others of the dangers of the pill. It's important that more women know that the pill is not harmless as it's made out to be. 

I use f.lux as well, it's much better on the eyes."
278,"They are terrifying. I mentioned it to my eye doctor and he immediately said that all his patients said how horrible it was. If you don't know what's happening, it's like a stroke.

Interesting, I never had any symptoms before I got my migraine attacks. They were caused by the pill, so they only ever came about during the one week when I stopped taking them. Maybe that's why I didn't have symptoms before. I had only two migraines with aura so far, all the other ones were ""just"" headache migraines.

Yes, headaches are a very nasty kind of pain. "
279,"I never heard of such a reaction to peanuts, but it doesn't seem that unlikely to me. 

Did you know that there is a theory that peanut allergies are actually a reaction to a very high amount of aflatoxines (mold) that is present in bad peanuts? It's a bit obscure and I only read it in passing, but I found it interesting."
280,It was weekly when I switched to Sprintec. Looked up symptoms online. Saw the word “stroke.” Panicked and called my doctor. My cousin had a stroke at 25 and they believe it was her birth control. Not happening to me.
281,"It really is. The only way I can get rid of them is to lie down in a dark, quiet room and pass out for a little while. OTC pain medications don't even touch it. Luckily I don't get them that often anymore."
282,"Yes, that's also what my family said. I went to the doctor the same day I had it and he immediately sent me to the hospital. Well, a stroke at 25 is extremely early, that's certainly something to be aware of. 

What is Sprintec? "
283,"Sit on my butt and recover. I worked my tushie off a few days ago in my yard. 9AM to 3PM. For a lot of things, there is no setting between Off and On and I got a bit heat stroked and made it worse by not stopping till I was done.

So..plans for the day? Sit."
284,"I do and I really hate things like *stroke* are talked like as if it's nothing because it doesn't happen to most women who are on BC. It happens to zero woman who uses condoms.

Most women in my life tried BC at one point. EVERY one of them experienced at least one side effect, waited to get to use it, around 7 out of 10 of them didn't and stopped using it."
285,">. It happens to zero woman who uses condoms.

Uh, are you saying stroke is not considered a potential side effect of condoms? Because whilst that's true, you can definitely have a stroke outside of being on the pill. 


The risk for stroke in pregnancy is between 10-18 per 100 000 [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3137888/). The risk for stroke on the pill is 8 per 100 000 [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2634299/). Therefore, if you use condoms and they fail you have a greater risk of stroke than if you were on the pill."
286,"I meant condoms don’t have a side effect like stroke, obviously. Also the pill can fail too."
287,"Sure the pill can fail, but it's perfect use and typical use failure rate is significantly better than condoms. 

Unless you have a family history, migraines or you smoke, then your risk of stroke is essentially 'nothing'. "
288,"But it’s not nothing. My friend’s mother had a stroke, yes, but years after her daughter was on BC pills.  There are people who get misdiagnosed about the type of headache they have, etc. So they’re not even aware they’re actually in the “Unless...” group. And then there are other side effects. I get it’s the best option for some, everyone’s own choice anyway but re: the OP, I don’t think the side effects of BC are reported or talked enough."
289,">But it’s not nothing

At a risk of 0.00008% for most people it's negligible. Having a stroke is a tragedy, but for the vast majority of people stroke risk from the pill is negligible. Especially when you consider the rate of overall stroke is 545/100 000 [source]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4125206/). 

Do you warn women about getting pregnant because of the increased risk of stroke?"
290,"I lost my dad two weeks ago due to complications from a stroke. Here are the things I wish I had told him, or asked him (he couldn't speak due to a tracheotomy in his last few weeks):

* His favourite story from my childhood

* His favourite recipe, meal, dessert etc

* Places he would have liked to travel 

* Favourite place he travelled in the past 

* Favourite girl and boy names 

* Told him how much I loved him, how thankful I've always been to have him as my dad and that I hope one day I can be as good a person as he was. How deeply I wished I could have taken his pain away. 

* Ask if they would like to have a specific song played at the funeral. 

* Take pictures of him and with him. Record him saying I love you. Record him telling a story.

* Favourite book, film, song etc

Some of these things you might already know about your mum. I never asked if he wanted certain things at his funeral because his death was pretty unexpected. I told him I loved him when I visited him in the hospital, but I never told him I was thankful and so proud to be his daughter because I didn't want him to think I thought he would die. Now I wish I had somehow expressed my deep love and gratitude more clearly. 

I wish you and your family the best. 

Edit: Ask your mother what her wishes are regarding her remains: does she want to get buried or cremated etc. It was difficult for me thinking there's only ashes left of my dad but that's what he wanted. "
291,"I lost my mum this past summer.  Seeing as I am thinking about possibly having kids in the future I wish I had asked her about what it was like for her during her pregnancy. What are some of her favorite times with me as I was growing up. I found an old photo album of hers after she passed and I'm lucky because she kept lots of notes with the pics but I would've liked to just know more about her before she was a mum. Sometimes we forget our parents had lives before us and I would like to know that person, the young lady with a lead foot, the girl who was engaged before my dad stole her away.....
Enjoy your time, I sang silly songs and cracked jokes and did her nails. I enjoyed all of it and the reality of her being gone hasn't quite set in yet. If you need to talk or vent I'm here."
292,"[You should consider getting a guided book to write her life story.](http://www.amazon.com/Mothers-Legacy-Your-Story-Words/dp/1404113339/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1433936124&sr=8-2&keywords=write+your+own+life+story+book) This one has 12 questions a month over a year, but you can go through it together and work on the most important ones first.  Then, slowly work on the rest if you have time.  My mother passed away when I was young and I would really cherish something like this had she written it.  "
293,"Coming from a banker's aspect here.  If she can, try to take her to all the banks where her assets are kept.  Get to know a representative while adding yourself to all (ALL) her accounts.  Even if your father or someone else is a joint signer on the accounts, I'd still get yourself on them.  Get the information for all the important (non-family) members in her life and make sure they know about what's going on as well: the accountant, the family attorney, even doctors, etc., should all know who you are.  Due to confidentiality and legality reasons, it's easier to do things while a person is still alive and becomes a whole lot more complicated and labor-intensive after date of deceased.  

Basically, if an account only has your mother's name on it after she's passed, it almost always *has* to go to an estate account, which requires additional documentation and usually done through the courts.  However, for accounts that are Joint With Right of Survivor(ship) (JWRS), you simply walk in with a death certificate and say you want to remove your mother's name from the account and that's it.  

Please, let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.  

Best of luck to you, my prayers are with you and your family."
294,"Hey there OP. 

I truly feel for what you and your family are going through. My Mom passed away when I was 14, breast cancer. I'm 21 now, and when I think about my future, I can't help but grieve that it won't involve my Mom. 

I would have loved for my Mom to write me letters that I could open with advice during major events in my life- high school and college graduation, first heartbreak, engagement, wedding day, first born, etc. 

Something else to consider: when my Mom passed away my Dad got a copy of her index fingerprint from the hospital and then had it put on a necklaces for me and my siblings. I wear the necklace everyday and run my finger over it whenever I'm missing her. 

Feel free to PM me anytime if you want to talk more. "
295,"All of the suggestions here have been wonderful, and I don't believe my mine will add much.  

I would suggest that you continue to just be present.  There really isn't anything to do when loved ones are in the process of leaving us but be there with them.  Dying, of course, is not something to be avoided but another part of life to be cherished.  It is as important as giving birth, a first kiss, marriage, having children, and seeing them grow.   Your being present in the moment will help your mother to also be present.  Your fearlessness will provide comfort and help her to pass in serenity.  Sometimes the dying are worried about being a burden.  Try to enjoy these moments so that she too enjoys them.  "
296,"Sorry to hear about what you are going through.  I would record her- ask her questions about her family, what it was like growing up.  There is a really great book (sorry I'm at work and don't have it handy) that we used with my great grandmother.  We just recorded us chatting with her, asking her these questions, like a normal conversation.  20 years later, it's awesome to have those tapes of her talking about her childhood and talking about her life and her family and the world.  

Love is always a great topic.  Ask her to talk about how her and your father met (even if you already know the story, have her tell you again).  Ask things like how it made her feel.  Ask what are some funny things they did together.  Ask what her advice would be if you were getting married or having kids or whatever you have left in life that she won't be there to experience that you want to accomplish.  

If you aren't able to video record, at least record her voice speaking with you.  

When I was very little, I had gotten a tape recorder for Christmas and I was recording Christmas at my grandparents.  I found the tape about 10 years later and listened to it.  By this point my grandpa had unexpectedly passed away.  The tape was pretty ""normal"" just all of my cousins and everyone talking through the day- us being kids.  Then it got to the end of the tape- the very last thing before the tape ended was our family leaving for the day and my grandpa's voice saying, ""mablesyrup, come over here and give me a kiss and a hug goodbye"".  I cried for days.  "
297,"I think a lot of people are forgetting the most important thing. I would love to ask my mom millions of questions, but most of all I would tell my mom how much I love her and cherish the time with her. I knew my mom would pass, but I never thought it would be real. My mom had a really slow decline and passed the day day before Thanksgiving this past year. Just cherish your mom OP and have light hearted conversation with her and make a memory. "
298,"Record her voice. It's been said before, but record it. Record her saying how much she loves you, saying things like happy birthday and Merry Christmas, and copy it to the point where you have dozens of copies in the house. 

Ask her about her most favorite moment with you when you were a baby, then ask about her most frightening moment. 

Ask her what she regrets. Chances are, she regrets something with you or in her life you can fulfill or tell her she doesn't need to regret, because you are okay. 

Hug her. Oh my gosh, hug her tight and try to memorize her body heat. Her kiss on your cheek. Try to remember her smells. They'll fade with time unless you box specific things away for safe keeping. And even then, the memory of her warmth will fade unless you have an excellent memory. 

Video her, if you want to remember her in her current state. My biggest regret with my Mother's passing was that I always listened to her complaints of hating being on camera, and recorded other people in the room instead. Now I watch those videos wishing I had turned the camera just a little, just enough to catch her in it. 

"
299,"Family history.

Several months before my grandmother passed, my uncle hauled out his video camera and the family photo albums and recorded her going through them stating who was in the photo and, if she knew, the story behind the photo. For the most part, that is the only family history I have. While I knew some of it back then (1985) time has taken a toll on those memories.

We tried to do the same with my mother when her health started declining. She refused because she believed that we thought she would soon die (she was present when my uncle taped their mother). Her body was failing, not her mind at that time. Long story short, she remained in relatively decent health for several more years before having a stroke. Sadly, with the exception of the eldest, the only memories her grandchildren will have of her is a woman who was sick and could barely speak. If she had let us record when we asked, they would see the strong woman she was. Not to mention they will not know who many of the people are in the photos from almost a 100 years ago because we aren't sure (by time I got interested in family history there weren't many left to ask).

God knows how much family history has been lost/forgotten."
300,"Record all the stories. My mom, aunts, and uncles always tell these great stories whenever they get together about their childhoods, their parents, their dog, their school, old flames, cross-country road trips, crazy great-aunts that passed long ago, etc, etc. Also some old family histories about my grandmother's family in Northern Ireland and my grandfather's family adventures in Atlantic City during Prohibition. They always talk about writing it all down, but they never do. I'm currently trying to record some of them with my mom, we'll see how it goes! Spoken stories get filtered and changed and lost with each passing generation, it's so great to preserve them for the future."
301,"""Are you proud of me? Did I make the right choice/s? How can I honor you when you're gone?""

Lost my mother to a combination of cancer/stroke. I feel for you. Feel free to PM me if you need to talk to someone who gets it. "
302,"In addition to all the other lovely suggestions,

- Record her laugh.  Either just audio, or if you're both comfortable with a camera, a video.  I miss the way my grandma's eyes sparkled just like a little girl when she laughed.

- Ask for a letter or recording of why she's proud of you.  Something to give encouragement to get you through the hard times in life.

- If there are grandkids, ask for advice for them.  How to know they've chosen the right husband or wife, the right career, and other issues that you've already passed but they have yet to face."
303,"My mom passed away last summer, and I think constantly about what I should have asked and said.  I'm in my late twenties and dating is a weird thing - I wish I had asked her more about her relationships, both with my Dad and before him.  What made her swoon, what drove her away, what did she look for and what did she put up with?  I wish I had asked her about how sad she was when her Grandma died or when her Dad killed himself.  I was there for both, but she just put on such a brave front for my brother & I that I have no idea what her grief was like or how she learned to cope.  That would help me so much now.  And I'd ask what she wanted to know from me.  I'd answer any question with open honesty.  "
304,"This might be something you haven't thought of, but make sure she writes down all of her online accounts and passwords. Passwords for her ATM and to login to her computers and cellphone. Passwords for websites for her banks, credit cards, utilities, insurance, social media, email, etc. Ask for answers to common security questions for those websites.

This will make finding important documents and information 1000x easier, especially if she doesn't have someone around her who knows this information already."
305,"I definitely agree with everyone mentioning recording her telling stories but there are other things too. 

Account numbers, documents, online passwords, pin numbers. You'll need all of that later to get her affairs sorted once she's gone. "
306,"I'm sorry to hear about your mother. My dad passed away almost two years ago and I wish I knew more details about him. My family isn't big about talking. I bought my mother a memory book like you do for babies growing up and it asks those question you want to know about adults. I hope everyday she fills it out because I feel like I don't know crap about my mother which is upsetting. 

Write down questions you want to know personal, intimate and important stuff like financial things for when she passes. I would just ask and see what type of response she has. "
307,"My mom passed away from cancer last year and she declined too quickly for me to ask much. I am so sorry that you have to go through this - it's...I don't have a lot of words for what it's like. You know.

My husband and I were thinking about starting a family when she started declining, so for me, I wanted to have as much information about her for me and so I could have something to share about her with my future child. I bought a book similar to [this](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/all-about-my-grandmother-alex-a-lluch/1016203918?r=1&ean=9781934386606&kpid=9781934386606&cm_mmc=GooglePLA-_-Book_Under5-_-Q000000633-_-9781934386606) and that really helped to lead the conversation and can give you specific ideas on questions to ask. You can write down the answers or better yet record them so you can hear them in her voice. Unfortunately, I did this too late. I thought I had more time, but she was too weak and couldn't answer much.

My mom hated having video taken or her picture taken while she was sick because she didn't want to be remembered as a cancer patient, but we got a video of her on the last day she was really lucid. We took her outside and had lunch and she was smiling. I watch it all the time and she's right, I wish I had some video of her where she looked like the woman I remember and not my mom with cancer. That said...I'll cherish that video forever.

Along with that video, the only other recording I have of her voice is her voicemail message. My husband was able to get that off of her cell phone after she passed away for all of us.

A big help was my aunt. She made me a photo album of my mom when she was younger and I always have it nearby. Ask around for photos from your family members because they may have some that you've never seen.

In the present - just make sure you're there with her as much as possible. I gave my mom a little manicure and painted her nails while she was in bed. She always liked to have polish on her nails.

If you don't know already, you may want to ask her what she wants after she passes away. My mom and dad had talked about it and she definitely wanted to be cremated, but when I was talking with her alone out of the blue she mentioned that she wanted to be cremated in her wedding dress - something she hadn't told my dad before.

We didn't have a full funeral for her because she didn't want one. So it was just our family at the funeral home. They dressed her in her wedding dress just like she asked and we had a private room with her where we all just cried and shared special memories we had with her. 

Be there for your dad - losing a parent is a lot different than losing your spouse and he will be grieving in a completely different way.

Good luck with everything, feel free to PM if you need someone to talk to or not talk to."
308,"My dad had a stroke a year or so ago, and thinking about his mortality, I bought this book called All About Me by Philipp Keel. I ask my dad the questions, and write the answers in the book.  I highly recommend it.  Hugs."
309,"Ask about family health history and your own health history as a child. This probably varies from family to family, but I do not know a lot about my own health history as a child and neither of my parents is a reliable narrator for various reasons. SO. MANY. TIMES. since my grandma and my cousin, who babysat me a lot, have passed away, I have wished I had asked them this stuff. I have, for example, a drug that I am apparently allergic to but I have no idea what happens if it is given to me. If I ask my mom, she just giggles and says she doesn't remember. My grandma and cousin could have told me. I'm guessing your mom is willing and able to answer these types of questions, so you may want to ask them now while you still can."
310,"If she'll let you, try to record her talking to you. Even if all it does is preserve less-than-stellar memories of her post-stroke and with cancer, it's something. I wish I have a video of my mom talking or laughing, even though by the end of her time with MS, she was nothing like the woman I knew when I was little.

I wish I had more childhood stories. I only have a few, and what little my dad can remember. To be honest, I don't know a whole lot about the person my mom was, because she got sick when I was very young, so she was always just ""Mom, sick"" to me. In a way, that's kind of nice, because I can tell myself she was perfect. If you don't want to kid yourself, find out what she believes, what she thinks about. Plans she had for you. How she felt or what she thought about the first time she held you. "
311,"Do you have children? Get a journal & ask for family recipes, or her favorite recipes.. how to get a stain out of carpet, advice for how to handle moody teenagers. Think of when you'd call her would it be for a dinner recipe or to ask what she would do in a situation? Write it all down. My grandfather passed away last month, he was like my father. Im so glad I knew it was coming & could ask him what his favorite songs were, his favorite movies. Food was our ""thing"" he took me to sushi before i was 2, when i was 7 we had our first thia food lunch date. Chinese was our regular, when he was in the hospital after a heart attack i actually had a chinese restaurant deliver to us in the hospital so he would eat something. Sorry! looks like I've gone on rambling. 
In addition to asking questions about her ask about parenting advice (if thats relevant) ask if theres something she wished she had done that you should definitely do. And write it all down!! "
312,"Ask her about her life. Her memories. Her parents, and grandparents, and the rest of her family. About the jobs she had, the places she went, her memories of your and your siblings that you might not know about. Ask her what you were like as a kid. Ask her what she loves and what makes her happy. Bring her those things where you can.

Ask her about her health history too - you will want to know about this.

Ask her about what she wants for her funeral, does she want to be an organ donor, does she want to be buried, where? Ask her what she wants done with her things. Make sure she updated her will. 

Help her record her memories. Write a book, record a story. Help her write a journal.

I'm sorry you have to go through this, and I'm touched by this question. My Dad had a stroke too."
313,"My mom passed away a year ago from cancer. She always told me about family and family history and everything about her side. I'm bad at remembering verbal stories and would give anything to have written everything down.

Ask your mom about your family history, about cousins and aunts and uncles. Anybody you need to remember to invite to a wedding for example. This also includes anything concerning illness, heart disease, cancer (if it is genetic for example).

In the same vein, if she has breast or ovarian cancer, ask if she could be tested for the BRCA mutation. Trust me, it'll take a load off your back if she comes out negative. If positive, you'll be more prepared in the future.

Ask about any valuables, antiques, heirlooms, jewelry that're important to her.

Ask about stories from your childhood, fond memories, things that'd make her smile.

Above all, just spend time with her and show your unconditional love for her. She needs it now more than ever. "
314,"I was in the exact same situation with my mom and here are some things that mean a lot to her and me:

- We did recordings of her singing the nursery rhymes and her favorite songs.  
- I made recording of her telling me about her childhood.  I hope to make these stories into a book one day.
- I have a recording of her singing happy birthday to me.
- She had me write personal letters to all my brothers and sisters with her memories of them when they were little and her hopes for them in the future.
- She taught me all the recipes she was known for.  We did this over a baby monitor I set up between her room and the kitchen.  I wrote everything down and practiced each dish with her telling me all the nuances.  This ended up being wonderful because it gave her purpose although she couldn't get out of bed.


Mainly, the things that meant the most during that time were making her feel needed and useful even though she couldn't get out the bed.  I let her call the shots and make the decisions as long as she could.  For example, I took pictures of her garden and let her tell me what to do.  She loved couponing, so I would help her clip and sort coupons.  She wanted to buy birthday gifts for the grandchildren so I went online shopping and ordered things she wanted to get and showed her the pictures.

I hope this is helpful to you.  The period right before my mom passed away were sad, but I got to know my mom on a level that I would not have been able to otherwise."
315,"One of my prized possessions is a collection of recordings I made of my mom telling her memories before she passed away.

**ABSOLUTELY DO THIS** "
316,"My step-father passed away unexpectedly this winter.  When I was driving along in his truck one day about a month later, I noticed a recording device on his sunvisor.  
I pressed the button to see what jems he had recorded.
I damn near drove off the road when I heard him say ""Heya sweetheart, I still love you!"" (ostensibily to my Mom, but we all hear his love in that sentence).
I recorded it on my phone, emailed it around to the fam (to keep copies everywhere) and then waited for a good moment to play it for my Mom.
She now has a permanent recording of one of the sweetest sentences ever.

"
317,"I highly recommend this!!

Before my grandmother passed away, maybe 6 months before, I was able to record a short candid video of her telling an anecdote to my husband. Sometimes I watch it just to hear her voice and see her smile.

My father died when I was young (10 years old) and some of my most cherished possessions are the family movies that I have. He was behind the camera in all of them, so I can't see him, but I can hear his voice and sometimes that's all I need."
318,And account number and online passwords you might need. Dealing with utilities can be hard without account numbers.
319,"My grandma raised me, and passed away in 2011.  She haaated the camera, so we have very few good pictures or videos of her.  I have some snippets here and there with her in them, and I treasure those little bits.  "
320,"I'm making a cookbook filled with handwritten recipes to eventually pass on. I wish my grandma and my mom had something like that for me, but I'll just have to take those random pieces of paper and put them together myself. "
321,"I know that feeling, every once in a blue moon at work I get a phone call from someone who sounds just like my dad (who passed away 7 years ago) and it's always so surreal. Definitely shakes me up a bit."
322,"Agreed, audio recorders *were* around... however they weren't integrated into everyday use like cellphone photos and videos are today.  

Since my mom died suddenly of heart attack at an early age (64)... I never thought to grab the old dictaphone from my office to record her.  But I sure wish I had.
"
323,"I'd really like a way to make my mom's life easier. She has a gene mutation that causes her to have strokes. She had her first stroke in her twenties. There isn't a whole lot of information on her gene mutation and the problems that come with it, but someday I hope there is a cure for it or a way to prevent another person from having strokes starting in their twenties due to this mutation. "
324,"to learn something by self taught, you need passion, ambition and love in what you want to learn

it's easy to work with something you love with passion for a day and can stay all nighter for it if necessary, you will enjoy practice the same thing and you will learn it by experience

if you hate it, quit"
325,"Start small and/or simple and be consistent. Gradually work your way up. Search around the web for tips or different perspectives on doing the hobby/skill. 

If there are videos demonstrating the hobby (like crochet), watch them regularly so doing things yourself can eventually come easily. 
"
326,"That is a great thing to pick up and yes that sub is super supportive and helpful.  Start small.  Get yourself some good lines paper and just start with one stroke (down stroke is a great starting point).  Learn how to do one style of down stroke until you have it pretty well down.  This will help you learn  things like how much pressure to use, speed, and smoothness of movement as well as angle and size and all that stuff.  Then work on another stroke and add them together...  Once you have a few strokes down pretty well start learning an entire alphabet one letter at a time.  Just liek when you first learned to write.  You don't need any major investment to start.  Lined paper and even a remotely decent pen (of which there are recommendations on the sub) are all you need to start.  So don't worry about messing up a few ( even a few dozen) lines.  Go slow and just one step at a time.  You'll get the hang of it. !!! "
327,"I’m going to go with what my oldest said when meeting her baby sister (she was freshly 4 then). “Wow mommy, you make pretty babies.” It was funny and adorable, especially when she gave this big grin, knowing full well that she was included in that remark. I’ll take pride in that statement any day! 

And a second, much sadder but still sweet one. My best four legged friend of 11 years got ill very suddenly over the course of a week. By the time the vet got him in, my dog was in full kidney and liver failure. My daughter stayed right next to me all weekend, holding and stroking him, then hugging and stroking me too. He ended up passing away with him in my lap at home, my four year old leaning on my back to hug me. I was 8.5 months pregnant at the time, and I was just plain broken for weeks over it. Any time I’d start crying randomly, she’d stop what she was doing (even in other rooms), find me, hug me, and say different variations of “he loved you lots and you’ll see him again. we can have dreams of Strudel together!”.  She was incredibly understanding and strong during it, considering her age. She’s 5.5 now and still requests to hold the plaster of his paw print before bed sometimes so she “can dream of him”.

Gah, I’m choking up now thinking about it."
328,I would let it grow and grow like I do with my hair. And I would stroke it while thinking.
329,"Stroke it thoughtfully, all the time."
330,"Massage it, stroke it thoughtfully, grow it long and have a warm face all the time. "
331,"Stroke it while thinking.

Otherwise, I think it'd be cool to have a shorter goatee type beard that was dyed some cool color (blue or purple probably)."
332,Stroke it. Wax my moustache to look like Poirot. 
333,"[Let me share with you my secret.](http://www.dorcousa.com/)

Their razors are super cheap and super good quality, and the cartridges last forever. I changed my last one in November and it's still sharp. No nicks. Their sales are insane too, especially around the holiday season. I bought enough razors and cartridges to last me a year for like $10 on there. 

That said: ankle to knee, rinse under running water, repeat. I rinse after every stroke."
334,"**Stroke:** Long strokes, Ankle to knee, and then knee to 1/3 up my thigh.

**Razor:** Gillette Venus

**Shave gel:** I just use soap lather usually, otherwise some conditioner.

**Rinse:** I just hold it under the shower stream every 3-4 strokes.

**Place:** I shave in the shower. Standing up for legs and pits and sitting down for minge.

**Nicks/cuts:** Rarely if ever."
335,"I use cheap disposable men's razors (currently Meijer brand, but I also really like Riteaid's) and that liquid Olay soap that has a bunch of lotion in it (it's seriously about the consistency of shaving lotion, has a really good, thick lather, and doesn't dry out my skin - and it's a big bottle for a couple bucks).  I sit on the side of the tub with the faucet at a drizzle to rinse the razor and a big jug of water to rinse my legs with (that I refill a couple times).  I use several short strokes, shaving ankle to mid thigh (I don't have much hair past there, though).  I rinse the blades every few strokes (or everybstroke if I haven't shaved in three months).  My legs usually take maybe 5 minutes each."
336,"I have really sensitive skin and find these things to be helpful! 

*If in a shower, make sure to let it get really steamy and soften the skin first. 

*If in a bath, then letting the area that I want to shave soak for a little while first to soften the skin. 

*Exfoliate first! I buy a jar of an exfoliating scrub to use on the skin I want to shave first to loosen the hair follicle and get rid of any dead skin. St. Ives Apricot Scrub is great. :) 

*Invest in a good shave cream/gel/lotion. I love the EOS brand shave lotion. It's excellent, lathers well and the Raspberry Pomegranate one smells so good. I've heard a lot of good things about Skintimate shave gel too, and I'm trying it out to see, but I love love love the EOS one! 

*Razor - nothing too fancy but definitely something that pivots and has conditioning strips and a couple of blades.

*Stroke from ankle to knee, and rinse after each stroke. "
337,"I shave in the shower. Shave days also usually coincide with co-wash days, so instead of shaving cream I use conditioner. Technique wise... I do long strokes on my ankle to knee until it looks mostly clean. Then knee up. Rinse. Then short strokes to clean up where ever i have missed"
338,"I have extremely sensitive skin. This is the only ritual so far that has worked for me every time without giving me razor burn. I also can't shave more than twice per week or else razor burn is a sure thing.

**Shaving ritual -**

1. Set up your laptop on top of your toilet and take a warm bath while you watch an episode of your favorite TV show. Or just sit and relax for 20-45 minutes. Whichever is your bathtime preference.
2. Exfoliate your legs with some kind of scrub. I use LUSH's Ocean Salt, usually.
3. Get your razor clean and ready. I use the Venus sensitive skin razors.
4. Shave from ankle to knee using coconut oil as shaving cream. Rinse every two or three strokes, depending on how thickly you put the coconut oil. I run mine under the bathtub faucet every time but you can just slosh it around in the bathtub water if that doesn't gross you out.
5. If you shave your thighs, repeat this process but shave from your knees up. I don't usually exfoliate that part of my legs if I'm shaving because my skin is much more sensitive there.
6. Afterwards, I rub coconut oil on my legs in place of lotion.
7. I drain my bathtub, turn on my shower, and wash my body/hair like normal. Then I've got smooth legs *and* I'm clean!"
339,"I shave in the bath. I blend up a cup of oatmeal in the blender and soak in it. Sometimes I'll exfoliate my legs with a sugar scrub. I use a Venus razor (the three blade one) and do long strokes, taking care to not press too hard. When I'm done I dip the razor in rubbing alcohol and don't store it in the bath. I soak in the bath for 10 more minutes. The oatmeal helps with moisture and irritation. "
340,"I shave in the shower. My ankle to my knee is 3-stroke high. I rinse my razor between each stroke, usually just under the shower head.

I find that rubbing coconut oil on my skin once my legs are dry is what makes everything smooth."
341,I use Dollar Shave Club razors. Started using coconut oil for shaving cream. Rinse every few strokes. Sometimes I use a cup for rinsing
342,"Are you talking about a dry shave? Use Venus brand razors. They wont destroy your legs. 

Since Venus has pretty good quality blades, I *barely* have to put any pressure on my skin when I shave with it. This decreases irritation. If your razor is *pulling* your hair before shaving it or cutting you easily, you have a bad blade. 

Razors that pull at hair have dull blades and need to be replaced. Razors that cut you easily have jagged blades which might be related to the quality of brand you have (or it might just be a factory fluke). 

In my experience it doesnt really matter if you do long or short strokes. You just have to do what it takes so that you are pressing the razor as lightly as possible on your skin, and is making contact with your skin as little as possible. 

I run the razor under the fauset or just tap it lightly inside the sink to remove the hair and wash it all down the drain when I am done.

Always follow up with something to moisterize your skin. Avoid scented lotions when you do this. They will irritate the skin. 

Of course when you have time to do it in the shower, do that. Its better for your skin since you can lather it up with soap first, which will be a barrier between the razor and your skin. If you shave in the shower there is no cleanup since the constantly running water takes care of that for you



"
343,"I shave in the shower and usually do my legs in three sections with long strokes. Ankle to below the knee, around the knee, above the knee to top of the thigh (mainly because if I'm not careful around my kneecaps I cut myself.) On the lower half of my legs I check with my hand to make sure it's smooth, and if I missed some I go over it again. I rinse the razor after the first leg and again after the second. I just use a disposable razor with Trader Joe's shaving cream."
344,"Razor: Gillete Mach 3 razor (men's)

Shave Gel: Kiehls' mens facial shaving cream

Stroke: Long strokes, ankle to knee first, carefully around the knee, knee and up

Place: In the shower, after lots of hot water. "
345,"Harry's razors, in the shower with ivory soap, ankle to knee. Rinse every couple of strokes."
346,"- Have legs be warm and wet.

- put on shaving cream (one of the women's ones, I had to experiment before I found the best, with Vitamin E).

- Shave very slowly and carefully. Short slow strokes (I put a lot of cream on). A few strokes until the lotion buildup behind the razor head is a fourth of an inch or so. Rinse in warm running water, repeat. 

It's easier for me to shave in the tub, but it wastes less water in the sink :(.

Edit: Why? Just why? "
347,"I hate having a little peach fuzz on my face, but my fiancé doesn't mind. He loves my face he's always stroking my face and telling me how soft and smooth my skin us.

He even likes to stroke my facial hair, which makes me self-conscious about it and I've had to ask him not to do that. Which I kind of feel bad about because he's just being affectionate, but I can't get over the feeling but I should've gotten rid of that little bit of peach fuzz on my cheeks.

So in short it's a problem for me but it's not a problem for him."
348,All he has to do is stroke my hair and I'm done.
349,"Kisses or strokes behind my ears... literal on/off switch. Especially if I am facing away (like standing in front of sink, for example) and he comes up behind me... umph"
350,"There's a small area of my back that acts as my ""off switch"" (or, I guess it should be called my ""on switch"").  When someone strokes it *very* gently or breathes on it, it makes me melt and I'm not capable of speech or having thoughts (other than ""ohhhhh"").

I don't know exactly where it is but it feels like it's just to the left of my spine and somewhere around the arch of my back.  Coincidentally, I have a large tattoo on my back, so my husband knows exactly which part of my tattoo is my ""sweet spot"".  He uses it to disable me when I'm being overly bitey and aggressive during sex.

Such a hardship."
351,"I'm a very anxious person and physical contact with my SO is one of the only things that really relaxes me. When I cuddle up against him and can feel his breathing and his heartbeat it honestly works better than xanax to soothe my nerves.

I also like how appreciative he is when I rub his shoulders, stroke his scalp, or touch him in pretty much any way. He's like a big purring cat, it's cute."
352,"> I also like how appreciative he is when I rub his shoulders, stroke his scalp, or touch him in pretty much any way. He's like a big purring cat, it's cute.

Mine's the same way!  It's adorable, and he'll wiggle into a closer snuggle while making cute noises.  He's the first guy I've dated who is as into being physically affectionate as I am and *I'm never going back.*  It makes me feel so happy and loved."
353,"""I really like NATURAL girls.""

This was said to me by an older (maybe 40ish) male customer when I was working in a chocolate shop. He reached over the register to stroke my arm to let me know how much he liked me.

I was so skeeved out that when I got home, I shaved the hair from my forearms (long story..I explain if you ask though) and have had bare forearms ever since."
354,"Growing up, I was told that only certain kinds of girls (really bad ones, I assumed at the time) shaved anything but their legs below about mid-thigh and their armpits. Even though I am about as hairy as a damn gorilla (and always have been) and it was super embarrassing for me to have this long, thick, dark hair on my forearms I wasn't allowed to shave it.

Once I moved out and got married, I really just didn't shave it because I was just like really meh about it. At least until that dude reached over my register and stroked me and started talking about how much he loved natural girls.

I am SO glad I have a son and not a daughter at this point. Because he takes after me and it's more socially acceptable for a guy to be hairy as fuck."
355,"Spilled a whole lot of mayo in a business guy's lap. 

Dropped a tray full of drinks in the middle of a business lunch. All over everyone. 

Tipped a whole glass of red wine into a guy's lap when he was clearly on a nice date with his wife. Probably ruined his pants but he was sweet about it. 

Dropped a stacked tray of glasses on a stone floor. 

Accidentally stabbed myself in the arm and passed out in the kitchen at work.

356,"I was a student TA and then a TA/assistant prof after grad school. So I was consistently between 1 and 4 years older. Can be interesting.

357,"Whatever you do, do not let them do any quick rotating maneuvers of your neck.  There are many documented cases of people having horrific strokes or dying from vertebral artery dissections from these maneuvers.  There was a widely publicized case just last year or so of a young woman who died of a massive stroke from an artery torn in her neck during a “cervical manipulation.”  "
358,">There are many documented cases of people having horrific strokes or dying from vertebral artery dissections from these maneuvers. 

The risk of this is nearly non-existent, and cervical manipulation has never been demonstrated to cause stroke, despite significant research.

The type of stroke chiropractic is rumored to cause, presents with symptoms of neck pain and headache. The current hypothesis is that the people that have these strokes are experiencing symptoms of the stroke already, which causes them to see a chiropractor.

A lot of the publicity surrounding this issue is sensationalized because the media does that with everything. 

If you're interested in seeing all of the up-to-date research let me know and I'll post it."
359,"I actually have access to the primary literature myself but thank you for offering.  I have read the paper published last year mentioning that patients likely already had arterial dissections starting before undergoing cervical manipulation.  If that is the case, then why take the risk of cervical manipulation prior to ruling out a dissection?  You can’t know that there is no dissection or vascular disease prior to cervical manipulation unless the patient has had vascular studies already done. The potential short term benefit from someone having their neck manipulated compared to the small risk of a catastrophic outcome in someone with an unknown underlying condition is something I think every patient should be informed of prior to consenting to cervical manipulation.  How many patients who had strokes do you think were told by their chiropractor prior to the maneuver that there is a risk of stroke if they do have a rare underlying arterial disease?  While the chance that they do have an underlying problem is small, I think it’s important for patients to be informed so they can decide for themselves if that is a risk they are willing to accept. "
360,"Every answer here so far talks about playing with hair. I'll be more specific, playing with the hair at my nape and stroking the back of my neck or under my ears. You know what, just imagine I'm a rather docile cat and stroke my head as you would hers and I'll be happy."
361,"I like having my head stroked or a shoulder squeeze. 

If it's from someone I'm romantically interested in, I like being touched on the small of the back and stroked on my neck."
362,"I'm 25, almost 26.

The last two years I've changed a lot, I feel. I realized that I need to stop eating so much junk food, because my weight does go up, it doesn't just stay the same like it did when I was 20. I also realized I need to start doing something physical -- so I started running.

My body has also been in turmoil for the last year or so. I'm actually having surgery in a little over two weeks to see if I have endometriosis. My periods have just kept getting worse and worse, and I'm in pain for a week before it now, too, which absolutely sucks. They've been bad since I was 16, but in the last year they've got increasingly worse.

I also firmly decided that I do not want children. I'm having my Fallopian tubes removed during my endo diagnostic surgery. Kids aren't for me. I love my job too much, I love my husband too much, and I genuinely like my life the way it is.

I've also gotten a lot more anxious and depressed, which is probably something I should deal with after this surgery passes. 

I hope I don't frighten you, because I seem to be in the minority here -- most of the other posts list pretty awesome things!"

Pee after sex, always - clears out the lady's urethra - prevents UTIs - tell her what UTI's are lol

Nutrition! I don't know what this free online course will be like but it's free :) https://www.coursera.org/course/lifenutr

One of my fav fun facts: Your body uses cholesterol to make bile (among other things), bile helps you digest fats, once your digested food and bile enter your intestines your body can absorb and recycle the bile for future use - BUT - if you eat a lot of fiber it get's trapped in you stool and gets eliminated. Then your gall bladder demands more cholesterol from your body and obtains it from your blood serum. Then blood serum levels of cholesterol go down. This is how eating OLD FASHIONED oats helps you reduce your cholesterol. 

Knowing how your body will fight tooth and nail to hold on to every excess carbohydrate. And all the secret sugars (dextrose, maltodextrin, etc) [note: every carb that isn't fiber that is]. Or just get her a Michael Pollan book for Christmas or something. "

If you're getting anal sex, then don't go from the ass to the fanny without washing it.


You can get condoms/dental dams super cheap online, it makes it easier to get a variety of sizes.

* Water: drink it, lots of it. Not only when you're thirsty but consistently throughout your day.
* Vitamin D: the stuff sunshine gives you is hard to get enough of. Take a supplement, it will make you feel more balanced.
* Exercise: Does not kill you, does make you stronger. Do it. Even if it is just a short walk every day.

367,"> I only have my period once every 3 months and the only reason I do is to make sure I'm not pregnant.

It can take a while for your period to settle down after stopping the pill, so don't worry if it doesn't return to normal right away.  Also, the first bleed is likely the withdrawal bleed, your body doesn't know if you've stopped altogether or just for the week.  Additionally, being on the pill shouldn't affect the result of a pregnancy test, so it's fine to just do the old pee-on-the-stick.

The advice from RememberYourPass refers to the combined pill, the mini-pill (progesterone only pill) is taken every day without breaks, and your period can remain normal, stop altogether, or anything in between.  Other methods can have different effects.

All things considered though, what every woman should know about contraception is: don't be afraid to ask your doctor (or whoever is prescribing) as many questions as you want about your contraceptive choices, including side effects, efficacy, method of action, effect on your period, and anything else that pops into your head.  There are no stupid questions.  The combined pill is most common, but far from the only option.  If you're not happy, go back and discuss it again.  If you don't think your doctor is listening to you, see somebody else.  Don't go without birth control just because the first method you tried didn't work out for you."
368,[FAST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAST_(stroke) is the stroke one. Mine generally use the Commonwealth spellings over US - I'd say your better off going through Google for that one. (eg 'medical mnemonics (topic)').
369,"Oof, I swam all thru high school and still go swim laps occasionally at the gym since. 

 The chlorine can be rough. If you are swimming every day or even several days a week, I would suggest getting a kick board and just doing kick laps every few days to give your hair a break from the chlorine. 

A little bit of spit in the goggles rubbed around with a quick rinse will keep them from getting foggy. 

Be sure to rinse your swim suit out in the shower/sink after *every* use to make it last longer. Absolutely don't leave it out in the sun to dry unless you want the spandex to die and the color to fade. 

Rinse your body off too, every time & MOISTURIZE. If you start swimming a lot, don't be surprised if you start to sweat chlorine :P 

Look up some workouts online, print them off and laminate them  and bring them to the pool with you to keep you on track. A one hour workout will go SO much faster and be so much more fun if it is made up of 6 ten-minute workouts rather than a straight 60 minutes swimming freestyle back and forth. Set goals and push yourself. 

Focus on technique, not speed. Once you've got the technique down, you'll notice that the speed will come naturally. But if you don't figure out how to do the strokes properly, you'll more than likely end up tiring yourself out quickly and not really going anywhere. I kind of see it like using an elliptical. Yeah, you can step on and start going full power with the machine off or on the easiest resistance, but....are you really accomplishing anything? 

I've always thought that backstroke is a great stroke for when you need a little break, because you don't need to time your breaths with your strokes. Learn how many strokes it takes you to get from the flags to the wall so you don't have to keep doing that awkward head-lean-back-thing to make sure you aren't about to hit concrete. "
370,"Wet your hair and body down **fully** before you enter the pool area. Invest in some swimmer's shampoo and conditioner, like the UltraSwim chlorine removal line (from target), that's what I use.

Caps suck imo, so I typically braid my long blonde hair and make sure its wet AF before I get in and that I wash and condition it properly on the way out. Haven't gone green yet and I've been swimming for workouts for the last few years. 

Make sure in addition to proper hair care, that you moisturize your body thoroughly because chlorine will dry your skin out in a major way.

Break up your strokes and your routine (sometimes I'll do 10 laps freestyle, then 5 more of backstroke as a 'break', then 10 more freestyle etc etc) and BRING A WATER BOTTLE WITH YOU TO THE POOL. People totally forget that you need to replenish your fluids when you're working out hard in a pool ... cause well, it's wet.

Swimming totally rocks. The best part for me is zenning out to the sounds of the water. And I have to focus on breathing and not drowning so it prevents any other random thoughts from going thru my head. Nothing like an hour and a half of pure me-time. 


Enjoy
"
371,"I have bleached hair AND ""fun colours"" so I'm very paranoid about my hair getting messed up by the chlorine.  I wet and braid my hair tightly (french braid pigtails) before I leave the house and pop it all under a silicone cap.  I'm saving up for a better swimsuit as the one I have now, while it's a one-piece, isn't ideal for lap swimming as it's got underwire support.  I'm going to buy something a little more full-coverage soon.  

I go with my partner so it's a little less boring, and we stop and chat/defog our goggles every few laps.  It's a really small 5-lane community pool and there are usually only 2 other people there so we aren't taking up lanes from other people by doing this, but obviously in a bigger/busier pool we'd be a little more focused on the exercise. 

I switch between front crawl and backstroke mostly, and I might switch to occasionally using a kickboard so I can focus more on my legs.  We've only been going for about a month and once it warms up, I think we'll also add a walk/jog to and from the pool with our gear in a backpack, since it's only about 10 minutes away."
372,"Well not a lady, but have swum competitively or in a professional manner for like 20+ years. 

It's all about your stroke /hydrodynamics. Often I see people with no kick or bad kick which just drags you through the water. 

So do kick sets. 

Next issue I see people have no roll or glide; their arms come in too soon from this poor form. Your arms should be stretching out almost on your side. (Which is then easier to breath to your side)

Start out with intervals and then build up. It's all about putting in the time."
373,"I don’t know if they had a style. They were firm usually (but my mom was inclined to believe anything we said so we could get away with more with  my mom) but generally fair. 

I think the key to discipline is being consistent and not caving. Even with my almoat three year old, I see him boundary pushing to see what he can get away with all the time. I need to establish myself as his parent, someone to respect and listen to but also who loves him and will protect him no matter what. My dad was very good at that and my mom excels at loving and protecting, but was somewhat less consistent with standing firm.

I think they were and are great parents. I think all three of us turned out mostly ok. All three of us have had struggles but through all of them, they were there. And all kids struggle, and struggles and more don't mean “parenting was bad” necessarily.

There are a few things I am doing differently with my son but they’ve given me a solid framework. I feel very blessed to have that "
374,"IMO, the first idea with a guy fishing is way better than the edited. I didn't assume at first it would be a guy that looked Asian in the painting, I kind of imagined him wearing a fishing hat and maybe looking or facing away so you couldn't see him anyway. The part about painting it in traditional Chinese brushstroke style is the only part I'm unsure about, because unless you know he's a fan of that style personally, it might seem like an assumption, like ""oh you're Chinese so you must like Chinese style art"" and also unless you have experience painting in that style I'm not sure I'd go for that. But with that said, I think the man fishing his with dogs idea is waaaaay better for this gift, it will be be more special and personalized that way. Good luck! "
375,"From what little I know of Chinese culture, gifts are a big thing. (Or is it Japan? Someone, please correct me if I'm ignorant.) The two of you are friendly, he's told you these personal things, and you want to show your appreciation. I think it's a good idea, and I don't see how the motive you're considering could in any way be interpreted as disrespectful/cultural stereotyping.

 How about painting the guy from the back, in addition to broad brush strokes?"
376,"Do the brush stroke trad pic with the dogs its a great idea.

Or the other one has a genius fisheye lens view of the whole scene from the other side.

Both are brilliant and not stereotyping at all in the personal circumstances."
377,"I have a few. I'll try narrow it a bit!

Franz Ferdinand at Manchester Apollo in 2004 - generally fun gig plus  my friend got aftershow passes so I met them after. Lots of good memories from that gig!

Muse at Earl's Court 2004 (first night more than second) In those days the stage theatrics didn't overwhelm the music. I am not a fan of their recent tour set ups. It was also their first ""huge"" gig I think?

A band called The Cooper Temple Clause at Leeds Met in 2006ish. Really fun, amazing gig with good company.

A band called Seafood at Victoria Inn Derby in around 2002. Really small, sweaty gig and I was at the front. Not an amazing band but an enjoyable show.

New entry: FFS (Franz Ferdinand and Sparks collaboration) at Glasgow Barrowlands a couple of weeks ago. Both bands were having so much fun on their joint songs and individual material. Also Scottish crowds are just something else compared to English crowds!

I'll stop now..."
378,"I saw the strokes during their first couple of tours. The show for Is This It? was amazing. I think my best show was m83. Saw them a couple of years ago. It was amazing how well their live music sounded exactly like the recorded which I did not expect at all since there is such a strong electronic element to their sound. Contrast to when I saw Animal Collective a few years prior and I was pretty disappointed. Still love them, was not a terrible show but I think I have been spoiled."
379,"I'm seeing The Strokes there too! I'm pumped.

Honestly, the most fun I've ever had at a concert was seeing FUN. right as ""We Are Young"" was getting really popular. The whole crowd was super into it, and the band was really energetic. They played a lot of their older stuff, which was great. 

Also, The 1975 is amazing live, I will see them every time they play anywhere near me, I <3 them sooo much."
380,"Yo, I'll see you at ACL for the strokes. I'll be the one screaming the loudest.  
  
In all seriousness, the twice I've seen the strokes have been the best concerts I've been to, just because their music means so much to me."
381,"Interesting! I find that the easiest thing to shave... 
I shave 'em every time I hop in the shower. Hop in, shampoo first, followed by body wash and shaving. Simple as that! I use the same razor I use with my legs, and body wash does the trick. Don't press, just glide against the grain: stroke upwards from the bottom, and downwards from the top. Sometimes I even go sideways to make sure I got it all. Once you're down to stubble, it's a simple swipe of the blade every other time you shower. Also! I might be drunk while I typed this so I hope it makes sense! Haha good luck! "
382,"I've heard a lot of men complain about this, including my SO who was on swim team in HS. Honestly, it may sound nuts, but I'm pretty sure I just have badass armpits. If I'm in a hurry, I can even get a quick shave without cream or gel. Just get em wet, shave fast, and go. I guess years if shaving has made them less sensitive?

The trick I use with my junk (which is still super sensitive) is just using a fresh blade and a healthy amount of shaving cream, warm water, rinse after every stroke. Good luck!"
383,"Use soap or shaving cream. Raise your arm over your head so your pit is flattened as much as possible. I start with strokes up, then turn the razor and do downward strokes to catch any strays."
384,"If you're coming into it with longish hair, I'd use a trimmer on it first to get it nice and short.  You'll have to use fewer passes that way, and fewer passes means fewer opportunities to nick yourself."
385,"I really love [Jill Bolte Taylor's 'Stroke of Insight' talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight.html).  Jill is a neuroscientist who shares her story of studying her own stroke as it happened.  Says some crazy shit about ""right"" and ""left brained-ness"" and what it feels like to have your brain scramble reality as we typically know it."
386,Fixed the link; it's [this one](http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html). Have fun! I love the speaker's passion/excitement/energy.
387,"Trust me , go for at it 2 times a day for weeks, and you are going to get a pinky one.

Recently since I pretty much just realized am jacking off every other day 2 times at it, I decided to try and count the strokes it takes till the first feeling of cuming , and try different strokes and rithm. That was enhanced with a few bowls while taking a hot bath.

Now I decided to not use any porn for visuary images and just do it without it. This was also an attempt at just reducing my porn, but at the same time just leaving my masturbation alone, but enhance the skills I could learn, and endurance I can endure while learning my limits.

So basically what I had in mind was practicing trying to hold it as much as I could, first by stopping stroking it , then by keeping stroking while counting the strokes.

For the first week it was hard to hold it in, even though I ve been jacking earlier, I never tried to hold it off much or actually count it. So it was hard. After 2-4 weeks I started noticing that I was like improving, like what I found out that helped was. That I started viewing how applying a rithm consisting with a wide array of strokes and at different pace, I could actually build up the load bigger.

In other words, prolonging the shoot up. I discovered instead of going at the same pace and like do it faster, I could actually change my pace to keeping from shooting up.

The only thing I can say though is that, you really need to put a lot of focus on it, and no distractions and concentrate on a sexual image. At the same time I have a bucket that I use to pour the hot water from the bath and slowly drip it over my penis while am stroking with the other one. I found that little trick gets the engine going,like it responds to the warm water instantly and stretches my muscles, almost to the same extent as  how a cat does when he is pouring. 

Its not bad, I mean I can feel that am increasing much . However, I noticed much more of the improvement on the 4-6 weeks, after doing this for about like 16-20 I really don't see as much of an improvement per week as the first ones. Now funny enough, am actually trying to do a different tracking.

Since I can pretty much hold my load longer, from having exercise my pc muscles from those kegel exercises, I am actually intrigue in finding the distance of how far I can shoot my load. I figured, that if am not going to be in a relationship now, it would be better to improve on my skills on masturbation and get rid of the porn and just using my imagination.

So far though, it has been great. It was hard at first, but it has the greatest degree of satisfaction comparing to just watching porn and releasing my load.

After releasing it , while at the same time being high in a hot bath, I feel the greatest rush going through my body with great relief. The only downside is that, my dick start to hurts sometimes, because sometimes I can go on and do it 3 times, in a session. Seems weird but I can stay in a bath for 3-4 hours just taking break, and relaxing, first hour to hour and half I do from 1 to 3 sessions and the rest I just sit there relaxing in a profound way checking my problems and dropping them of my list by analyzing them with a more positive state of mind.

Its weird , i know guy who jacks off in a bath, but oh well fuck it. I find it a very good way to channel off my release, a hot bath, some weed, and a bucket, for pouring, and most importantly a great imagination let free."
388,"Yes, the longer I grow my hair, the more people treat me like a newly arrived immigrant. 

Also, men touch my hair all the time which is really fucking annoying. I rarely wear my hair down anymore because I just don't want to one day find some random guy's semen in my hair.

Sometimes women touch it but they always ask first. Usually it's old white ladies who think I look like an exotic rapunzel.

When I bleached it and died it blonde, I got a lot of comments about how ""trashy"" it looks. 

It's currently mid-thigh length which is the longest it's ever been. My mum had ankle length hair most of her life and she had similar experiences. A guy on the bus once tried to cut a bunch off with a stanley knife which was obviously terrifying for her.

I can understand that people are intrigued by very long hair because it's uncommon in Western countries but I cannot imagine being so disgusting and presumptuous that I would think it's okay to stroke a person's hair without warning. "
389,"I'm a long haired man and I get treated very differently.

Some people automatically assume I'm a trouble maker or do drugs. Some people ask me if I'm gay. Sometimes random dudes throw the metal horns up at me. Strangers compliment my hair and start asking about it (I've had bank staff and estate agents do this).

Random women seem to think it's okay to touch my hair. I've been watching a band and felt a tug on my head and realised the women behind me were playing with my hair. I've walked past a woman in a bar and had her reach out and stroke my hair as I went past, without saying anything to me at all.

Male acquaintances will just randomly bring it up and ask me how I can be bothered to have it so long, under what circumstances I would cut it and give me the ""advice""  that if I cut it I would be more popular with women."
390,"> Also, men touch my hair all the time which is really fucking annoying.

>I cannot imagine being so disgusting and presumptuous that I would think it's okay to stroke a person's hair without warning. 

Long haired man here, women do this to me all the time."
391,"I used to try to explain myself but really, sometimes it's just that way because it is.  Why is it so long?  Because I haven't cut it yet.  That's literally all it is.  Also, not everything needs an explanation, imo.  When my son was born he was 7lbs.   Everywhere we went people said ""Small baby!""  Just, like, in passing.  What am I supposed to say to that?  I know he's small, I pushed him out of my body, I'm holding him right now.  I also ate everything under the sun while I was pregnant (like full meals, ever hour, day and night).  He came out the size he came out.  I was going to start going around making similar comments.  ""Curly hair!""  ""Pajama pants!"" ""Red shirt!""

Sorry, that's off the hair topic.  But yeah.  Some people like to make comments and I am over trying to make explanations for things I have no explanations for.  I don't owe them anything, lol.  And if they're going to say something that sounds like an observation, I will either agree or disagree, and I'm done talking about it, unless they have legit questions."
392,"I think it's more socially acceptable for women to touch guys than the reverse. If I stroked a strange woman's hair then I would be seen as creepy and a potential rapist, but if a strange woman strokes my hair I'm supposed to be flattered? I know power relations make men seem more threatening but it still sucks that women don't seem to get called out on violating personal space the same way men do."
393,"Yup. Held him, cuddled him, snuggled with him in bed, kissed his forehead, stroked his hair, consoled him if he wanted it"
394,"He has a few times. His dad passed away almost three years ago, when he was 19. Every once in a while it gets to him and he breaks down. I just hold him and let him get it out. Tell him I love him and I'm sorry. "
395,Yes. Our passionate discussion came to an abrupt halt and I helped him through it. He has Aspergers so stress became a meltdown.  Helping him through that became the immediate priority.  
396,A few times. I held him and comforted him and kissed him and stroked his face and reminded him of how incredible he is and snuggled him to sleep. 
397,"Stroke it, act like a 90s Austin Powers villain. "
398,"My dad's side of the family has a ""hug quota"". We actually just discussed it today. It isn't a man thing... He has three sisters. We all just don't really hug or do much physically affectionate stuff. I left their house with three bottles of wine, half a loaf of bread, a bunch of spare facial stuff, and ice packs (???). That's our love.

My grandfather went into surgery after a stroke. My aunt told him that we all loved him. As his kids' representative. He understood. That's just how they are. My aunt made sure today that my granddad had his fridge fully stocked with pancakes. That's love. Anyone can hug.

Sometimes it's easier to ask whoever I'm dating to come to a family outing (I even offer to DD). Then they understand."
399,"I used to be. I don't come from an affectionate family - at all. We never touched, hugged, or came in any sort of physical contact that wasn't hitting. We *never* said things like ""I love you"", ""I care about you"", ""I miss you"", or anything remotely similar. My family was like a bunch of roommates living together, at least after my mom passed when I was very little, so once it was time to date people I would get really uncomfortable with expressions of affection. It literally just confused me and I didn't know how to react. I just started forcing myself to get used to it and now I'm a very sweet/affectionate person, but earlier on...my stomach would tie in knots and I would break into sweats over something as simple as ""I miss you"" from a guy, and I would flinch as if about to be hit whenever they moved to touch me."
400,"I think you just have to find the right person to make you feel comfortable about things. Before, I never felt comfortable calling a boyfriend ""Honey,"" ""Baby,"" ""Sweetheart,"" etc. before I was dating my current boyfriend. I'm also not one for touching, at all.

My boyfriend will stroke my hand with a finger and if it feels weird, I pull away and rub my hand on something because it just makes me feel uncomfortable. But that being said, I'm more comfortable with touching or being close to him than I have with anyone else. He makes me feel more comfortable when I'm not feeling that way around anyone else.

Also, if it's not something that you like or feel comfortable with, find another way to show your affection, or make sure they're in the same boat or at least understanding. 

Also also, just because you may not be comfortable with someone at first, doesn't mean that you won't grow to be comfortable with them after a while."
401,"I hate touchy feely Crap. I'm often called cold or standoffish because I like my personal space. 
That being said, I can cuddle and be very affectionate with certain people. My ex, who's now one of my best friends, I can stroke his head, hold his hand, cuddle, etc and no uncomfortable feelings arise, but other than him, yeah not so Much. I can deal with a little but not Like with him. I was dating a guy who was VERY touchy feely. Always trying to touch me, hold my hand, stroke my hair, etc. Made me push him away eventually because well....ENOUGH. "
402,He likes it when I stroke his beard. :)
403,"I feel like the most lovely thing on the planet. I love being touched by my bf, when he strokes my skin or my hair, oh wow...."
404,"Lightly stroke the side of my body such that i can tell he's idly feeling both the softness of my skin and the way my body curves down and in from the side of my breast to my waist and then flares up and out again from my waist to my hips. Every once in a while, so's that I can't predict it, an upward stroke would continue to my neck or cheek and a downward one to my thigh. Oh...shivers."
405,"""Push boundaries"" is probably the wrong word here. I don't like it when people push my boundaries. If I want to go further, I will let him know I am moving the boundary by putting his hand on my body, or moving my hand to his body (under the shirt, into his pants).

If she seems shy and to be totally passive, ask her using words. ""Are you comfortable with... ?"" If not say ""That's okay, this is nice too."""
406,"If you're a newly de-converted Christian, I'd agree that you probably won't like /r/atheism.  A lot of long time atheists tend to be obnoxiously vocal about how they don't like it, either.  I find /r/exchristian, /r/TrueAtheism, and /r/Buddhism to be great places to go to find actual discussion and conversation, rather than just memes and posts designed to inflame.

As for answering your original question, when I want a guy to push or go passed my physical boundaries, I will generally guide his hand if he seems timid.  Even if he doesn't, I tend to be very clear with what I want and don't want in bed, or even in making out.  It can be very hard to get over a lot of the hang-ups and restrictions imposed upon oneself as a Christian (it's been 4 years for me), so just take it slow and make sure you feel comfortable doing anything - unless your discomfiture is a remnant of the religiousness, because then feel free to push through it a bit and see how you feel."
407,"I've seen a lot of women having heart attacks and they have all displayed the typical ""classic"" heart attack signs and symptoms.  They describe crushing, squeezing, or heavy pain in the center of their chest, often shortness of breath, pain radiation to the jaw or L arm, and they have all had an intense sense of fear/impending doom.  

There is always the possibility of having an atypical presentation though, such as nausea which won't go away, ""not feeling right"", and abnormal weakness/fatigue.  These types of symptoms are more common in the elderly/diabetic community. 

If you have a strong history of heart disease in your family, you can ask your primary care doctor to refer you to a cardiologist so you can get a cardiac stress test (walking/running on a treadmill hooked up to an EKG).  The entire test takes about an hour and can help see if there's any signs that suggest heart disease.  "
408,"Do you see a cardiologist? I think that would be the best person to talk to about what symptoms you should pay attention to and what you can safely ignore.

My dad had a heart attack last summer. He had chest pain, and his dad died of a heart attack, so he went to the hospital. Lucky him, because he was in the hospital with a cardiologist present when he actually had the heart attack. They were able to act very quickly, and that's probably why he didn't suffer any permanent damage. He has recovered fully.

The moral of that story being, consult a professional and do not screw around."
409,"If you're worried about breast cancer or heart attacks then you'll need to keep a watch out for signs and signals. Grab a card from your doctor about how to give yourself a breast exam and hang it in the shower (Just a simple lump test). You can check every day, or once a week. Whatever makes you feel comfortable.

While classic heart attack symptoms do occur, studies directed towards women's health show that they may not be present at all with heart attack in women. It may be helpful to familiarize yourself with both sets of symptoms.
 [Link](http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartAttack/WarningSignsofaHeartAttack/Heart-Attack-Symptoms-in-Women_UCM_436448_Article.jsp) to American Heart Association article.

I wouldn't be afraid to talk with specialists in both areas to discuss what your options are for prevention, and what steps you need to take as you get older. My family has numerous breast cancer survivors and two members who suffered from heart attacks. It will definitely ease your mind to know as much as you can. "
410,My sister had a heart attack.  She didn't experience *any* symptoms other than blanching.  Luckily she was in the hospital at the time (visiting) and a nurse asked her if she felt alright and then they started doing the tests or whatever it is you do to diagnose a heart attack. 
411,"What do you do? I did have an EKG and stress test done a few years ago (as well as an ultrasound of my heart). The EKG showed bradycardia. Stress test was fine. The mitral valve is allowing some blood to regurgitate which showed up on the ultrasound but the cardiologist wasn't concerned about it.

I keep reading that women have atypical symptoms so I was curious."
412,"I wish you the best and a complete recovery. And you know, it's never too late--as long as you're living--to take charge of your health. My mom didn't begin exercising and eating better until after her heart attack a couple years ago. Since then, she hired a trainer at a gym and went on a diet. She has dropped a LOT of weight and several sizes--she looks better than I ever remember! And she is 67."
413,"How old was your sister when she had the heart attack? I guess if you're gonna have one, it's better to already be in a hospital. Was she under a lot of stress at the time?"
414,"That is really interesting about the sense of doom! That's not something I've ever seen listed under symptoms..

I have acid reflux and am used to my reflux, but a few years ago I had very unusual chest pain and began having a panic attack when it didn't go away. Went to the ER, they ran some tests to make sure I wasn't dying then sent me home with a dx of heartburn. 

I felt a little silly but better safe than sorry."
415,"That seems like a very easy lie to uncover (assuming you know your measurements and the average size of a penis), so it doesn't make sense to say unless it's true.  I certainly haven't.

There are plenty of ways to compliment a not-big dick without lying about its size.  I use those ego strokes more liberally."
416,"I've only ever told one guy I was with that his penis was huge, and it was because it actually hurts me. 

Others I did tell they were a good size, when they were. I've never told someone they were big to stroke his ego. I've always been honest. "
417,"For me, no. I've only said it when it's certainly true, and I'm very well aware of averages and so forth. In fact, I've only said it once, to my now ex-husband. I don't feel the need to falsely ""stroke a man's ego"" on penis size, since I don't believe penis size should be an ego-thing. There's a lot of things I love about a partner's penis, if it's not notably large I'm not going to tell him it isn't, and he'd know I was lying anyway so why bother?"
418,"I am sure other people will have some better tips but here's what has worked for me. 

You don't necessarily have to deep throat. You can use your hand in conjunction with your mouth, stroking up and down with it as you take the head in your mouth as far as you want to go. Let it be very wet --  drool a bit so your hand moves smoothly and wetly along with your mouth. You want it to seem like they are kind of one unit. Watch your teeth. Use your tongue to stimulate the frenulum (the knotty looking part on the underside of the penis) and gently squeeze and stroke the shaft with your hand. Using the other hand, stroke the balls or the perineum, or whatever your guy responds to more. 

Beyond this, it's really a good idea for you to solicit some direction from your man in terms of what he really wants from you. He's going to have particular sensitive parts that only he can really tell you about. 

Make sure you are enthusiastic, most of all, about learning how he works and doing it in general. Look up at him sometimes if you take a break to just lick the thing and tease him. Smile and make sounds. Admire him. Enjoy the experience. "
419,"I have a HORRIBLE gag reflex. I thought I wouldn't be able to give good head ever, but now every man who I give head has told me that I give INCREDIBLE blowjobs. I do pride myself in it.

My biggest tip: USE YOUR HANDS. You do not have to deep throat. Put your hand around the base and then stroke as you move your head up and down his shaft. Also make sure to get it really wet. I'm not joking when I say slobber all over that cock (just try not to make it look like you're a drooling dog). 

You'll get the hang of it over time. I've been giving head since age 16 and I don't think I really got good until this last year (21). It takes time and practice. You'll learn best from experience."
420,"There's a great new alternative for younger women who want an IUD called Skyla. Check it out!

You should tell your mom that the risk of stroke is so statistically low that it's almost irrelevant. Unless you smoke, have a blood disorder, or are over forty, it's not something to worry about.

Furthermore, you should remind your mom (if you think you can do this without putting yourself in emotional or physical danger because of her judging you or something) that, as a maturing girl, you're going to be doing things that could put you at risk for way worse consequences than a broken heart, which is probably her biggest concern with you having sex.

I'd recommend one of two ways to approach the topic:

1. Going out to shop or do something else which doesn't require being side-by-side or face-to-face. That way, the embarrassment factor is lower, and she doesn't have the opportunity to overreact. Another good option is to go to dinner so that you can have something to do if there are any awkward pauses or have an excuse if you need time to prepare a response to one of her questions.

2. Let her broach a similar topic (no later than, like, a week from now, though -- it's imperative you get protected soon!) and derail the conversation into birth control. If she talks about you having a boyfriend, mention that you're considering being with someone and want to be safe just in case. If she talks about a doctor's visit, ask whether she has the time to help pick out a gyno or visit Planned Parenthood to see about birth control.

Tips:

* Don't waver. If you're confident and strong going into the conversation, she'll be less likely to try to string you out until you submit to her decision.

* Do a little bit of research. Are your PMS symptoms irrationally bad? That probably rules out most long-term ones, like the shot or the IUD, because they're progesterin only and that's the hormone that makes you feel gross, bloated, and angry before your period. (This is a gross oversimplification of a very complex topic.)

* When researching, try to find your top three choices. This could be generics (the shot, the pill, the implant) or specific (Skyla, Implanon, Depo Provera). That way, she can't shoot you down entirely if she wants to insist on a different option, and you look like you know your stuff.

* Try to get a handle on the insurance equation. Do you have private insurance, and if so, do they have an exemption from covering it? Will you have a co-pay? Do you qualify for free birth control from your state? Your mom will have a harder time ignoring you if you have specific info.

* Come into the conversation with a specific provider in mind. Do you want to go through your GP, gynecologist, or Planned Parenthood? Would it be easier to pick it up from a PP clinic or a pharmacy? Do you want a discreet option like the shot so no one knows you're on it, and if so, does your doctor provide it?

A few last notes:

I'm a little confused by your statement that you're not sure if you're comfortable with the insertion process. Is that because you don't want people near your vagina? I like to point out that if you're sexually active, someone else has very private access to you, so you most likely shouldn't be self-conscious! It's not like a doctor is going to judge you.

Make sure to use condoms! They're for more than pregnancy prevention, it's about safety in more ways than you know. Since you're young, you're at a higher risk for STIs and haven't learned all the secrets of your body, so you could turn out to be allergic to something like lubricant, and the reaction could cause easier transmission. (I always recommend getting tested every six months, just because it's possible to contract one and not know it, then pass it on unaware!) Everyone's body is susceptible to certain things -- colds, the flu, cancer, bronchitis, you name it and millions of people have it -- and STIs are no different.

Finally, I'd recommend taking at look at plannedparenthood.org and using their My Method test to find one that'll suit you. bedsider.org is another of my favorites and they have comparison options and a way to view all of them in a chart which displays their different qualities, like the ability to be spontaneous, the discreetness, and the reliability.

Oh, and I wanted to mention: 99% of the stories you hear about birth control are unreliable because of their statistical insignificance. Studies have shown that the average weight gain due to BC is five pounds and the rest is usually a result of comfort levels rising or other situational circumstances. The myth of the IUD dislodging is widespread but very statistically insignificant -- we're talking a few hundred to a few thousand people out of sheer millions. Make sure to do thorough research if your mom tries to bring these points up -- again, plannedparenthood.org is a good resource, and although it's tricky to navigate, guttmacher.org has some good studies on this stuff, too!

(For younger women, I usually recommend Skyla, which provides three years of coverage, or one of the dozens of pills if they're looking for the most potent anti-acne and period-reducing side effects. A lot of women are uncomfortable with the ring because they don't like to get intimate with themselves like that, but it's a very reliable method, and you should be comfortable with it if you're having sex!)"
421,"Have you shown her the statistics proving that the risk of stroke is low? (Especially for a nonsmoker).  Does she know that you are sexually active now? If she does, you should stress the importance of preventing pregnancy. If she doesn't, you might want to tell her so that she doesn't blow you off because she's not worried about you getting pregnant. I'd also say that while acne reduction and shorter periods are great, your priority should really be on keeping yourself safe from unwanted pregnancy now. Also, IUDs aren't typically in women your age because many doctors refused to prescribe them for young women, but studies have shown that they're safe and extremely effective for teens. It's a lot better to go with something more effective, better safe than sorry. I personally have been on the Nuva Ring for 8 years and have never had an issue. If you aren't sure that you'll be able to take a pill at the same time every day, you might want to look into other forms."
422,"I'm been on the pill since I was 16, so about 7 years now, and the only issues I've ever had is the occasional breakthrough bleeding.  Strokes risk increases with age and smoking, but really you should be fine.  Honestly, my mom was a little upset that I was having sex at that age, but also didn't want me getting pregnant.  

I had problems with breakthrough bleeding and I've found that ortho-cyclen works best for preventing that.  "
423,"implanon doesn't have the stroke risk, very reliable and easy to use (put it in, works for 3 years). That said, unless you need your mum for money/taking you to the doctor ect, you should just talk to the doctor"
424,"Do you have any family history of blood clots or stroke?  If so, your mother's concerns are far from unreasonable.  I know being young helps make it seem unlikely, but it does happen, and even if it doesn't have lifelong consequences, treatment makes IUD insertion seem like a breeze.  

Depending on your financial situation, you and your mother may be able to reach a compromise where you get tested for clotting conditions before going on the pill.  They aren't cheap tests, and you would need to talk to your doctor and get a blood draw, but knowing you're not part of a high-risk group could put you both at ease.  

Honestly, though, I'd recommend going to a gyno, and discussing your options with the gynecologist and your mother.  A doctor will know what's worked for patients in her practice, as well as being up to date on products and research.  Keep an open mind, and worry more about what'll work for you than what you think is ""normal"" for people your age.  "
425,"Well, since she is concerned about the risk of stroke - do some research. The risk in a young, healthy person who doesn't smoke is crazy low. You are more likely to die in a car crash going to pick up the Rx from the pharmacy. "
426,"Problem: I'm extremely uncomfortably ticklish on the bottom of my feet (and only there.)

So, you can stroke my feet anywhere but the bottom, and I'll do whatever to yours - just nothing that'd tickle me. "
427,"I make sure that my work is always high quality and well exceeds expectations. I am not social outside of work environments with anyone alone. I don't accept any position where the hiring manager has expressed even slight interest in me beyond my work. It sounds like a lot and some people consider my way too restrictive, but it has worked well and I am both respected and appreciated for the consistent quality of work in my field. "
428,"In this situation, I would guess the fact that you two would never see each other again was her free pass to be an incredible selfish lover. I don't usually go for platitudes but in this case it's true; it's not you it's her.  You were used for sex like a thing instead of a person and that feels gross.  She's an ass or maybe just really really bad at sex. Either way, yay(!) to not having to do that again.

I don't do one night stands or even casual sex because I find it incredibly unfulfilling physically as well as mentally.  It's like getting my mind fuck instead of my body."
429,"Yes, that was just my description. I posted it here to see if someone could come at it from another perspective. I know when I read one side I sometimes have one of those ""Now, wait a moment..."" moments. I actually did say something to my friend, the one who set this up, because I needed to vent. He just said to remember that she lives far away and not to worry. I'm probably a hypocrite for thinking this, but I know talking to him isn't going to really matter, while her talking to his girlfriend (her good friend) could be bad. It's not specifics I'm worried about, it's just that, if you have a bad experience, you'll have a bad perception of that person, and you can pass that perception along to others who trust you.

I think I realized that if I'm having such a problem with this, I don't need to enter into any kind of relationship, short or long term, or have any hookups, until I fix myself."
430,"I'm a fan of the ""choke stroke"" as I call it. A hand firmly on my trachea turns me the fuck on. Not restricting my breathing or anything, but gentle and firm squeeze, ooh. *shiver*

Hair pulling is up there too."
431,"Doing things together: don't be wishy-washy all the time, but you're only human. You aren't an entertainment factory. It's equally frustrating for anyone, male or female, to dance the ""I don't know, what do you wanna do?"" dance.

Shopping together: do people seriously, early in relationships, get asked shit like, ""Will you buy this for me?"" How rude. It's hard for me to address this because it's so far beyond the behaviour I'd consider appropriate earlier in a relationship. Once you've been together for a longer time, suggesting an item you might like for a present is cool but if a lady is gonna do that you should be able to do that too. That said, joking about your mistress liking it seems like such a douchey, PUA way to handle this.

Making it rain: it really depends on the lady. I think the best gift is tailored to an individual. Some people like experiences, others like items they can use for experiences, some like beautiful items they can admire and attach memories to. This advice is too generic. Personally, I quite like items I can keep that become sentimentally tied to a partner, but my favourite gift my SO has ever given me was a relatively inexpensive pack of drawing pens that happened to combine two of my favourite drawing styles in a way that most pens can't handle. It was the sheer attentiveness to my artistic style that melted my heart about this gift, because I'd never encountered anything like these pens before but they were just perfect for the kind of art I do, and that's specifically why he got them.

The crying game: I really rather like being asked what's going on. Sometimes it helps to talk while sobbing. If I just want to cry it out, I'll say so, but hell, I'm pretty good at articulating my emotional needs, and I know that isn't true of everyone. When enough time has passed, sometimes it can be nice to try to tell a joke to help me escape the sadness, but at first just letting me feel my feelings is pretty good.

Compliments and flattery: nah. I mean, don't talk about her like she's a goddess built from gold and cheat codes, but once you're in a secure and loving relationship, compliments can flow pretty freely and happily, and it's a beautiful thing. They just shouldn't dominate your conversations, because shit, that becomes more like worship than connection.

Advice: this is bullshit. However, take into account that a lady is a person with a brain just like you, and is capable of solving her own problems. If you find yourself in that age-old ""she wants to vent but I wanna give her advice about her problems"" conundrum, there's a simple solution - ask her if she'd like advice, commiseration or distraction. Everyone appreciates having their preferences taken into account!

Conversational fluff: if your SO bores you, don't date her. If you don't feel capable of talking with her, hey, you could be a relatively quiet person, but that level of talking differential sounds more like you aren't really interested in having conversations with her at all. It certainly doesn't sound like a fun ratio to me, or a ratio that my male SO would enjoy much. I think he'd feel pretty erased if he got to talk that little.

Wow, so you found possibly the least overtly misogynist article on Roissy's blog. I'm almost impressed.

"
432,"Sigh. Sometimes I wonder what these men's opinion of my boyfriend would be. But then I stop wondering because I'm too busy blowing him until the sun rises, and then little-spooning him until we fall asleep.

It's incredible to me how PUA culture seems perfectly okay defining masculinity by a specific set of actions, but passes over anything that speaks to values, self-awareness, compassion and integrity. I guess because it's harder to be a person of integrity than to toss out a quip about motorcycles and buy your girlfriend a dress five sizes too small. Oh well."
433,"There is not much correlation between amount of sexual intercourse with a man and my trying on his last name. Usually its with guys I like to some degree and of course boyfriends. It's not really connected to any actual thoughts of marriage, just something fun.

As an academic, and hopefully a published researcher in the future I will be keeping my maiden name for professional uses. (Once you get published its important to keep your name consistent throughout your career)

Privately/legally it depends on where I live and cultural things so in that sense I do think about how my name would work. NOTE: Unless marriage was seriously on the table I doubt I would actually talk about it."
434,"4 months dating a guy, but that was because I was mid pregnancy scare and he made a passing comment about marrying me. "

Massage can help with shortened and tightened muscles.

Neck and Chest muscles (SCM, Scalenes, Pecs) are often shortened due to poor posture caused by ""desk work"" (As a PC gamer, mine are too) 

These often cause your back muscles to stretch and overextert themselves, (That chronic neck and trap pain everyone has) 

What you can do to help the muscles relax is scrub the attachment points of the muscles as it stimulates the Golgi Tendon Organ which sends signals for the muscles to release, as well as releasing endorphins. (If you ever had a good massage and felt a good ""woozy"" after, or during certain bedroom activities, it's probably the endorphins) 

You can do this yourself at home, but it would be best to go to a professional first.

If you do want to try it out, run your fingers right under your collarbone. You'll may feel some tiny bumps or tenderness, and slowly massage them away (Heat is much better than pressure, so focus on warming up the area to smooth it out than brute strength.) Your pecs also attach to the sternum, so see if you can palpate anything there.

The Sternocleidomastoid is another major culprit for chest pain, since it attaches to both the clavicle and sternum. 

[Picture here](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/189659/file-28977451-png/images/sternocleidomastoid-attachments.png?t=1467831757830&width=310&height=387) 

[And another here](http://pocketdentistry.com/wp-content/uploads/285/F000047f004-001-9781437724196.jpg)

If this is shortened, it can pull your rib cage a bit out of whack. It would be on the top side of the collarbone, the top lateral (outward) edges of the sternum and the Mastoid process which is behind the ear. Though massaging this muscle can mess with the support your head has, it be best to have a professional do it while you're lying down. But once you have an idea where those muscles are attached and the procedure, I would kinda say try it for yourself. But again, I'm kinda going to school for it, so for me it's more self/preventive care rather then corrective."
440,Had to do that last night at the doctors and nearly passed out! 
441,"Not me, but I'm a nurse who works frequently with heart attack patients (for simplicity, I'm calling them heart attacks, when I mean ""myocardial infarctions"" - a blockage in one or more coronary arteries, causing heart muscle damage due to a lack of oxygen supplied by blood). The symptoms range from the very typical to really odd ones. I'd say the most common symptoms are pretty typical - a lot of chest pain (usually described as a ""heaviness"" like an elephant on the chest or a ""crushing"" or ""squeezing"", but people can have all sorts of different pains), often accompanied with symptoms like shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, and/or just generally feeling unwell and that something ""just isn't right"". Sometimes, the pain radiates to the jaw, the left arm, and/or the back, but I actually find it's less common than simply chest pain.

The most common vague symptom is definitely heartburn. Heartburn can mimic heart attacks and vice versa. I've seen people who thought they were having heartburn for days on end, when actually, they were having a heart attack (because it's not like on TV, where people suddenly clutch at their chests and keel over; such cases are usually the people who go into arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, which *can* be caused by heart attacks but not always). Usually, the key difference is the presence of other symptoms described above, but as I said, they're not always present. This is one of the reasons why it's important to get heartburn checked out if it doesn't respond to over-the-counter medications (the other side to it is that heartburn can actually do damage to your esophagus over time, so it's best to nip that in the bud in its early stages).

Lastly, I hope I don't scare anyone here, but there is also such a thing as ""silent heart attacks"", where a person is having a heart attack but there aren't any symptoms. It's more common in those with diabetes and the elderly. I once had a patient who was in hospital for a gangrenous toe (don't get diabetes, folks), and one morning, he was awake early and reading the newspaper, so I did a set of vital signs on him. To my surprise, his pulse was in the 140's (for reference, normal rate is 60-100, though we start to get worried around the 110-120 range). Called the doctor, who ordered some tests. The patient was totally calm, no pain or breathing difficulties (except for his sore toe). Turns out he was having a heart attack! He was treated for it and did fine, but sometimes I wonder what would have happened if he were sitting at home rather than in the hospital.

(**EDIT:** I am getting a few questions about the heart rate thing. I should add that heart rate alone is *not* an indicator of anything. It has to be taken in context. *Lots* of things can cause a high heart rate, from benign causes like anxiety or too much caffeine to more concerning things like a serious heart condition. One must take into consideration things like other vital signs, signs and symptoms, the patient's history, etc., to get even a decent clinical picture of what's going on. If a high heart rate can be explained, then it's not as big of a deal, either. For example, if a person is in respiratory distress, then they will have a heart rate because, well, they're struggling to breathe. As soon as you fix the respiratory issues, the heart rate should come down nicely. Also, the 110-120 range is still referring to a *resting* heart rate, and don't forget that I work in a hospital, often with patients who have co-morbidities that affect the heart's health and/or are elderly, who typically have lots of co-morbidities anyway. A young, healthy person may be able to tolerate a resting heart rate in the 110-120 range if, say, they get sick. An elderly person who has diabetes and heart disease? Yeah, not so much. A person who has just had a heart attack? Same. Their hearts just aren't able to work as hard as a young, healthy person's for prolonged periods of time. If you're young, healthy, and not sick or anxious or anything like that and your *resting* heart rate is elevated, then I wouldn't say it's a cause to panic, but you may want to get checked out by your family doctor - could be anything from anxiety to a malfunctioning thyroid to an actual problem with your heart. Again, go with your gut. If something feels *wrong* to you and you're that concerned about it, then talk to a doctor. I can't diagnose anything over the Internet...plus, I'm a nurse so I don't diagnose things in general!)

On the flip side, you can also have all the symptoms of a heart attack and even had things like electrocardiogram changes that suggest a heart attack, but in actuality, your coronary arteries don't have any blockages! (i.e. not a heart attack) An example would be [Takotsubo cardiomyopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takotsubo_cardiomyopathy) (a.k.a. Broken Heart Syndrome). I've looked after two patients with this diagnosis and it's really bizarre. Basically, the heart muscle will be injured, often due to stress (hence the name Broken Heart Syndrome - it's been known to happen after a person has lost a loved one), so we'll often see changes in the ECG, troponin level rise in the blood (often used to determine severity of a heart attack), and even indicators of heart failure. However, when an angiogram is done, there aren't any coronary artery blockages. The good news is that people generally do well after this, so long as they take care of themselves.

So basically, the heart is a very complicated organ and there is no real way to tell if there's something seriously wrong with it or not based on symptoms alone. As well, pain in the chest can be caused by so many different things, from anxiety to costocondritis to pulmonary emboli to heart attacks. Basically, if you have a concern about it, go see a doctor. Go with your gut and don't ignore symptoms that won't go away.

**LAST EDIT:** I'm getting lots of people asking me about their specific situations. As per Reddit policy (and because it's uncomfortable for me), I won't be giving medical advice to *anyone*. I can't evaluate anyone over the Internet. I'd merely be taking wild guesses, which isn't safe. If you have an actual concern about your health, please see a professional in real life, who can discuss things with you and do an examination."
442,"EMT here. I once treated a woman who was exhibiting all the classic signs of an anxiety attack, but we decided to do an EKG just in case because she was also feeling gassy. I'm glad we didn't just write her off as she requested because she was in a full-blown STEMI! Another time a family friend called me because she was just feeling a sense of doom and heaviness, like an elephant was sitting on her. I told her to call an ambulance just in case, and sure enough, it was a heart attack. 

Big ones to watch out for are difficulty breathing, feeling ""tight"" in the chest, weakness in both arms, or just feeling like something is really, really off. I always say air on the side of caution."
443,"This is an awesome question! Women have definitely been seen to have much different symptoms from men and it's so important to know about how cardiac episodes can present themselves for women vs. men.  Heart disease might not be the most popular or talked about cause, but heart disease and strokes are the cause of death of one out of every three women. 

I've been involved with the American Heart Association for years and they have a TON of resources but below are some pointers. Overall, all the survivors I've heard speak over the years typically say they experienced headaches and ""heaviness,"" but not the traditional arm tingling and crushing chest pain. It was much more subtle. 

Lastly, one of the big things we always try to hit home is it is so often that women are the last to raise their hand and recognize something is really wrong with them. We put others in front of us and think that it will just pass. One women told me she went the whole day, getting her sons to school, cooking dinner for her family, while she was suffering from a severe cardiac episode. She just didn't think it was serious enough to bother anyone with until she collapsed. 

**Signs of a Heart Attack**

- Uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain in the center of your chest. It lasts more than a few minutes, or goes away and comes back.

- Pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach.

- Shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort.

- Other signs such as breaking out in cold sweat, nausea or lightheadedness.

- Women are somewhat more likely than men to experience some of the other common symptoms, particular shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting and back or jaw pain.

**Signs of Stroke and TIAs (transient ischemic attack)**

- Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body.

- Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding.

- Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes.

- Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination.- Sudden severe headache with no known cause."
444,"My mum has had heart problems since birth. She said that with her first major heart attack she remembers working in the store then the next second she was in hospital. No real symptoms right before or anything, her boss just saw her collapse which is really frightening. Thankfully, I didn't inherit anything like that. 

Edit: also remember watching wwe once and one of the commentators had a heart attack on air.  Listened to a podcast with him and he said the same thing,  next to no symptoms apart from slight shortness of breath. "

I thought my arm was sore from carrying an 8 lb baby. the day of the baby's one week check up, I woke with cold sweat. i could breathe, but it felt like someone was sitting on my chest. went to the 9 am doc for the baby's appointment, and my husband told the receptionist that I was having chest pain. they rushed me to see a doctor right away and gave me aspirin. I felt better right away and off to the ER. I tell people to look for numbness on the left side, and chest pain during and post pregnancy. occasionally I freak out over heartburn because it felt like it, but my heart is about 99% healed :)"
446,I had a patient whose angina symptoms were jaw and teeth pain. She had originally gone to the dentist to investigate her symptoms - luckily the dentist was insightful and got her to a cardiologist. We found extremely lesioned arteries in the Cath lab; she was a walking time bomb for a heart attack.
447,"My mother had an heart attack and her only symptom was excruciating ear pain. Kid you not! Was lying on the floor, whimpering in a mix of her mother tongue and German, clutching her ears. Called our 911 equivalent, the dispatcher tried to tell me it was probably just a bad cold, buuuut if I insisted he would send somebody over. Asshole. It's 3 in the night, I wouldn't call if it didn't look really serious. "
448,"OK I am not a woman but I did have a heart attack and the symptoms were very mild.

I was already being treated for angina, high blood pressure and diabetes.

My cardiologist told me ""you know all the classic symptoms, but there are others. So if anything at all unusual starts happening? Get thee to a hospital.""

What was unusual? I was working late shift and so I got up at around 10 AM. Yawned, walked slowly to the front door and picked up the paper. Took it into the kitchen to sit, drink coffee and read the paper. I was out of breath from that tiny amount of exercise. I rested several minutes until my breathing was normal and walked slowly to the front door (16 feet) and back. Arrived out of breath. Called a cab. No drama. Take me  to emerg please. 

Checked in at the reception saying I thought I was having  a heart attack and my cardiologist said I should come here. 

They took me seriously and did some basic monitoring.They would not let me leave until they did 'something about it.'  

I left the hospital after having a quintuple bypass a couple weeks later."
449,"My late father went to his doctor to complain about heartburn.  One test led to another.  Both his carotid and pulmonary arteries were almost completely blocked.  Right at that appointment the doctor got him an appointment for bypass surgery in a week.   I learned in the hospital that he had earlier had a ""silent heart attack"".

A very fit friend of mine in her 30s who ate a vegan diet went to a health fair that had some sort of portable scanner that revealed her carotid artery had a LOT of plaque buildup on it.

Turns out she is one of those people with genetics that despite a great lifestyle, still needed statins.

Bottom line, have regular checkups with a thorough doctor.   You just don't know what could be going on inside of you."
450,"Ex-boyfriend had two heart attacks in his 20's,  physically fit with no family history of heart disease.  He smoked and drank and certainly didn't eat the healthiest, but also played soccer several times a week and was in pretty decent shape.

He had heartburn, chest pain, vomiting, cold sweats, shortness of breath and was very pale.  I honestly thought it was heat stroke, it was very hot that day and he had just played soccer maybe an hour earlier, but I suppose he sensed it was something worse and so I drove him to the ER.   They did the ecg and took him back almost immediately, it was a 100% blockage of his right coronary artery and he had an angioplasty and stent put in.   Huge life change for him that he had a really hard time accepting and adjusting to - sort of caused the second heart attack himself, by not being diligent with his meds and we knew right away to call an ambulance that time."
451,"My mother had throbbing jaw discomfort for months before she experienced full cardiac arrest.  She brought this up with her dentist and GP, but neither could find anything wrong.  About a month and a half before the heart attack, she had an EKG done to make sure she was clear to go on this big trip that she and my dad planned for overseas, and it showed no abnormalities.  She had also lost ~60 lbs over the previous 18 months in preparation for this trip, which involved a whole lot of walking.

The day or two before the heart attack, she experienced higher-than-usual fatigue and some heartburn (I think?), but nothing that was out of the ordinary for her, especially with the  leukemia drugs that she takes.  Then, at about 11:30 on a Tuesday night four years ago, she just dropped clinically dead on the kitchen floor with a full blockage of one of her arteries.

I was able to intervene almost immediately with CPR until the EMTs arrived and (eventually) successfully defibrilated her.  We've been very lucky that she's made a very substantial recovery.  While she has considerably diminished cardiac capacity, she did not suffer any other major organ damage and, while somewhat frail, she's a fully-functioning 55-year-old."
452,"Sorry this is long.

That last bit--Broken Heart Syndrome--I had something similar but no broken heart.  10 years ago, I was in law school, my dad died, and I was becoming hypothyroid (undiagnosed another years).  So *everything* was stressing, and my bp was good if it was under 145/100.  This was for over a year.

Having chest pains, I was sent to a cardiologist.  He asked me to describe my pain; I described six distinct types of pains: weight on chest, like a tight band; pain under the sternum; pain up to my jaw; sharp pains (like nails being pounded in) just left of center on my chest; dull aches that had me grabbing at my chest; and the worst one--lasting pain like someone shoved a pipe through my chest and it was coming out my back.  Oh, and though it's just an indicator of inflammation *somewhere*, a CRP over 20.  I'd had years of heartburn; an endoscopy showed NO esophageal issues.

The cardiologist's mouth literally dropped open on that last bit, husband said it was because that was ""classic heart attack"" and I said I'd felt it 8 or 9 times.  EKG was clear--they've always been just fine since, too.  First stress test was ""inconclusive.""  Two years later, the second one was, too.  I also had a massive x-ray, had to go to San Francisco for that--no *major* problem found, calcification somewhere between 0 and 50%, so not really helpful.  Oh, and an ultrasound, and some other test I can't remember.  All that was found found was that my heart was a bit larger than expected, but not unduly so, and no thickening of the walls.  I was told that I could ""buy green bananas""--I'd be alive to eat them when ripe, if you didn't figure that out.

Finished law school, got thyroid dosage right (that took a couple of years), and with that find, I passed the Bar the second time.  Stress down, as I was not working.  When I had pain suddenly, I insisted on an angiogram, based on that pain, my history, and family history (father had blockage but his body had made its own diversions around it).  

I had NO significant blockage of ANY kind.  At age 50, my arteries weren't perfect, but we're about as good as a 25yo.  NO damage to my heart muscle.  CRP still won't come down.  

**tl;dr**:  So not all chest pain means a heart attack, but it pays to be cautious, right?"
453,">Lastly, I hope I don't scare anyone here, but there is also such a thing as ""silent heart attacks"", where a person is having a heart attack but there aren't any symptoms. It's more common in those with diabetes and the elderly. 

I'd also note they are more common in women over 40 then men. I can find a source if desired. "
454,"I'm in my early 30s, heart disease runs in my family. I went to the ER a few weekends ago with chest pains thinking it was severe heartburn. Turns out it was angina(?). The symptoms I had were chest pains like someone was pressing heavily in the center of my chest and slight shortness of breath. They did chest xrays, CT scan  and EKG. Everything came back fine. What did show up to be abnormal were my triponin levels. After being discharged from the hospital the next day, I scheduled a stress test, which came back normal, and then an echocardiogram which also came back normal. The doctor said this was an anomaly, but put me on an Aspirin regimen and I have to get yearly checkups due to my family history. The doctor said I may not exhibit symptoms for days, months or years from now but also to have my blood pressure checked regularly. Moral of the story; Don't ignore chest pains, people."
455,"So once your pulse is around 140 bpm, you should be concerned it's a heart attack?  

My heart rate sometimes spikes for 2-30 minutes and I get lightheaded.  I was referred to a cardiologist for basic tests (a heart monitor), where they confirmed my heart rate spikes, usually to 115-125 bpm.  They sent me back to my GP who shrugged about it and said to come back another time, and go to the ER if it gets worse.

No one will tell me what 'worse' actually means, though.  I have absolutely no idea what warrants a trip to the ER.  Since you mentioned 140bpm, is that around the time I should consider going to the ER?  I know you can't really give me medical advice based off of a random reddit comment, but if I could get some not completely vague guidelines for when I should be concerned, that would be *amazing*.  "
456,"Thank you for this. I lost several important women in my life to heart attacks in their 40's and 50's, and I'd never heard of women having much risk for them prior to that. Being about to turn 40 myself, and with a family history of heart disease, this is good information to be aware of."

458,"Absolutely! No decent doctor worth his/her salt would turn away a patient who was complaining of chest pain. If all tests come back normal, then it's just a relief for all parties involved. So, yeah, it's always worth getting it checked out :) No one will laugh at you or think any less of you."
459,"Heart rate alone isn't really an indicator of anything in particular. Lots of people with heart attacks come in with heart rates within normal range. On the other hand, you can have people having anxiety attacks (scary for the person, of course, but not life threatening) with very high heart rates. So, yeah, heart rate has to be taken within context and in conjunction with many other things, like other vital signs, the patient's presentation, and other signs and symptoms (and, of course, other diagnostic tests if needed, like blood work or ECGs)."
460,"No not necessarily. A high heart rate could be a result of many things. If it's not accompanied by chest pain or any other symptom of a heart attack, I'd think of other possibilities first. Also (almost - 2 months away) a nurse. 
If you have a high heart rate, start to get dizzy, short of breath, feel it pounding in your chest or fluttering, have chest, jaw, back or arm pain - that's when you should go to the ER. 

I personally have inappropriate sinus tachycardia, which basically means my heart rate is around 120 when I'm at rest. It's totally benign for me. "
461,"I should really put a note on that...

110-120 is in context, and I meant that as a *resting* heart rate. Heart rate alone *does not mean anything* and other things - like other vital signs, signs and symptoms, history, etc. - must be taken into consideration to interpret what a heart rate means in a clinical sense.

Your resting heart rate is about 80, which falls within normal range. Remember, I work in a hospital with ill patients, usually an older population (i.e. age 60+), and most patients I see aren't typically the healthiest of people (i.e. typically have at least one co-morbidity, such as smoking, diabetes, COPD, cardiac disease of some sort, etc.). Where I work specifically - cardiology - if the heart has already sustained damage because of, say, a heart attack, then we do try to keep the resting heart rate below 90. Anything higher means the heart must work harder, which is like making an injured person run a race.

If you're young, otherwise healthy, and have no symptoms, it's likely not too worrying. I've had young patients come in for things like infections or uncontrolled blood sugars (type 1 diabetics), and the doctors are fine with them having heart rates in the 120's because they're young and can compensate for that fast a rate (and there's an obvious explanation for it). A person in their 80's who has multiple co-morbidities? Yeah, their bodies just aren't as capable of compensating for as long.

Obviously, I can't diagnose anything over the Internet, but if your heart is beating fast with just ""any movement"" and you have no symptoms but is normal at rest, I'd hazard a guess that you may want to work on your cardio exercises if you aren't already? If you're physically fit, though, then I honestly have no idea and someone would have to actually evaluate you in person."
462,"I am a substitute teacher, so my days follow similar patterns, but aren't ever quite the same. I'm in several districts so my day starts anywhere from 7:05 to 8:50 am. I try to get to school fifteen to twenty minutes early so I can open up my classroom, read through the plans the teacher left, find a fridge for my lunch, check the teacher's mailbox, and go pee, because gods know when I'll have time for that again... 

I work in schools where I usually either have kids for 5 of 7 or 6 of 8 classes that are about fifty minutes long or 3 out of 4 ninety minute classes. Oftentimes I'll have ""coverage"" during prep times because basically every school is short on subs and I don't have anything to prep, so I'll spend my extra period(s) covering for other teachers that are out but didn't get their own sub. 

Class always starts with introducing myself, taking roll, and introducing the  work left for us by the teacher. While kids are working I'm around the classroom answering questions, keeping kids on task, confiscating cellphones, and/or praising the kids who aren't being pains in my bum. Repeat 3-5x per day, depending on schedule. 

The kids and classrooms are often new to me. Teachers don't have / use enough sick days that I get to be in the same class more than twice very often, though I am pretty consistent in the schools I go to.

I usually spend lunch schmoozing and prep cleaning / organizing. I normally get to leave between 2:30 and 4 pm. 
"
463,"Also a registered nurse!

I work primarily within the realm of cardiology in a critical care setting (the only thing we do not do that ICU can is anything involving care of an intubated patient; we simply lack the resources for that). What we see are mostly heart attacks, people who require urgent pacemakers due to symptomatic bradycardia/AV block, those with deadly arrhythmias (such as ventricular tachycardia), and the really bad heart failure patients (usually requiring BiPap and/or inotropes). We sometimes get internal medicine patients who are very sick (i.e. diabetic ketoacidosis, really bad COPD exacerbations, drug overdoses), but they're the minority. I work 12 hour shifts and, within that timeframe, things can change rapidly. We once went from coasting along to having to code two patients at once.

Basically, my day starts off with getting my assignment and receiving report. I sit down, interpret my ECG strips, and go over what medications I have to give that day. I also mentally sort what I need to do during my shift - for example, if any of my patients need to go for tests or require dressing changes. Then I go assess my patients, usually starting with the most unstable if there is one in my assignment. After assessments, I try to fit in a bit of charting, then go around and give out my medications.

After that is anyone's guess what happens! I do more charting, answer call bells, give out medications, do some more charting, round with the doctor when he/she arrives, process doctors' orders, more charting, periodically interpret/record ECG strips, respond to any changes in my patients' conditions, update charge nurse of anything major going on, help out my co-workers if I'm able, and of course, do more charting. I always have a rough idea of when I should get things done, but like I said, things can change rapidly, so I mostly play things by ear."
464,"I'm a physical therapist (in Europe so things may differ compared to the US). I work at a hospital in outpatient rehabilitation from 8 am to 4 pm and have either a half an hour or an hour with each patient (10 patients a day on average) in a room that I don't have to share with my colleagues.

My patients (all ages) have all kinds of problems while chronic (low back) pain being the most common. I mainly choose active methods over passive ones so most of the work is done by my patients, but I like to exercise together with back and neck pain patients.

I also do group therapy on some days and teach an exercise class for the elderly twice a month at the same hospital, so my work days vary a bit."
465,"I own a preloved fashion market event and do freelance work. A typical day is me sitting in PJ's listening to music convincing myself to work for two hours, eating ramen for an hour and watch youtube, 4 more hour of convinced work, followed by 2 hours of computer games and drinking wine until I pass out"
466,"Phlebotomist here. Learning to draw blood can be very intimidating. I was actually terrified because I hate having my blood drawn (prone to fainting), and knew that students would practice on each other. But honestly, it's very rewarding in the sense that once you start to get it, and to do it well consistently, your confidence skyrockets. My situation is a little different than maybe some others who draw blood at work, in that all I do is draw blood. I'm not an MA or anything else, only a certified phlebotomist. This means that I was able to get very good at it very quickly (I draw anywhere from 40-150 patients per week as a part-time employee, whereas nurses or MAs, etc. may only draw that many people in 2-4 weeks). As such, I've had many patients who come to where I work and warn me that at the hospital, they had to be drawn by the head nurse or even the anesthesiologist - and I (and any of my coworkers) am able to draw them on the first try with no trouble. Just one of those things. It's fun, though."
467,"I've seen a lot of women having heart attacks and they have all displayed the typical ""classic"" heart attack signs and symptoms.  They describe crushing, squeezing, or heavy pain in the center of their chest, often shortness of breath, pain radiation to the jaw or L arm, and they have all had an intense sense of fear/impending doom.  

There is always the possibility of having an atypical presentation though, such as nausea which won't go away, ""not feeling right"", and abnormal weakness/fatigue.  These types of symptoms are more common in the elderly/diabetic community. 

If you have a strong history of heart disease in your family, you can ask your primary care doctor to refer you to a cardiologist so you can get a cardiac stress test (walking/running on a treadmill hooked up to an EKG).  The entire test takes about an hour and can help see if there's any signs that suggest heart disease.  "
468,"Do you see a cardiologist? I think that would be the best person to talk to about what symptoms you should pay attention to and what you can safely ignore.

My dad had a heart attack last summer. He had chest pain, and his dad died of a heart attack, so he went to the hospital. Lucky him, because he was in the hospital with a cardiologist present when he actually had the heart attack. They were able to act very quickly, and that's probably why he didn't suffer any permanent damage. He has recovered fully.

The moral of that story being, consult a professional and do not screw around."
469,"If you're worried about breast cancer or heart attacks then you'll need to keep a watch out for signs and signals. Grab a card from your doctor about how to give yourself a breast exam and hang it in the shower (Just a simple lump test). You can check every day, or once a week. Whatever makes you feel comfortable.

While classic heart attack symptoms do occur, studies directed towards women's health show that they may not be present at all with heart attack in women. It may be helpful to familiarize yourself with both sets of symptoms.

I wouldn't be afraid to talk with specialists in both areas to discuss what your options are for prevention, and what steps you need to take as you get older. My family has numerous breast cancer survivors and two members who suffered from heart attacks. It will definitely ease your mind to know as much as you can. "
470,My sister had a heart attack.  She didn't experience *any* symptoms other than blanching.  Luckily she was in the hospital at the time (visiting) and a nurse asked her if she felt alright and then they started doing the tests or whatever it is you do to diagnose a heart attack. 
471,"What do you do? I did have an EKG and stress test done a few years ago (as well as an ultrasound of my heart). The EKG showed bradycardia. Stress test was fine. The mitral valve is allowing some blood to regurgitate which showed up on the ultrasound but the cardiologist wasn't concerned about it.

I keep reading that women have atypical symptoms so I was curious."
472,"I wish you the best and a complete recovery. And you know, it's never too late--as long as you're living--to take charge of your health. My mom didn't begin exercising and eating better until after her heart attack a couple years ago. Since then, she hired a trainer at a gym and went on a diet. She has dropped a LOT of weight and several sizes--she looks better than I ever remember! And she is 67."
473,"How old was your sister when she had the heart attack? I guess if you're gonna have one, it's better to already be in a hospital. Was she under a lot of stress at the time?"
474,"That is really interesting about the sense of doom! That's not something I've ever seen listed under symptoms..

I have acid reflux and am used to my reflux, but a few years ago I had very unusual chest pain and began having a panic attack when it didn't go away. Went to the ER, they ran some tests to make sure I wasn't dying then sent me home with a dx of heartburn. 

I felt a little silly but better safe than sorry."
475,"It was scary.  I actually had a series of four to five in 24 hours.  I  had never had any previous cardiac issues.  I was only 43 at the time, and I quite suddenly became nauseous and sweaty while showering.  I tried to finish up my shower and couldn’t.  I collapsed into my bed soaking wet and starting experiencing pain under my left breast, wrapping around my side to the back, my left shoulder up the left side of my neck.  I was shaking and my heart rate was high (I was able to have my son grab a pulse oximeter).  My poor teenage boys had to call an ambulance, and they were literally going to send me home from the ER because all the tests were coming back fine.  The only thing that caught it was my troponin levels increased-that’s how they knew heart damage had occurred.  It was labeled NSTEMI.  We never did find the cause-it wasn’t due to a blockage, so the doctors attributed it to an arrhythmia.  They haven’t found the arrhythmia problem to this day, I’m not on any blood thinners, and the cardiac doctors have given me a clean bill of health.  I still get concerned whenever I start getting hot/sweaty/nauseous at all, since I would have never expected those to be associated with having a heart attack, especially in my forties.  I hope this answers your question."
476,"OMD totally scary 

I was on campus when it happened.  Buying breakfast before class, when suddenly I had a hard time breathing.  It was like the air was too warm to breathe.  I collected my breakfast, put it in my bag and quickly took my stuff to the first aid room.  I then collapsed on the floor, took my jacket, scarf, hoodie and hat off, and security called for first aid.  They called the ambulance who thought it was either asthma, acid reflux, anxiety, or an allergic reaction.  We decided to go to the hospital.  They took an EKG and said something isn't right.  Immediately to the trauma bay and this point onwards is a bit of a blur in my memory.  But they transferred me to another hospital.  They took me to the Cath Lab and put a stent in my artery via my wrist.  It was incredibly painful.  There was also something heavy on my chest. The pain from the heart attack combined with whatever heavy item was on my chest, made me feel really nauseous and unwell.  After surgery, I was in the hospital for 6 days.  I couldn't move my wrist for 24 hours, and an IV line was put in my other arm, so I couldn't move that either.  My parents had to help me with meals because of both arms being immovable.  I also hadn't eaten since the night before because my breakfast was still in my bag.  I was the youngest on the ward.  This was 2 months ago.  And I am still learning how to deal with it day by day.  I have 5 new meds to take.  I gotta check my weight everyday, and my blood pressure, and heart rate have to be monitored.  I got a Fitbit to monitor my heart rate since the clinics are closed.  I have since been diagnosed with a condition called SCAD which is the cause of my heart attack."
477,"I had my first one at 18 years old. My entire left side went numb, I became extremely dizzy, disoriented, cold sweats and nauseated. I went to the hospital and was told my troponin levels were elevated and I likely experienced a ""heart related event."" I was never told it was a 'heart attack' but it was more likely a 'transient ischemic attack.' In any case, both of those events are centered around the inability to get oxygen normally to a part of the body (brain/heart/lungs) due to a clot or other vascular issue. I was given no meds, not asked to stay for observation, nothing.

The wildest thing to me is that at that time, it was well-known that I was having issues with my energy/tiredness due to my heart condition. I had surgery as a baby and needed surgery less than a year after this even to close an atrial septal defect in the middle of the atria of my heart that had gotten to be 15 mm wide.

I do not think women are taken as seriously as men when it comes to heart attacks. Men have symptoms that are more ""textbook"" while women definitely do not. But when your heart is fucking up, boy can you tell. Whether you're a man or a woman. I have since learned to advocated for my own health - its easy to do when you have a chronic heart condition from birth."
478,"I think it is important for women to share symptoms because they are often atypical. I never experienced any pain but woke up feeling incredibly dizzy with an extremely cold feeling inside my chest. Lots of heart issues in my family so I called for an ambulance at 6:30 a.m. By 10:00 I was in open heart surgery for a quadruple bypass. Apparently I had a heart attack on the table but because they had already started I survived. Had I been at home at the time I probably would not have made it to the hospital. I now eat a plant based diet, exercise regularly and feel great two years post surgery."
479,"I don't know. I didn't realize that I had one until having tests done afterwards that showed there was damage from it. I did not have the traditional symptoms and did not recognize it as a heart attack while it was occurring. I've always had a couple of heart conditions, so I'm used to feeling the effects from those, but it must not have presented that way at the time."
480,"I was 32, a Kindergarten teacher. It was 1995. I’d been taking a triptan drug for migraine headaches for a couple of years. This one particular occasion, a few hours after I took the tablet, I began to feel terrible pressure in my chest and up into the left side of my jaw. I honestly thought it was indigestion at first and chewed some antacid tablets. The pressure and feeling of panic grew. I called my parents. They got me and drove me to the local ER. 

It was set up with a “triage” nurse at a desk where you came in. The nurse wrote down your symptoms and sent your name to the back. You were told to go to the waiting area and wait until a nurse came out and called your name. 

So, I went to the desk and said I was having chest pains and was starting to feel nauseated. The nurse looked at me and said, “Well, you’re not having a heart attack. Go sit over there and wait for someone to call you.” We sat down. I remember that I started sweating and I was moaning as the pain in my chest intensified. It was very crowded, children crying, noise, smells...we’d been waiting over an hour when I found myself suddenly on my hands and knees puking on some random guy’s foot. 

Just at that moment one of the ER nurses came out from the treatment area to call the next patient and saw me. Turns out she was the mother of one of my students. She rushed me to the back, heard the words “chest pain” and had the doctor, an IV, nitro, EKG all inside 15 minutes. 

I was in the ICU for 2 days, had a cardiac cath, and stress test. It was determined that I had no blockage or other cardiac disease. However, the triptan migraine drug had caused me to have spasms in my coronary artery. They were severe enough to cause a myocardial infarction that left me with moderate heart damage."
481,"Not me, but my mother. A few weeks ago, my mother decided to go out and hang out with her friend. That night, I was surprised that I didn't get a goodnight text or any of the sort as she would always either call me or text me. I thought nothing of it as she probably fell asleep. The next morning, I noticed how my mother wasn't home. Once again, I thought nothing of it and that she probably wanted to spend more time with her friend. 

The next day, I was starting to get worried until she called me. She said that she was in the hospital, and that she ended up getting a heart attack. I gave my step father the phone as she wanted to talk to him, and he didn't even believe her. He truly didn't believe that my mother was in the hospital and just passed it off as ""trying to start an argument."" It took nearly an hour for him to realize that my mother was serious as he could hear one of the machines through the phone. I had to stay away from my step father that weekend as I would have cursed him out for that. 

Two days later, we picked my mother up from the hospital, and we learned that she was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. During the time at home, she always said how her shoulder hurts, and I had to massage it time to time. She also had many dark bruises on her arms. A few weeks later she is doing fine. Her shoulder still hurts but it's getting better. I'm just happy that she's here with me.

Edit: Fixed some typos"
482,"My mum had a heart attack at 51.  She had struggled with heart burn for years anyway, so when she had those feelings she wasn’t too concerned.  She woke up in the night and was vomiting and my dad went to help her.  He said that she went all floppy and clammy and very pale.  My dad was in the army for 24 years and he’s had some medical training so he guessed she was having a heart attack and called 999 immediately.  My mum didn’t even want him to call the ambulance because she didn’t think it could be that serious. 

When they arrived they did tests and said that she had had a heart attack.  She was denying it even to the paramedics! I don’t know the exact details of it but she had a blockage and they removed it by going through her vein and into her artery (again, I don’t know the exact details).  She had smoked since she was 15 so she quit straight away and cleaned up her diet, as well as going on several medications.  4 years later and she’s fine! She was also diagnosed as pre-diabetic but she’s managed to control that.

I wasn’t actually there for any of this because this took place during my first year at uni.  But yeah, even my mum, in the midst of a heart attack, was denying that she was having a heart attack.  Medical advice is so clearly aimed at men, and it could have cost my mum her life if my dad hadn’t been there and acted on his instinct and knowledge."
483,"As someone with PTSD related to ""feeling heart attacks"", I don't think I'll ever know the difference between them and my panic attacks."
484,"My mother died from a “widow maker” heart attack. The left anterior descending artery was 90% occluded when they did the autopsy. She had been complaining of issues off and on but kept writing them off as something else. The morning she died and the night before she had complained of nausea. The ER doctor told us she most likely was having a heart attack for hours and didn’t realize it. I was not with her when she died. 

Now whenever I feel suddenly nauseous I panic."
485,"suffered a heart attack one week after i gave birth. had a sudden coronary artery dissection (SCAD) due to pregnancy. i had no clue pregnancy increases the risk of a heart attack! i was in ICU for a week, had a cardiac catheterization, and they found the torn artery. i was 28 with normal weight, no drinking and smoking, and no medical history. was put on coumadin (blood thinner) for a month. the worst part was pumping my breast milk and throwing them out. after a month of normal healing, they decided that i was pretty much back to normal (95%). now 13 years later, life is fairly uneventful. i just couldn’t do major exercises (heart rate no higher than 130). i was supposed to see a cardiologist every year but life happened. until three years ago, i was diagnosed with breast cancer. now i see a cardiologist every year. once i’m off tamoxifen (for the cancer), i’ll resume daily baby aspirin"
486,"Mom had sort of the same thing. We took her to the ER and they said she didn’t have any signs, but because it’s a rural hospital they sent her to the city. They said her triponin (sp?) started out really low, but kept increasing.

The first cardiologist said they “might” have to put 1 maybe 2 stents in, but once they started doing the procedure realized she needed quadruple bypass surgery."
487,"Dang, the beginning of this sounded like my hot flashes with perimenopause... until you mentioned the pain. 

I have a 30% blockage in the left main artery (widowmaker). Before they found out how mild it actually was, I was 2 DAYS from a double bypass surgery.  I was freaking terrified at 48 years old. Dx with PTSD not long after that hospital stay.  I take my cholesterol medication & calcium blockers religiously now. I try to eat better & take my supplements. Exercise with my other health issues is difficult, but I love to walk."
488,"How high was your heart rate? I'm always worried I'll ignore signs of a heart attack because I have hEDS and POTS, which causes regular pain in my chest, ribs, shoulders, arms, neck and back along with a very high heart rate most of the time."
489,"This is so frustrating. It’s been very well known in science now that heart attacks in women are fairly different than in men. And a lot of doctors still are not paying enough attention on this matter.

I’m sorry to hear you didn’t get that treatment you deserve! I hope you are in better health now! Please in doubt go to a doctor! You know what you feel!!"
490,"My story is very similar but I had a stroke at 27.   Luckily my cardiologist was European and took it more seriously than the American doctors (I’m in the US).  We will just say the heart defect was more widely recognized and understood in Europe and covered by insurance where in the US it’s a battle to get it done.   After lots of heart issues they closed the hole in my heart as well.  My cardiologist told the people who deal with insurance that I was likely to have additional more severe strokes, so it was a “cheaper” preventative measure.  My energy level, stress, migraines, everything improved so drastically.  Seriously a whole new life."
491,"It's sort of infuriating that the signs of both a heart attack and an anxiety attack are largely the same for women, and we don't always know if it's the former until it's dangerously past when we should be getting help. I'm so happy you survived!"
492,"I read heart attacks in women tend to have different symptoms than men's, so the publicized symptoms don't often match Women's heart attacks. What was your experience?"
493,"The same thing happened to me-- they found heart damage on an EKG while doing a routine pre-surgery check. I was only 29 so it was pretty odd...

Stress tests showed nothing of note. Heart is perfectly functional otherwise so we went ahead with surgery. I can't recall any time where I experienced any cardiac symptoms (including the ""atypical"" ones women get) so I really do wonder. The cardiologist suggested it might be also be congenital damage or a weird placement thing. I don't have any trouble with exercise or any day to day things so the doctors told me not to worry."
494,Wow! It's really great your doctor figured it out. I have POTS and EDS too and this is my worst fear--how will I tell my normal symptoms from a heart attack?
495,"Omg. ""Well, you're not having a heart attack"" YIKES. I hope that nurse rethought **that** one after what happened."
496,Which triptan??? I know this was 1995 but I’m so concerned. I have migraines and my mother died of a heart attack in 2014 at 67.
497,"Hi there! At 16, unless you have a pretty serious congenital heart issue, it’s almost unheard of to have a heart attack. It takes time for arteriosclerosis to build up in your blood vessels and cause a blockage, and it’s very unlikely to happen by the time you’re 16. It’s possible that you have another cardiac issue, such as an arrhythmia, but what is much more likely is anxiety attacks. They’re extremely common and can mimic a lot of the symptoms of a heart attack (ie. difficulty breathing, chest pain, shaking, sweating, nausea, headache, etc.). I suspect that’s probably why your doctor said ‘it’s nothing’ in response to your symptoms. They can feel like you’re dying but have no lasting effects, so it’s hard for medical professionals to detect them once they’re over."
498,"Thank you so much, a definite bump on my life journey I was not expecting at my age for sure, but appreciating listening to baby birds outside my window at 7am now 💜. Always a positive in the negatives if you look. I think its the whole numb left arm etc, seemingly a lot of women dont get that, and it's the symptom most people ""look"" for in association with a heart attack. So we do tend to ""brush off"" major signs and symptoms until it's at crisis point unfortunately."
499,"I'm not a doctor, in any shape or form but I'd think, purely from my experience, you would know if you had a heart attack. I get anxiety pretty bad and have done for years but there was literally a period of probably not even 2 hours between what I thought could've been really bad anxiety and realising that something was seriously wrong, and I now have a metal stent in my heart keeping one of my very much needed valves open, which I'm told stopped the pain and feelings I had. Not a ""feeling"" I ever want to experience again, but very quickly becomes obvious it's not just anxiety/attack and didnt go away at all for me, so I wouldn't worry too much but most definitely speak to your doctor and explain your worries, and a simple test should hopefully be able to put your mind at ease. I'm hoping I'm helping more than hindering here"
500,"That's correct, and one reason why women are more likely to not survive. Research on heart attacks was conducted on men, and it's only recently that these differences are being discussed. 

This situation extends to many, many other areas of life, from medication dosage recommendations, to seatbelt placement."
501,"It really varies person to person. I've seen both classic (Crushing chest pain with and without radiation to other parts of the body) and non classic (Dizzy, Nausea/ Vomiting, Flu like symptoms) from both genders. I think because a heart attack can have such vague symptoms is why almost all ER patients now get an EKG and at least 1 troponin level done. 

Not so fun fact: uncontrolled diabetes can damage nerves enough that your body doesn't receive the ""Chest pain announcement"" and is one of the many reasons practitioners push so hard to keep diabetes under control."
502,To be fair she was also 14. It’s not common at all for teens to get heart attacks which is likely why they said it was probably nothing
503,"This reminds me of the Grey's Anatomy episode when Dr. Bailey had a heart attack. 

As women we have to know that symptoms for a heart attack are different than for men.

504,"This comment has scared me. A few months ago before christmas I woke up in the middle of the night suddenly feeling very sick, I ran to the bathroom, my temp suddenly spiked, I went dizzy and passed out on the bathroom floor. When I woke up, I felt tired but better, not sick anymore just had a bit of a headache that didn't pass for a couple of days, I never went to the doctors because i put it down to being a migraine as I do get them but never like that. There is a history of heart trouble in my family, my dad passed from it before his 40th birthday and I am 36 now. Obviously doctors have other things on their plate to deal with now so I won't be going until it happens again but at least I know the signs now."
505,"I don’t know- I took a shower before and the whole time I was thinking is this a heart attack or am I just worrying? Lmao.

SUCKS"
506,"The first doctor was female, and wasn't really interested in what I had to say. I'm in the UK so I use the NHS, and from personal experience I'd say the system as a whole isn't really interested. I do have a male doctor now who's a lot more friendly than the previous one, so funnily enough I actually think he'd pay more attention to me.

I realise where you're coming from and I do appreciate the concern, but at the same time I'm not dead yet and I suspect that if they were actual heart attacks I'd be dead by now. They're certainly worrying, but a) I can't really get to the doctors because of the pandemic and b) I don't want to find out I have a heart condition in case it precludes me from entering my career of choice."
507,"Hey, I'm in the UK, I'm about ten years older than you but I have some experience with similar issues.

If you're worried that you're in an emergency situation with your symptoms, please do call an ambulance or get someone to take you to A&E. They will look after you. About three years ago I started getting horrible chest pains, sweating, dizziness. I was young and healthy and there were no risk factors. But I went to A&E because it was bloody terrifying. They couldn't find anything wrong, but said its good that I came because it's better safe than sorry with chest pain. This happened twice more, and I got diagnosed with costochondritis - but the important thing is, each time I was reassured that I did the right thing by going to the hospital. Yes, they don't like people wasting time, but by that they mean ""don't come in for a papercut"" - things you are genuinely worried about are 100% OK to go in with."
508,"I know many have commented about anxiety but I had a very similar thing happen when I was 16 and there were multiple times I was 100% convinced I was having a heart attack. Idk how many times my mom rushed me to the ER and the countless appointments we went to for everything to come back normal. Turns out it was anxiety, and I had no idea because I didn’t “feel” anxious at the time. 
Not saying what you’ve got going on IS anxiety, but just keep an open mind because even if you’re not feeling anxious or don’t think anything anxiety-inducing has happened, anxiety attacks can still get ya! 

Also, I was diagnosed with some sort of somatic personality disorder (I forget the name, just remember it had somatic in it, bc that was literally 15 years ago and after therapy I managed to “fix” it for the most part, although on rare occasions I’ll catch myself doing it) - when I get super emotional (whether it’s anger/sadness/fear) instead of “feeling” that emotion like most people do, I manifest it into physical symptoms. A lot of times I wouldn’t realize I was angry/upset/whatever, I’d just get the physical symptom and be like wtf is wrong with my body. 

It’s not unheard of to be young and have a heart condition, my brother had lots of chest pain/heart attack feelings and found out that while he does, in fact, have anxiety, he also has a valve issue that causes some of the chest pain. Just keep an open mind though, like I said, anxiety/other issues can still be a problem even if you don’t feel anxious/whatever emotion when it’s happening!"
509,"Thanks, I notice I've been down voted a few times for saying I don't think it's anxiety but I really do appreciate all the input I'm getting. It's possible it's anxiety, as I've said I really don't know a lot about it so I'll have to do some research.

Yeah, I have a friend who had to have open heart surgery when he was about 12/13 for a valve issue that meant he fainted whenever he got too excited. I don't think it's necessarily something like that, but where I don't know a lot about anxiety I know even less about heart conditions. Considering I've been having this on and off for 2 years now, I don't know why I've never really looked into potential causes. At the end of the day, I think it's down to my somewhat cavalier approach to my health. If I'm not dying, it's not a problem, and if I am dying well it'll happen sooner or later so it's still not a massive problem in my eyes. Maybe a cynical approach, potentially even a worrying one if I'm honest, but I've never been too bothered about the idea of my own death."
510,"I’ve been dealing with stomach pain for the past year.  Had an endoscopy, came back ok.  Had a HIDA scan, also ok.  My first gastroenterologist thought my anxiety could be the cause.  Got a therapist, started back on anxiety meds, feel pretty good anxiety wise.  Stomach pain still there.  Got a new doctor who I just met with last week over telemedicine.  Doctor suspects functional dyspepsia but admits that diagnosis can refer to a wide range of things.  I am now taking Nexium for a few month to see if that helps get everything to calm down.  

It sucks, I feel like there isn’t a good answer to help with this.  My stomach hurts literally every day, just varying degrees.  I’ve accepted it more lately but sometimes it just knocks me out.  I’ve tried so many different things: DGL, zantac, Pepcid, FDgard (this might have helped a little but is super expensive), Prilosec (never for more than one month so doctor now wants me to try PPI for several months), marshmallow root.  The closest thing that came to helping especially with the heartburn was Gaviscon Advance (UK formula) but it’s made with an artificial sweetener and that was starting to hurt my stomach.

If the Nexium doesn’t work, I’m ready to do a complete overhaul of my diet.  I did try to eat better and that sometimes helps, but then I can eat something healthy like a salad that usually doesn’t bother me and it will.  It doesn’t seem like there is any rhyme or reason to what hurts me and what is ok.

Editing to add my symptoms:  upper abdominal pain, chest pain, chest soreness almost every morning, throat pain, sometimes back and pain in the right upper quadrant, post nasal drip, regurgitation, burping, and bloating.  Sometimes nausea but that’s settled down a bit at least."
511,"I ha e been battling this since Sept of last year. Non-stop burping, all day long. I get chest tightness when gas is stuck and upper chest pain that radiates into my shoulders and jaw. I've actually gone to the ER a few times concerned it was a heart attack, but all my test came back negative. Finally referred to GI where a scope came back negative and my HIDA scan was abnormal. Had my gallbladder removed in Jan. Still no relief. Then they diagnosed functional dyspepsia. Gave me some amitriptyline and said to eat using the FODMAP diet. Just like amanda290727, I cannot narrow down my symptoms to a particular trigger food. I can eat plain skinless chicken just fine for a week and the next week be miserable by it. It's awful! I am now seeing a functional medicine doctor who started some supplements this week and did a large comprehensive stool exam. Hoping to have some answers when the results are back in 3-4 weeks."
512,"Not me, but my mom had one at 45. We've talked a lot about it and what if felt like, for her. 

The first time she felt like something was wrong, we were having a huge fight. I said something shitty, and instead of reprimanding or even yelling back she just sat on the couch. She said she felt out of breath, and like her arms had just turned to lead. I wanted to call 911 but she was ADAMANT that she was fine. 

Fast forward a few weeks, she's been exhausted. She's missed so much work because she's ready to nap by 2pm, and needs to go home. She hasn't felt heavy and leaden since that night, but her chest and back felt really tight. After 3 weeks of feeling like this, she finally went to a hospital. Turns out she had a ""serious cardiac event"" and needed a stent put in. She was hospitalized for about a week. 

She said it never felt painful or sharp, and it didn't feel sudden like in movies. One day she was able to run up a flight of stairs and cook dinner, and the next day she needed to nap by 2pm and couldn't handle walking for 10 minutes without a rest. She thought she was either pregnant again or had mono. "
513,"I haven't had a heart attack, but since these stories are being shared I wanted to note the difference between cardiac arrest and a heart attack. My father had a heart attack without going into arrest and somehow this wasn't communicated to my brother or me so we didn't fully grasp what was happening, and I've since heard many people dismiss their symptoms because they don't match a movie scenario.

Below is an abbreviated version from the [American Heart Association](http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks/heart-attack-or-sudden-cardiac-arrest-how-are-they-different), but they have the full signs and symptoms of a heart attack or stroke on their website. As well as info on Hands-Only CPR. Hopefully okay to share here.

""People often use these terms interchangeably, but they are not synonyms. A heart attack is when blood flow to the heart is blocked, and sudden cardiac arrest is when the heart malfunctions and suddenly stops beating unexpectedly. A heart attack is a “circulation” problem and sudden cardiac arrest is an “electrical” problem.
 
Symptoms of a heart attack may be immediate and intense. More often, though, symptoms start slowly and persist for hours, days or weeks before a heart attack. Unlike with sudden cardiac arrest, the heart usually does not stop beating during a heart attack. The heart attack symptoms in women can be different than men.

Sudden cardiac arrest occurs suddenly and often without warning. It is triggered by an electrical malfunction in the heart that causes an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). With its pumping action disrupted, the heart cannot pump blood to the brain, lungs and other organs. Seconds later, a person loses consciousness and has no pulse. Death occurs within minutes if the victim does not receive treatment.""


"
514,"This question is SO IMPORTANT!!!! I haven’t, but in my life support class we learned it is a fact that heart attacks feel different for women than men. It’s not as widely known as it should be, but women need to know that a heart attack won’t feel/look like the classic signs. "
515,"I have not had a heart attack but I am a nurse who works in a hospital unit that deals with them on a regular basis :)

Just for clarification, as another Redditor pointed out, a ""heart attack"" is a term commonly applied to two different scenarios: a blockage in a coronary artery that causes heart muscle damage (myocardial infarction) OR when the heart isn't pumping blood properly and essentially stops (cardiac arrest), causing a person to essentially die unless someone helps (I.e. CPR +/- defibrillation). However, the two aren't necessarily exclusive - a myocardial infarction *can* cause a cardiac arrest if left untreated (though cardiac arrests aren't always caused by myocardial infarctions, and there are different types of cardiac arrests.....yeah, it's complicated lol).

So for this post, I'm going to assume ""heart attack"" to mean myocardial infarction, which is more common but harder to diagnose (because let's be real, if you go into cardiac arrest, you die, and that's not hard to miss).

The classic symptoms of a myocardial infarction are:

* Chest pain or pressure (often described as squeezing, like a band over the chest, or ""like an elephant sitting on the chest"")
* Pain radiating to the left arm and/or jaw
* Shortness of breath
* Nausea +/- vomiting
* Sweating
* Just generally feeling that something is very wrong

However, I've also seen lots of people say they had vague symptoms.

Most common of the subtle symptoms is the feeling of indigestion or heartburn. I can't count the amount of times I've heard the story of ""ate a big meal, went to bed, woke up with indigestion, took an antacid, and still felt like shit, continued to take antacids, and when I felt really unwell, went to the hospital."" The general rule of thumb I like to stick to is, if you're having heartburn and it won't go away with heartburn treatment, see a doctor. Even if it's ""just"" heartburn, you'll want to get it treated, anyway, because if left uncontrolled, it can damage your esophagus.

Other vague symptoms would be things like back pain, arm pain, nausea, intense fatigue, and dizziness. In fact, a couple of times, I've had patients who had no symptoms at all until we ran some tests on them; this is most common in people with diabetes.

While women are more likely to have the non-traditional signs and symptoms, men can have them, too, just like women can also have the classic signs. In fact, my first patient with a silent heart attack (no signs or symptoms) was a man!

So yeah, it's not very cut and dry but if you are ever concerned, please just call 911 (or whatever number you call for an ambulance) and get yourself to a hospital. Even if it turns out to be nothing, don't feel embarrassed or feel like you've wasted our time. We always take potential cardiac symptoms seriously because it's hard for us to tell, too, based on signs and symptoms alone, and the tests are fairly easy and quick. And  like a lot of other major ailments, it's best to get treated early rather than let it go on and on, potentially causing major damage.

Lastly, because I always get messaged, *please* no one ask me medical questions about you or a specific person. I cannot make assessments and give advice over the internet. If you have concerns about yourself or a loved one, please see a doctor in person."
516,"My mom had one last year and said it wasn't what men are known to experience at all. She had gone to bed and felt uneasy, said her heart started to ""smash and bang"" and generally felt anxious and unwell. She said she just knew something was wrong and suspected a heart attack, as they run in the family (she was the fourth of her siblings to have one within a three-year span) and my grandmother had died of one when I was a baby. My dad drove her to the hospital and it was confirmed she had a ""mild, non-stemi"" heart attack. Heart disease seems to be hitting the family younger and younger so my brother and I are probably at risk of developing it too.

For the record, my mom has never smoked, quit drinking and had good cholesterol. "
517,"“HNGGHHHH” - me, during my heart attack"
518,"Which part exactly is false? My point was that [women are more likely to experience non-traditional/not-so-obvious signs and symptoms](http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/warning-signs-of-a-heart-attack/heart-attack-symptoms-in-women), but men can, too. The signs and symptoms are really variable across the board.

Quoted directly from the linked page from the American Heart Association:

>“Although men and women can experience chest pressure that feels like an elephant sitting across the chest, women can experience a heart attack without chest pressure, ” said Nieca Goldberg, M.D., medical director for the Joan H. Tisch Center for Women's Health at NYU’s Langone Medical Center and an American Heart Association volunteer. “Instead they may experience shortness of breath, pressure or pain in the lower chest or upper abdomen, dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting, upper back pressure or extreme fatigue.”

Or from the [Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.ca/heart/conditions/heart-attack):

>Women generally recognize the “Hollywood heart attack” with chest-clutching, crushing pain. If their pain is less severe, or if they have non-pain signs such as nausea, sudden fatigue or shortness of breath (signs more often reported by women), they are more likely to delay getting to emergency care, and once there, they are less likely to get fast, aggressive treatment."
519,"1. That my sore period boobs is actually a heart attack. (I get sharp, localized pains sometimes -- and when it's the part of my breast closest to the center of my chest, it can feel like chest pain before I realize -- wait, boob.)

2. That one day, I'll get a sinus infection so bad, the pressure and congestion will cause my eyes to pop out of their sockets. "
520,I have lupus so I'm always sick - I worry that I'm missing something significant like cancer or signs of a heart attack because I think they're just lupus symptoms.
521,"I'm always afraid that any minor chest pain is a heart attack, since I've read about people who can't even tell that's what is happening to them.

Also, I have a butterfly rash on my face, but don't have lupus, so I'm always afraid one day they'll find out that I actually do."
522,"I get chest pain pretty often and am always terrified I will drop dead of a heart attack. I've been screened for heart problems a few times--once because my family carries a congenital condition (I don't have it), once when I was sick and they wanted to cover all the bases, once when I went to the ER for said chest pain. Nothing is wrong with my heart. They keep saying it's just anxiety but now I've started worrying I have some major lung problem or something undetectable. Which, of course, is anxiety, which doesn't help the problem..."
523,I get sharp chest pains sometimes and I have a weird heart defect (regular heart palpitations). This coupled with my mom having had heart surgery half a year ago really convinces me that any sharp chest pain I have is my heart just exploding. 
524,"I'm afraid of falling on my face and shattering a cheekbone. Seriously. Also whenever I feel any pain in my mouth whatsoever, I'm convinced that I'll wake up the next morning missing a tooth, even though I'm nuts about regular dental checkups. I'm also afraid whenever I hear ringing in my ear, because my aunt had a stroke and that was pretty much her only symptom."
525,"I work with stroke patients who have language problems, whether it's being totally aware but unable to get their words out, understanding nothing and saying a bunch of nonsense, or anything in between. It's frustrating for all. So I'm in almost constant fear of having a stroke, especially since I'm on birth control and once when I went three months without taking a placebo week my blood pressure went up. 
I also worry about endometriosis. My sister has it. It's not deadly but I want to have kids one day. :("
526,I have the same thing! When I get anxious my heart starts beating like crazy and sometimes I get chest pains and my mind immediately goes to heart attack :/
527,"I've just had this black cloud over my head all day, I have no idea what it is. Work is nothing but drama lately, today was just another instalment...

The main thing is my health though. I've never had this many problems before. I don't know if unexplained aches and pains is just a fact of life, but I just turned 22. Two years ago I was fine but now I just feel like everything's going wrong?  I've had depression since I was 14, but I've not had a bout of it for a few months. Since around that age I would get colds at least once a month, but again that's calmed down. I fell on my tailbone when I was younger, the pain eased off but it's sort of returning.

Other issues: chest pains. I had a chest infection 2 years ago and ended up with stabbing pains, which the doctor told me was just muscle inflammation and it would go away in a month or so. I STILL HAVE THEM. After about 3 months I went back to the doctor, who then diagnosed it as panic attacks to go with my depression & anxiety. Right. So I made myself feel like I was having a heart attack three times a day? I had no previous history of it so I disagreed. Then I was told that no, it was potentially a blood clot and I had to have a load of testing done for that, but nope. Now i've been told it's probably (note, probably) costochondritis. Doctor says it will go away. Research says if I've had it for this long it's probably chronic, which upsets the hell out of me. No one seems to understand how debilitating it is, I get told I'm making it up, I'm exaggerating, I'm being silly, all sorts.

My back pain is really killing me lately. It's hard to work 8 hours a day at a desk, on top of that I 2 hour round trip commute in which I have to sit in a car, so that's 10 hours a day sat down. And because of the chest pain, guess what, I can't do many forms of exercise! Yay for me! I can swim, 9 times out of 10 I don't get any chest pain. I just get headaches from the chlorine. Aerobics, running or any kind of jumping around makes me feel like I'm having a heart attack. I can't even cycle, which is my favourite thing to do but it's just not worth the pain. Yet I will also get chest pains when I'm just sat down doing nothing. ARGH.

My periods are also really fucked up lately. The pain...

Oh. and a recurring stomach ulcer. Lets just throw that into the mix.  And a newly gained wheat intolerance.

Plenty more to rant about but I will stop... I'm fine for a while and then everything happens at once and all I can do is collapse into bed and cry.

I guess you could say I feel like my body's failing me and I'm only 22.

Working out is not supposed to be painful or give you chest pain. You either should go see the doctor, are overexerting yourself, are not using a machine/exercising/doing the proper form, etc. Or a combination of those. 

If you are feeling pain *at any moment* during your workout, I would strongly advise you to stop working out. "
535,My friend suffers from PCOS and she says the pain is unbearable at times. The pain when a cyst ruptures has her kneeling over and sometimes she actually passes out from the pain. 
536,"My ruptured cysts have both been at random- having sex and riding a bike. Like someone else said, contractions are probably a good comparison. It’s waves of severe pain on top of a consistent lower level of pain.

I think I told the doctor this last time that it felt like my reproductive organs had a migraine, and then someone was intermittently hitting me with a hammer on top of that.

Zofran + ibuprofen + tyelenol + oxycodone makes it bearable, if you want to sit in a hospital bed for 3 hours while they check you out at the ER. 

It also sucks when they jam the transvaginal ultrasound wand up your vagina to better see if it was in fact a cyst/how much fluid has built up from the rupture/etc. That was like... the type of cramping/pain having an IUD inserted felt."
537,"It was the most painful experience of my life. I couldn't move, think, focus, or talk. All I could do was lay down in the fetal position and try not to pass out. The pain was very sharp, it made me wonder if it was comparable to being stabbed with a knife in the abdomen and have it twisted repeatedly. 

I'm very thankful it happened at home. I missed a few days of work and basically just tried not to move."
538,"Obviously I know this. I am consistently measured at a 33 so I go between a 32/34. But I also don't wear bras anymore, so it's not an issue. "
539,"You poor thing.  Once I've forced myself to eat something so I can take painkillers I sit up in bed and watch comedies online until the painkillers kick into gear or I pass out.  Hope you feel better soon!  It is miserable, really hope you can get some sleep soon."
540,"It is a combination of a few things. One is I have PCOS (polysystic ovary syndrome), and another is stress. My brother passed away in a terrible motorcycle accident 8 months ago, exactly when my periods went haywire. Most people skip periods when they have stress, but noooo...not me. Mine doubles! I am not on BC because I smoke and want to quit before I start taking BC because I don't want to get blood clots. On my next appointment, my doctor is going to make me get a pelvic ultrasound which I am not looking forward to :( I need to contact my local union rep, this is ridiculous."
541,"Aha. I only have a rib tattoo, so I don't have anything to compare it to. (Esepcially not a brazilian, haha)"
542,"Sounds like there are two things going on:
1) You need to pull your finger out and get motivated enough to get your life in order.
2) You need to make an effort to start varied and interesting conversations with your girlfriend, so that you two aren't stuck in a rut.

She probably meant she could have helped you by helping you fill out job applications and the like. I also think poesie's got something when it comes to depression.

What do you feel passionate about? To find more motivation, perhaps try doing more of whatever that is, especially if it can be channelled into employment or volunteering."
543,"My insurance at the time wouldnt cover anything having to do with weight management (apparently being almost 500lbs wasnt ""sick enough"" for them) so I paid out of pocket. My surgeon said since I didnt have diabetes or other health conditions that I could go with sleeve, and then if I didnt loose enough I could go back and get a revision to bypass. But since I was self pay, I couldnt count on having a second. So he recommended bypass because people tend to lose more and keep it off longer with bypass."
544,"I'm hoping for the bypass myself, since I'm diabetic! And also, f*ck insurance."
545,"Either his looks weren’t my cup of tea or really he’d sent cheesy/creepy message.

I know this sounds extremely superficial. But back then I had like 16k+ likes and I didn’t want to „waste“ time talking to someone I wasn’t attracted to when there was always another one who I thought was cute.

And, well, the super gorgeous model boys were a pass too because I just knew they weren’t in my „league“ and that I’d always have self esteem issues being with them."
546,"Back when I was using apps, I would bypass if I wasn't attracted to him, he seemed to have a personality from the photos that I wasn't attracted to or they message me with a generic ""hey"" and don't make conversation a 2 way street (they don't ask you questions, convo fizzles out, don't give you much to go on).

Some specifics I found I bypass are:

""So here is a picture of me and a kid but it's not my kid!!!!""
A guy holding a fish... are you trying to compensate for something?
A guy holding a gun. No thanks. 
Any political statements in the profile
A lack of profile - just pics. Did you even try?
A guy doing a lot of sports/outdoorsy stuff. For example, a guy has a picture of him rock climbing, another of him surfing, another hiking. It's just not my thing. 
A guy with a cape. Never trust a man in a cape.
"
547,"Abortion is illegal where I live.

My mom got me the pills, but the abortion went wrong. It also failed. I almost bled to death and fell unconscious. I woke up in the hospital.

Technically I had parental consent, no judicial bypass to go through because it's illegal anyway."
548,"I was carrying a 4'x8' 3/4 plywood with 2""x4"" framed platform on to a truck. The truck was not backed up squarely to the loading dock and so there was a slight gap between the two. After carrying several of those guys on, on the last one, the VERY LAST ONE, I stepped off the loading dock wrong and ended up between the dock and the truck. Dangling with one leg sort of on the truck, one in the gap and my hand squarely between this hundred pound platform and the dock. 

The person at the other end picked it up so I could get out  from under it. I took a look at my fingers, which were very bloody and felt myself go pale (er as I am a redhead), I climbed up the dock, hand wrapped in the lower half of my shirt, I walked calmly but quickly (it was noted by rest of the staff) to the office where I sat in the bathroom and washed it. I nearly passed out while cleaning it.

My boss took me to get it looked at, we suspected broken bones, but thankfully I just skinned (planed if you will) my middle finger on my right hand. I think it was 9 stitches total and I have a sweet 'c' shaped scar! The other fingers had some incidental lascerations but nothing nearly as rough"
549,"I always find that it hurts less when I wax myself. For me, it's kind of like how tickling myself doesn't work; I know when it's going to happen, so it's not a shock and it elicits a much less powerful response than if someone else did it. I'm perfectly capable of ripping a strip of cooling wax off my mons without so much as a tear. If someone else did it? Call the ambulance now, she might have a heart attack."
550,"If she's a great girl, I really hope you won't pass on her just because of her father! My father and I don't have the best relationship and he is very, very overprotective of me. But I recently introduced my boyfriend to him (this is the first time I've ever introduced a guy to my dad) and it went pretty well.

If he is overprotective and unreasonable, the bad news is that he is probably going to stay that way. However, you can make the situation easier on everyone by introducing yourself to her dad and making a good impression. Overprotective fathers usually prefer to know who they're dealing with (the secrecy of going out with ""some random guy"" is shady to them) and a brief introduction can save a lot of trouble. Be polite and well mannered, don't be afraid to make eye contact, look presentable (I'm not talking suit and tie, but leaving the stained tshirt, basketball shorts, and flip flops at home can make a big difference). If he wants her home at a certain time, respect that. Let him know what you guys are doing (""Thank you for letting me take her out to the movies, we'll be back by 11."") 

I know it seems ridiculous and very high school, but speaking as the daughter of an unreasonably overprotective dad, her dad is just looking out for her and if she really likes you, there's no reason why you can't still have an awesome relationship. Feel free to PM me if you want to ask me anything else, hope I helped a bit because I've been in this situation too and I know it sucks. "
551,"She should have never been left alone the day after spinal surgery :( Sepsis is a real thing, it can kill you, and definitely put her into the state she was in. With treatment, she should go back to normal.

If she goes into a nursing home, they will make her spend down all of her assets to 8K before medicaid will kick in. It also must be medically necessary. Her health insurance may provide nursing care once or twice a day, but also only if medically necessary. You could hire someone who does home health care by the hour, or to stop in once a day and check on her.

How about seeing if she'd be interested in a roommate? Someone to help with the expenses, and keep an eye on her?

As far as me, I moved my Mom to a house a 1/2 mile from me. We each maintain our autonomy, but I can easily check in on her regularly and/or run down if she needs anything.

If either of my parents get to the point they can't care for themselves, they will always be 100% welcome in my home, and I will always care for them. They did an amazing job raising me, and I will always be there for them. That being said, that solution isn't for everyone, and there is no 'right' or 'wrong', just what is right for you, and right for them. Best wishes, and good luck."
552,"Ooof,  that's hard,  OP.   

Talk to the hospital and ask them to point you toward local resources.   Many communities or regions have counselors that will help you look at your options,  know what's available. 

My mom is in her 90s; my dad passed a few years ago at 93.  They lived in the house I grew up in,  on their own,  too a ripe old age, but we've talked to these agencies about what to do eventually. "
553,"I'm lucky (well not really), but both my parents have passed away so I won't ever have to deal with this. My dad died of a plane crash (mechanical issues) at 55. He did have congestive heart failure, diabetes, and a host of other issues at the time, but wasn't generally debilitated. A year later my mom was diagnosed with kidney cancer that had already spread everywhere. It was only a month between her diagnosis and her passing. My sister and my aunts were the ones who took her to all her doctor's appointments and she lived in the spare bedroom at my sister's house during that last month until she was in the hospital and then at home hospice for 2 days (I live a state away). It sucks that they're gone obviously, but one of the silver linings is that I won't have to deal with elder care. 

For OP, getting a social worker to start planning how to take care of things would be ideal. Things like having a home care nurse stop by daily to check on her may be beneficial. Getting someone who knows what programs are available would be super helpful. "
554,"Your mom is 62 -- can she get Medicaid or Medicare Part A? They will pay for nursing care. You'll have to look into your state's requirements for applying. There's generally a 60-month lookback rule when applying for Medicaid, so if your mom needs to go into nursing care NOW, you won't be able to hide assets (i.e., consider transferring them to a kid) without a penalty (this of course may also differ by state; I have no idea). 

I'd talk to your mom about a will, a living will, power of attorney, financial power of attorney, etc., when/if she is able. As far as what you're discussing of someone checking in on her...you mean like a home nurse? I'd run that by the hospital or your mom's GP. Insurance may cover it because it may be cheaper for them to do that than to risk more hospitalization.



As for my own personal situation...my mom is in her late 50s and my dad is retired and in his early 60s. Mom is half-blind from a stroke, has diabetes, mobility problems, etc. Dad is mostly immobile. How they're making it financially is beyond me. They are one sort-of-big disaster away from losing their house.

I have printed out a bunch of applications for senior co-op apartments that are subsidized in the area: it would help them out a lot financially, they'd have fewer home responsibilities, etc. I filled out almost all of it except for signatures They refuse to fill it out.

It's very frustrating. When my dad dies, my mom will get almost nothing -- no where near enough to live on, not even when she turns 62. I dread the day, to be honest with you. Neither of my parents were 'good' parents (narcissism) and I can't allow her toxicity into my house. My family comes first.

If my mom dies, my dad is also screwed. He can do almost nothing for himself. He does have mobility problems, but this began long before that. He doesn't know how to do simple self-care things. My mom has told me several times, ""You'll have to come over and pay the bills, make him dinner..."" Nope. I will help where I can, but he will have to learn and in-home help will have to provide the rest. I have a fledgling family to care for. I can't take on doing everything for another.

When the day comes that one of them wants to move in with me, I'll be screamed at, cussed out, etc., for my refusal. It'll be, ""You never helped us!"" Then I'll be standing there saying, ""Really? I helped you with a bunch of housework, gave you opportunities to improve your financial situation, and you shrugged it all off.""

They are the sorts of people who will be speeding toward a wall. You scream, ""You're going to hit that wall!"" They look at you blankly and say, ""Yeah, but not yet, so we're going to keep speeding."" Then they either just barely miss it or slam head-on. Then they climb from the wreckage and go, ""Oh my God, we hit the wall!"" Ya think?

"
555,"I guess they're fortunate because I'm a trained nurse so they know that if things get bad I would be more than happy to move back in with them and take up full time care. My parents put their life and soul into raising me so I wouldn't even think twice about trying to return the favour. My parents have eachother though and are still madly in love. My dad had a stroke last year and my mother was very good at looking after him. Likewise, my mother has had several lapses of cancer over the year and my dad was there to look after her.

For your situation I understand it's more tough. I'm passing no judgement on you as a person but your mother should never have been left alone after major surgery such as spinal. That's on the hospital staff also because they should know to never discharge someone who had serious treatment to an empty house unless there was someone looking after her.

I don't really know what to say to you. Your options are either move in with her and try take some of the care on yourself (which I know can be very personally demanding and even if you do this you'll still need assistance from trained professionals), hire private carers to come see her several times a day, or look into putting her into a facility where she can be appropriately cared for. All of these options are tough and expensive and I really feel for you. 

Seek input from social services; it's their job to help people in your situation find the most appropriate solution to looking after your mother. I'm not from America so unfortunately I don't know an awful lot about your healthcare system or insurance or anything like that, but there definitely is help available you just need to ask for it and keep asking for it.

Also, bear in mind that if the hospital can cure the sepsis then it's likely a lot of her medical problems such as the hallucinations may go away so this situation may not be as tough in the future as it is now. Talk to her physician about this. 

Best of luck, I honestly wish you all the best. "
556,"A very similar thing happened with my dad last year. He had surgery for colon cancer that went fine but later developed sepsis and ended up in a coma. It was awful. He slowly recovered but apparently being under heavy sedation for a long period of time leads to some pretty serious issues, including a loss of muscle strength. My dad had trouble getting around before but now can't stand unaided and can barely walk. This means he can no longer live in his isolated mountain home filled with stairs. 

For awhile my he was staying with my younger brother, who owns a house, but that wasn't working out and actually almost destroyed their relationship, so I found a two bedroom apt and my dad moved in with me. We split the rent and bills just like roommates and so far it's worked out well. But my dad doesn't require any caretaking really. Obviously I want him to live forever but honestly I hope he dies before his body or mind fails completely. I know that sounds awful but I have no idea what we'll do if he requires long term care. None of us can afford it."
557,"As far as the first incident goes its a bit foggy still. The information is very jumbled because I could never get a straight answer. I had tried calling her when she lived further away. She's always been good about answering the phone or getting back to me within the hour during normal hours. When I didn't hear from her I called her work and she hadn't shown up but they didn't give me any information as to whether she called out or not. I called my uncle who lived closer to her than I did to see if he had heard from her. She had called him saying she couldn't get out of bed. So he took her to the hospital. She was fine the next day. Completely back to normal. She stayed with my uncle on that occasion. 

She has no memory of that incident. 

About a month later, she sent me a text saying her primary thinks she had a stroke. She had driven to her primary care doctor, confused, and been told that they should probably call an ambulance for her and she refused. She drove herself home. I called her and told her to call an ambulance, but she didn't want to deal with the cost. She's the most bull headed human being I know. She drove herself to the hospital and was told in the ER that she had no signs of a stroke. I picked her up from the hospital when I got there and she was completely out of it. The clarity she had on the phone was gone. The next morning I woke up to her unable to figure out how to put her underwear on or where anything was in the house. 

I spent much of the next few weeks in her apartment trying to take care of her and back and forth between my place and the doctors office trying to figure out what had happened. They still cant tell us exactly what happened. They blame it on a mixed combination of medications. 

She doesn't remember the events of about 4-5 days for that incident. 

With it happening more than once, I find it hard to believe that it was just medication, but they keep trying to shove that answer down my throat. 


I will absolutely go to her primary with her to see what we can find out. She is currently in the hospital still, and I've been working with a caseworker to try to get her placed in rehab for physical therapy and to have a little more time with care, but all of the places are declining her because she's able to walk 200 feet. Her insurance won't cover much because she's taken the minimum insurance as she does. 

I will see if they have a senior care specialist though. And see if there are any services for where we live. "
558,"She is slowly getting back to normal. I'm afraid this will happen again, though. Considering the complete memory loss has happened more than once prior to the surgery I don't feel like sepsis was the ONLY culprit here. I do feel like it played a nice big part in the hallucinations, though. 

I honestly don't think she has more than 5K in assets aside from owning her car. 

I know she would hate a roommate. I've talked to her about it before, but shes one of those people who have lived alone so long that they're set in their ways. She hasn't had anyone but me living with her since I was 8mos old. Almost 25 years. I wish she'd let a roommate live with her. It'd make life a heck of a lot easier. :P 

I think I might work on finding her a place that is close to me like you've done with your mother. For the most part shes able to function completely normally. Its just when she has the episodes that shes been having this year that I get up in arms worried about her being by herself. On top of the fact that shes getting older, I feel like I might be jumping the gun and trying to be overly cautious with worry. "
559,"The rehab place is ideal - I'm a CNA in a facility like that. We usually have patients stay 2-3 weeks post surgery to get them back on their feet. As soon as you mentioned her confusion, I immediately jumped to infection, so sepsis was unsurprising. Even something as simple as a UTI can make geriatric patients lose their marbles. It's the most bizarre thing... One day they'll be totally with it and clear as day, the next they are telling you that they are pregnant and need to get to the hospital to give birth to a beautiful baby boy. If you can get her into a rehab facility, I definitely recommend it. There are things such as home health aides who can come however often you like, but that one-on-one attention can sometimes be much more expensive. My grandfather is in his 70s and had trouble taking care of a leg wound - being terrified of doctors and too stubborn to admit he needed help, it progressed to a stage 4 leg ulcer (gaping hole in his leg). We did phased him down care-wise slowly: hospital -> rehab -> home health nurse daily (to help him shower and do dressing changes) -> home health nurse weekly -> no nurse, just check-ins with my mom. Definitely see if she has been assigned a social worker - they can direct you to facilities and help you figure out what the best course of action will be for her. "
560,If the time hasn't already passed you should definitely talk to your mom about upping her insurance when open enrollment comes. 
561,"First off, I want to say that I'm very sorry I don't have a solution and that you have to go through this. I know how draining and challenging it is, so I wish you much strength.

> About a month later, she sent me a text saying her primary thinks she had a stroke.

I am SO not a medical expert, but my MIL had a similar event of confusion and it was probably a minor stroke, or what they more accurately call a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA). She didn't suffer the classic symptoms of a major stroke, but instead she went from being really mentally sharp and able to care for herself, to suddenly and abruptly being unable to finish her sentences, and unable to do tasks completely herself. She would ""pantomime"" doing things like brushing her teeth, but she wasn't actually doing it. 

She had the presence of mind to know she was in trouble and asked a neighbor to take her to the hospital. When we went to her house to collect her things, it was clear she was mentally not quite right that day - things a bit scattered and out of place in a weird way.

Anyway, although she lived less than 5 miles away, she came to live with her son and I when they sent her home from the hospital. We knew one day this would be a likely event, but it was sudden and we were utterly unprepared for how much surveillance she required to be safe and to be cared for. I didn't sleep a wink for the few days she was with us.

She had another TIA, more recognizable as a stroke, the third night she was with us during dinner. At first I wasn't sure if it was significant, but I googled her symptoms and called an ambulance immediately. At the hospital they confirmed it was TIA. After a few days of hospital care, they started discussing rehabilitation programs for her. I aggressively advocated for finding a skilled facility that she could live in rather than coming to live with us.

Sadly, I don't have much advice to offer because for one thing, MIL never made it home from the hospital - she had a major stroke and died before she could be discharged. Additionally, she was 86 years old, so had Medicare and supplemental insurance, and she had financial reserves to draw on if she had had to pay out of pocket for skilled nursing care.

And ultimately, as hard as it was on us, we would have of course taken her in if the skilled care didn't work out. I was just deeply concerned about our ability to care for her properly with the level of safety and comfort she needed/deserved. But we would have given it every effort.

Years earlier MIL dealt with her sister no longer being able to live on her own. Fortunately, the sister had purchased specific insurance to cover skilled care in a home for a few years, so when the sister's Alzheimers became too much to handle amongst us, she was well cared for in a home for the rest of her life. She actually did quite well there.

MIL had two cats, we have two cats. All four cats are currently under our roof, albeit, not sharing space quite yet. One of my MIL's cats is an alpha female, and well, isn't respecting the fact that I'm doing *her* a favor by bringing her in. She makes a beeline to start trouble when I let her out in the same space as my cats. I'm working on slowly getting everyone used to each other by stages."
562,"My parents seem to relish in pointing out someone’s size. It’s taken me a long time to stop myself even thinking something horrible about people. So I’ll never let my son hear me fall back into that. 
Also passive aggressive attitudes about things my son does will NOT happen. My dad was the most PA person I’ve ever met and it made me feel awful."

564,"Just curious, at 22 how are your parents still strict with you? You're all grown up! Is there a reason why you can't move out and have some independence? If not, consider going to Upwork or Fivver and seeing what  kind of work you can do online (freelance writing, data entry, etc.) to help pass the time. Also, baking is fun. Or learning a new language."
565,"I’ve only ever had sex with my boyfriend (and he’s only ever had sex with me), but we’ve been together six years and it’s always been awesome. We love each other and both want to make each other feel good, and we also firmly believe the other shouldn’t make themselves uncomfortable just to please us, so sex is very enthusiastic and loving. 

We started out vanilla and were that way for a long time, but a few years ago he confessed to me that he likes when women are dominant. We’ve roleplayed a lot of (very gentle, loving) femdom scenarios and it’s been really fun. I’m not submissive at all, but I’ve realized I do have a dominant side, which was a big surprise because I’m very mild-mannered and unassertive in my daily life. What we do is a lot less kinky than most people would probably think- my limits are I don’t want to be violent at all towards him or call him any names. I was abused by my mom and groomed by a creepy older man when I was underage, so I tread very carefully with this because of my own trauma, even though I’m in the dominant role during our roleplays. My boyfriend has really, really enjoyed this and I do too!

I also have severe vaginismus and have never been able to have penetrative sex. With years of lidocaine injections in my vagina, I was finally able to insert a tampon a year ago. It will be a while before I can ever have penetrative sex, but we have great non-penetrative sex and my boyfriend is so understanding. For both of us, sex is much more a mental and emotional thing than a physical one. We’re both fortunate- we both always orgasm at least once every time. We’re both pretty reserved sexually outside of when we actually have sex with each other, so it’s actually very surprising how connected and in-tune we are with each other during sex! It’s like we can read each others’ minds, it’s amazing. That emotional connection is so important to me and it really makes me crave him. He’s a gentleman and always makes me cum first, too :) He just makes me feel so loved and safe- he’s both really passionate and really gentle and tender. 

My body has also changed over the years, but luckily, my boyfriend loves that I’m now curvier. I was a size 4 and now I’m a size 12, 5’8”. I was very thin when we got together, and I had no boobs or butt. Now I do, and he loves them. I have a hard time accepting my body but it really flatters me that he seems to like it so much. He told me he actually prefers me curvier than when I was thin, which is sometimes hard to believe because my mom constantly called me fat growing up (even though I was tall and skinny)."
566,"My mother always said Sometimes we may not like the things that you do, but we always love YOU. That's an important lesson I will pass on. Unconditional love."
567,">A failure is only a failure if you failed to learn from it.

568,"Once. Was on a sledge on my way down a black piste slope and about halfway I regretted the action. Then came a small jump I didn't see in the dark and I went flying. Somewhere around there I saw these little movie reel of past moments pass through my head and I legit thought I was dying. 

I did not die. But I remember a serene feeling of absolute terror.

Obviously."
569,"He yelled and threw (my) things at me. I was so young and foolish. I thought it meant he was passionate and that he loved me more than anyone else...because nobody else in my life loved me enough to get so angry they would throw things.  

Yeah, no. That's not how it works. When people really love you they don't try to hurt you emotionally or physically. Duh."
570,"My now-ex was a MAJOR hot-head driver. Like the kind that would follow a driver who had cut him off to a parking lot to yell at them, and drive very aggressively to ""teach people how to drive"". There were many embarrassing moments spent in the passenger seat trying to disappear while he yelled out the window at someone who had barely offended him with their driving, not knowing if I should confront him about it, and telling myself he'd never act as entitled toward me.  


But he did, and it didn't take long. It started with a ""fuck you"" when I asked him to bring a bowl of veggies from the kitchen to the dining table instead of just sitting there allowing me to serve him AFTER making dinner without his help every day AFTER working 40 hours same as him. And it progressed into literally not ONE word I said being worthy of his time. I couldn't speak without being interrupted, told I was wrong, or googled (to prove I was wrong) right in front of me, and eventually I just stopped speaking at all. All important decisions were made without my input until I no longer felt like a person and left."
571,"He required constant admiration, adoration, and strokes, which was exhausting. I had no idea someone could be that needy.  Disagreeing with him about something hurt his feelings. For instance, I wanted a Wendy's hamburger instead of the chicken sandwich, which he wanted me to have. He saw that as a personal affront.  I couldn't ask him to do the simplest thing, without him pouting or having a tantrum. I saw these things early on, but because I'd never encountered these traits in anyone, I ignored them. They were no big deal as he had many good qualities. Regardless, we're divorced now. No more man-children for me."
572,"Can I answer as a woman going through her second divorce? 

1st marriage: 
1. That his family made me super uncomfortable with being myself around them. Very controlling and manipulative family. (No matter how many times you tell yourself that your husband is “different” than his parents and siblings, the hard truth is, no, not really - they’re going to perpetuate the very thing they grew up observing from their parents. 
2. Super emotional, insecure, and needy, and immature. And COMPLETELY at the mercy of his family.
3. Snapped at me during stressful moments and completely unable to handle any day to day stress.
4. Repeatedly making me feel insecure by commenting on other attractive girls around us. 

2nd Marriage:
1. Again - A product of his family. If you don’t like his mom OR dad, he may be just exactly like them, especially as the years pass. Probably most definitely IS like them. 
2. Times when I could see that he repeatedly put his own needs ahead of my own. Even as I was accommodating and willing to put his needs first. 
3. Pressured me to marry him before I felt ready (I went a head because I was afraid of losing him if I didn’t) 
4. Super sensitive and manipulative at times. 

Reading thru these I feel like a COMPLETE IDIOT that I ignored these things and actually married these guys. But I tend to see all of the potential in a person instead of who they actually are. And I have often sold myself short, thinking I didn’t deserve better. Don’t do that to yourself. You always deserve the very very best."
573,"His spending behavior. Started dating and realized every penny he ever had just burned a hole right through his pocket. I was pretty decent with my money so I figured it would be okay. Long story short 
4 months after we got married while I was at work he found my hidden key to my fireproof lockbox that had all of my legal paperwork and passwords to important accounts (passport, social security card, birth certificate, and my banking information) logged onto my bank account and transferred $15,000 (all of the money I had in the world) to our joint savings account that we had for bill purposes, drained our joint account which had $3,000 that I alone had put in there and ran off with one of our coworkers all within a 9 hour shift before I had any idea what had happened. Because he took all of my savings I no longer had the money to pay any of my bills and got very deep into debt and became homeless because I had no family close to help me or for me to stay with. I was lucky enough to have a car that was paid off and I was able to pay my car insurance and gas so I was able to live in it. It was a little 2003 VW Beetle. I was able to afford a gym membership at Colaw for $5 a month and they had showers I was able to use and I would just go at 2 or 3 A.M. when no one was there to shower and wash my clothes in the shower. It was the hardest year and a half of my life trying to pick the pieces back up. I think it’s where I hit rock bottom, or at least I hope it was rock bottom because if it gets any worse than that I don’t think I’d make it a second time around. 

I was very young (19 I’m now 22) and he and I had many many many more issues that were too sensitive for me to post here that were red flags that I was too ignorant and innocent to see. Though I think this is one of the most important things. Keep your finances separate from your spouse. And DON’T marry anyone who can’t save any money because you’re just going to be in for a really rough life."
574,"Lack of sexual chemistry/passion. I know passion fades over time but if it was never there in the first place, that is a red flag. They can look 100% on paper but do not settle for just “nice” or “dependable”.  Life is too short to not have that spark."
575,"My ex was a farmer and that all he thought and talked about. Every conversation we had was about cows or feed or tractors. He had no interest in me or my hobbies. He was also a workaholic and an alcoholic, he would wake up at 3:30am and go to work til 4pm and then head straight to the farm and work there til 9pm or later. Then when he got home he’d drink a fifth of whiskey and pass out, I could never understand how he could maintain that schedule. He was a mostly a nice guy and tried hard to be what he thought the American dream was, but emotionally he was unavailable in a big way. I tried to leave him and shit got crazy, he basically stalked me for 6 months begging me to take him back, going so far as to propose to me while we were broken up...I declined but tried to give him a second chance but he didn’t change. I left him for good and he cried and screamed and swore he’d never love again and was married to some other poor girl 6mo later."
576,"Drinking habits. I come from a family who only really drink at social occasions or on a night out. He comes from a family who drink to excess all the time at home. 

I have had probably 2 drinks in the last couple of years, the last being on my birthday, he drinks most nights. Not just a little but like generally 12 cans of Guinness original. It’s generally a case of if we have the money he is drinking. Seriously approx £15 a night. 

We don’t go out, so it’s always drinking at home, every birthday/Xmas etc gifts from family members are always alcohol, in which case he will drink more than the normal 12 cans. 

£15 a night may not sound like much but it’s generally at least 5 nights a week and more money than we get to spend on food for the whole family (5). We are permanently skint, never have the money to do anything. The house is always in disarray because I am disabled and he generally doesn’t have the energy/will/whatever to decorate, garden, keep things tidy. 

We are always starting the day off behind as when he drinks the cans just get thrown all over the floor, so it’s tidy up the floor before anything else. 

His drinking has really put me off drinking. I do not want our kids to have his drinking habits (or my eating habits but at least I am trying to change my ways!) but he just won’t stop. 

The amount of times I have heard “that’s it I’m not drinking ever again...I mean it this time” yeah I know he don’t mean it. 

The last was him saying at the end of May, I am not going to drink for the whole of June, if I do I will go to AA. Guess what? He managed not to drink for the first two days, which was because we didn’t have the money for him to drink, then he borrowed money off his mother and has drank every night since. 

I have repeatedly told him that his drinking will cause the end of us, that I can see how the years go by I am getting more and more resentful of it and him and I don’t want to end up bitter and it to ruin us but he just will not change. I have threatened to throw him out if he drinks again, he still drinks. He has tried once in the past to get help from GP but said that the GP was amazed he was only drinking beer and not spirits and seemed to generally not be so concerned once he heard that. 

He won’t go back. 

We are both 40/41, kids are 9,11,12. I have warned him on more than one occasion that if they have his family’s attitude towards drinking when they grow up I will kill him. He just kinda makes approving noises and that’s it. 

There has been numerous occasions where me and the kids can hear him throwing up after too much alcohol, the kids are just used to daddy being drunk (he is not a day drinker as such but will start general once the kids are home from school), recently there have been numerous occasions where I have gone to bed early (7pm ish) as it’s just not enjoyable sitting downstairs with someone getting blasted every single night, and the 12yo will go down for a drink or to use the toilet and daddy is passed out in the chair (always adamant he doesn’t pass out, he “falls asleep”, and then my 12yo locks the house up for him. 

(Kids spends most of their time in their bedrooms but we only have a downstairs bathroom and toilet)

——-
And as I type this I can literally see myself reading someone else’s post and internally screaming “THROW HIM OUT UNTIL (If) HE GETS HELP” but easier said than done irl. 

Tempted to show him this post but I know it will just end up with the same promises and him being depressed for a couple of days until he gives in and drinks again. With that said we again have absolutely no money until we get paid on Monday so I know he will be sober over the weekend, but bet you that come Monday he will be round the corner shop again getting beer.

ETA: neither of us work, I used to be the breadwinner until mental breakdown in 2014/2015, he was the househusband. We have been married 13 years in August. I love him, but I can see it slowly being eroded over the years and turning into resentment. I always lived by myself and supported myself, and am used to doing as such, I have given so much towards this and bent/broke so many of my own internal walls to be with and stay with him."
577,"Wow that one hit home. I remember watching the « love the way you lie » Eminem and Rihanna’s music video where Megan Fox and Dominic Monaghan fight and yell at each other before having passionate sex. And I thought « oh wow this looks like me and my bf, that’s true love right here ». I was 20. Now I’m 26 and last time I watched it, I cringed the whole time and felt sorry for the characters."
578,"Thankfully I didn’t marry the man, but realizing this was part of the reason I got out. He would spend hours ranting about how everyone else was setting him up at work, how he couldn’t catch a break because he was the only honest person in a den of thieves, and he loved to be able to secretly go behind his boss’s back & do things while making sure they didn’t catch him so he could be the smart one who got things accomplished. He lived to one up people while telling stories & blow his accomplishments out of proportion. 

It was bizarre when I finally figured out that he couldn’t be happy unless he was throwing the blame for bad things in his life off onto someone else. I got tired of getting all the faults from his previous failed relationships projected onto me (accusations of infidelity, talking to men with the intent to cheat when we had a conversation in passing, etc). 

It took me a while to piece it all together & realize he was a narcissist, but yeah, glad I escaped when I did."
579,"How many things did you not learn as a kid that you realized you needed to know as an adult? Did you do something about it?

Not being taught as a kid excuses you up until not knowing that thing becomes apparent as an adult. Then you're responsible for teaching yourself. We all manage to do it at work and in school, home and our own relationships are no different. Need to stop giving men passes on this sort of thing."
580,"My ex did the same thing. I had this china set passed down from my great grandparents and while we were living together he would just quietly walk off and grab the plates and teacups, quietly exit to the backyard and smash them on a rock and was calm about it the entire time. He’d come back and act like the argument never happened and would pretend like everything was normal afterwards. Smashed at least 2 plates every night. I no longer have a single piece of the China set. He also broke my moms full wine set that she gave me. After he broke all of my stuff he quit breaking things."
581,"I was considering making my own post, but would love to ask your advice if you have a few minutes to spare.  


My friend is in an emotionally manipulative relationship, has been on and off the past two years. She literally was talking about it the night we met two years ago, and here we are and they are still in the same cycle. 

Right now I am OK to help and support but I've had compassion fatigue with it in the past. They break up, she wants to talk about it all the time and it's all she can think about, it eats her up. They get back together, I don't hear from her for weeks because she's soaking up as much of it as she can before it inevitably ends again. They're like a rubber band - one of them pulls away and the other springs back closer and holds on, and vice versa. 

So can I ask, how did you eventually end this cycle? Asking on behalf of my friend, it just seems like it's never going to end. She's been through a lot in life and one time she said to me ""I know this isn't good but I just don't have the fucking energy to fight for something more"" which is heartbreaking but I feel insightful of where her mind is at?

Can I also ask, how can I be a supportive non-judgey friend but help her get to where she needs to be? I know it's her life and she's gotta live it...but I want to do what I can to help. 

Any advice would be hugely helpful please - I am a bit of a loss right now! Sorry for word vomit. Thanks"
582,"I just got engaged and have been prowling this list just to make sure I’m not missing anything my own partner might be doing and honestly, he has none of these issues. I’m not saying he’s a perfect human being, but our relationship is so strong and so loving. Don’t give up on the idea of true love or of men that actually have their shit together and know how to be good partners. 

I would normally never list all the wonderful things I love about my partner because I don’t like to rub it in anyone’s face, but as proof that amazing men and successful relationships do exist, here’s a snapshot of mine. :)

He’s educated, ambitious but not overly competitive, compassionate, nurturing, funny, intelligent, curious, playful, principled, affectionate... I could go on and on. 

We agree politically and he has even put a ton of time and effort into learning more about the issues I care about (I’m pretty passionate about social justice). 

We split our housework evenly and never keep tabs on what each other has done. 

He never acts jealous or mistrustful. I never feel suspicious or jealous of him because he just makes it so clear to everyone around us that he loves me. 

He loves kids and is an amazing uncle. 

He is soooo supportive. He believes in me and encourages me to follow my dreams. He learns about my ADHD and not only empathizes with my struggles but helps me overcome them in concrete ways. This year he is supporting me financially so I can take time to heal from an incredibly stressful 5 years of grad school that left me emotionally and physically depleted. 

He is close with his family and with my mine. He is a loyal friend and his friends are all amazing people. 

He spends his free time working on hobbies and learning skills. He loves reading, gardening, cooking, and just generally being productive. 

And finally, he is a super generous and passionate lover! He’s a feminist and is working to unlearn harmful male-centric narratives about sex. 

And guess what! He’s not the only one! 

Sorry for the brag. I hope it reaffirms your belief! Mating for life isn’t for everyone but it can definitely be beautiful and happy!"
583,"Awwww thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm not in a terrible marriage, I truly love my husband...we're just different people. I'm passionate as fuck, and he's  meh. I like bright shiny things and he prefers duller objects. We've been together for so long, we are like roommates, it's not the worst - and to be honest leaving would be so upsetting,  so I stay....and do a lot of extra curricular activities that make me happy!"
584,"I feel like it's really easy for anyone on the outside of relationships & who has 5 sentences of background to pass judgment but it wasn't until I was 6 years into this relationship & 2 years into the marriage before I realized it was an issue.  The relationship before my husband was so awful & toxic & scary that being with him finally made my life feel safe & normal.  He has never name called, physically hurt me, played mind games, manipulated me in any way and that was a big change for me so it felt like an incredible relationship.  He is funny, he has a great family, he is a good provider, he would be a wonderful father.  We were part of the same friend group so the first 4 years of our relationship involved being around them.... but then I reconnected with 2 super close girlfriends when their life circumstances changed & made it possible for us to all hang out again. But it was never something he wanted to be a part of if it meant leaving home.  They were more than welcome to visit but if it was going out of town he didn't want to go and that's when I noticed that was only the top of the iceberg, if I was hot he was cold, if I liked this food he hated it, if I liked this show he liked that one.... and so on.... two things we agree on, we love each other & hate the color red.  That's pretty much it. He is good to me & he's a good man. But life is hard when EVERYTHING is a compromise."
585,"I don't think they mean physically needy, the ""strokes"" are metaphorical. ""He required constant admiration, adoration, and strokes"" = he needed constant emotional validation. To be told that his ideas were smart, his jokes were funny, his work was perfect, etc etc etc, all the time. No disagreement allowed, no criticism, no suggestion that he's anything less than perfect. Otherwise there's pouting and/or angry tantrums.

Which is incredibly exhausting, and can eventually make *you* feel insecure and inadequate. People like this are emotional black holes; they're unfillable. Even if you try, it's never enough."
586,"I was going to DM you, but decided to keep it here in case anyone else might relate. So I apologise that it's not a direct response to the topic.

I wanted to reply because apparently the kind words of a stranger have the capability of making me cry. Thank you and thank you for teaching me about myself. I honestly cannot express how much your comment means to me. 

Unfortunately, it's incredibly hard to believe and work on. I've seen the damage I've done, and the fact that I was doing it unintentionally kind of makes it worse and reinforces the idea that we shouldn't get love or involve ourselves. 

I can feel compassion for groups: whether it's BLM, helping animals, marching for LGBT+ issues, etc. I genuinely want a better world for everyone, even those who might be not great people, but that individual level relationship building skill is not there, and because I didn't grow up with it, recognizing healthy relationships feels impossible. It's so frustrating to see people with functioning relationships and people who care about them and healthily show emotions only to know you can never have the because you only hurt people because you actually can't understand. 

It feels very much like it's either I can continue to break things or I can just abandon it and go help the world at large by doing science for good causes."
587,"Please, please believe that you are worth finding happiness for. 

You also are a good cause. 

I am learning what a healthy relationship looks like. I’m still finding out. I’m 46. When I was 39 I was still in the marriage I described in my post. It’s not too late for you. This may be the time for you to take some action to help you. 

If you could see you and talk to you then you would give compassion and care to you. Does that make sense? 

My ex-husband taught me my feelings,  my self was not worthy of a fulfilling relationship. He was wrong.

You tell yourself your feelings are beyond you and the you are not worth a fulfilling relationship. Please consider that you are wrong. 

Sending more hugs."
588,"Well, it wasn't me. But there are traits typical of Aspergers, like lack of empathy, extreme reactivity, not liking physical affection or kissing (I saw a statistic that said half of all NT/AS marriages are celibate) that can make relationships between neurotypical people and those on the spectrum difficult. These traits are actually part of the metrics used to diagnose adults with ASD. Sure, everyone can be an asshole at times, but they are exaggerated and more consistent with people on the spectrum. Here's a good explanation  https://www.theneurotypical.com/how-to-spot-aspergers.html"

I also have some of her recipes, and I inherited most of her sewing supplies after she passed. She tried to teach all of us how to sew, but I'm the only one who really kept it up."
592,"In the 1940s, my grandfather worked out of town during the week while my grandmother took care of the small farm and 3 kids. Hobos would come to the door and ask for food. She was a compassionate soul and made up a plate of food for them. While she opened the door to hand them food, she kept one foot next to the door to prevent them from pushing inside while holding a claw hammer at the ready behind her back.

My daughter and I both have claw hammers we keep handy for unexpected situations in her honor."
593,"If we can easily pass through this covid times is because of her teachings and because of her way of life only. social distancing and her hygiene regime is her way of life. Many things from various aspects of life I have learned from her.
1. whatever good or bad she hears, or happens to her she says "" krishnarpanastu"" means all goes ro Lord Krishna. Detachment.

2. never used soap, medicines or chemicals or food from market including biscuits. She always had sort of medicines from her kitchen. 
Haldi, various spices, cow ghee. and her plants like Alovera, drumsticks. All my botanical, knowledge cones from her and my grandfather. She is never on any sort of suppliments. We have started this practice and last  3, 4 years we feel healthier and better likewise I have uncountable kitchen tips dos and don'ts from her."
594,I love all of these comments! My grandmother lived in another country and passed away when I was very young so I didn’t get the chance to have a relationship with her.
595,"One grandma taught me how to bake, crochet and sew which are some of my favourite pass times; the other taught me how to accept a compliment with grace. Women are so quick to brush off a compliment because of their insecurities 

eg. “Hey I like your pants”, “oh these are old and only cost like 3$ and there’s a hole in them” or “I like your hair” “ugh I haven’t washed it in days and I tried to straighten it but it’s humid out”...Just say thank you"

598,"A LOT of youtube--Uuuhhhnn/I Like to Watch with Trixie and Katya, Binging with Babish, Lindsey Ellis, Todd in the Shadows, Ask a Mortician, Contrapoints, Buzzfeed Unsolved and Shane, Ryan and Steven's new channel Watcher, a constant stream of music--so much just listening to music that i honestly should use my record player more, get my eyes off a screen and like paint or journal or something lol.

For reading, especially when i'm at work, I usually hit up some news sites (NPR, Buzzfeed, the Guardian--less recently because of the election), I find Buzzfeed's Finance/Personal Finance articles weirdly soothing, and I recent discovered Bitches Get Riches, a personal finance blog by two women.

Books lately have been varied. I replaced my long-expired library card recently because my book buying habit was sending me to financial ruin, and i've basically been reading whatever holds have come through--A Jest of God by Margaret Laurence (canadian lit about a spinster that was weirdly fascinating and relateable), a romance novel (Get a Life Chloe Brown--super cute, light read), Bad with Money by Gaby Dunn (personal finance that doesn't make everything about avocado toast, by a genuinely interesting woman), and now a book on relationships by a divorce lawyer (If You're in My Office It's Already Too Late). It's probably the most i've actually read in a while lately--less time staring at my book collection trying to decide, more time actually trying to finish a book before the due date. I'll find random free ereader stuff online occasionally too, like a novella by Samantha Shannon released exclusively on epub (the novella was the Dawn Chorus, the latest in a series of hers I got into earlier this year) and now i'm reading sci fi dystopian smut by Kit Rocha because it weirdly makes me feel better about the state of the world.

Not so many podcasts, but my commute is about to get longer so I'm planning on returning to: Bad with Money (the podcast, also by Gaby Dunn), Just Between Us, Lore and Crimes of Passion."
599,"Moms still alive but my dad passed 3 years ago. 

I think he was a semi unhappy person that never really was open nor made much effort in general. 

I’m glad as a person I’m doing everything I can to make sure I’m happy, I explore what the world has to offer and I’m open about what I’m dealing with."
600,"I very recently lost my dad I was very very close to and there are a few things that come to mind:

\-I am so glad that I kept most of the cards and letters he wrote me since my childhood. He always wrote pretty extensive christmas and birthday cards talking about our achievements and his wishes and advice for the future for me. I have started sorting them chronologically and reading his words to me at different points in my life is very comforting even if it is sad and hurts. It's like having him with me and hearing him in a way.

\- Linked to that: Try to keep a recording of their voice. The thought that I will never hear his voice again and maybe forget how it sounded suddenly came to me after he passed and I spent a long time frantically searching for a recording or video where he is speaking.

\- Also linked to that: Take lots of photos. Some people don't like to be photographed but having those pictures will be very important to remember a person.

&#x200B;

And one practical note:

You do not want to think about it but death is a bureaucratic nightmare. Funerals are hellishly expensive. If you are the person who will have to take care of that, you will not have time to grieve at first. You will be calling funeral homes and offices and be taking care of arrangements *full-time*. Prepare for that. Ask your parent what their wishes regarding their funeral are. Ask if there is a will. Ask if there are insurance policies or savings for that. Ask where the imporant papers are. You will drown regardless but it may at least keep you from going bankrupt."
601,"My mom died when I was 9. I’m very very glad that the last thing I said to her before she walked out the door was, I love you. 

She was going through a really hard time with my dad before she passed and I told myself I needed to start acting better and being nicer to her bc she was so stressed. I’m glad the last thing she remembers of me was not of me acting like a little shit.

ETA: I wish I’d gotten to have kids, get married, have her to tell about my first sexual experience, my first everything really. There’s so many things I feel I missed out on but it is what it is and life goes on. It’s been 20 years since she’s been gone so I’m not so jaded about things anymore."

613,"Depends on the context.  

When working on a team project where ideas and approaches make a difference, I am often glad that the idea has two parents and more likely to move forward.  Others have always noted and credited me as needed as well as appreciated my not creating an issue over the idea generation or work authorship.  I’m sure the one appropriating the idea received the “credit” for their behavior.  If not, I’ve more productive things to do than dwell on credit for past work.

One can also see this behavior as a tool.  Rather than have future ideas or work passed over, enlist this person to support your work.  They can also become a supporter for you on future projects, as you are potentially more valuable than others.

Not for everyone or every such situation, but I suggest careful consideration and use in appropriate situations.

One of my sons, when someone turned in his paper as his own work, when confronted by the teacher and the fine fellow denied copying the paper asked the other fellow about a word in the paper whose meaning the fine fellow didn’t know.

For programs, I sometimes imbed my name and date in a cell that isn’t displayed.  Not hard to do and can make proving authorship relatively easy."

While I’m not working, I am mainly binge watching YouTube videos of a guy named Gilbert Arcinienga who has a whole bunch of videos from the late 80’s, 90’s, 2000’s and today. That is what is getting me through quarantine as his videos remind me of better times. I also scroll through reddit, facebook (mainly the facebook groups such as Girls Advice) and instagram (mainly to see photos of my niece as I haven’t met her yet) to pass time as well."
624,"Your network is def important. With or without contacts, its also very much about finding the right fit. One way our field differs from others is that you can be perfectly qualified for a job, but if what's in your portfolio doesnt exactly match the look and feel of what the job will entail, they might pass on you. I had so many ""almosts"" and it was encouraging but frustrating at the same time lol.

Just know that if things arent taking off for you right away, theres nothing wrong with you and you're not destined for failure, you just need to believe and keep at it. The less-supportive side of my family was telling me ""well maybe you should switch careers if its taking this long for you to be successful"" and now I love to rub it in their faces muahahahaha!"
625,"That ""no means no"" applies in every situation, and a man willing to ignore it in one context is willing to ignore it in another context. If I say ""no"" to a man for anything (dating, dancing, an unsolicited ride home,etc.) and he ignores it, that's a red flag that he will ignore my ""no"" to other, more serious things. 

I'll never have a daughter but if I did, I'd pass that along. Agency exists all the time. If he doesn't listen when you don't want to dance with him, he won't listen when you don't want to have sex with him."

All I know about him was that he came to America when he was 8 on a boat from Greece with his family. Nothing else. I want to know if he remembered the trip, if he remembered Greece before he left. If he missed it there,  why he didn't teach Greek to his children. 

I wish I knew more about him, but all I know was that he was a loving and passionate man full of life, ripped away from us at 50 years old due to prostate cancer."
630,"I never asked my god father, why he never told us (my mother and I) his resting place. 

He always said, “If anything happens to me, someone will contact you, and you will be taken care of.” But when he passed, his family absolutely hated my mother and I. From my understanding, they were partially racist and didn’t want us at his funeral service and never told us his resting place. That was nearly 10 years ago. 

To this day I don’t know where his final resting place and I never received any closure to his death. I never got to say goodbye to the one man who took me in, looked after me, and paid for my college education. I never told him how much I loved him and how much he meant the world to me. This will forever be my biggest regret in life."
631,Not a question in general but I've always wanted to ask my grandpa about his WWII stories. He was a lot of large scars on this body and I've always have questions about it. I even planned on writing a book about him. Unfortunately he passed away in his sleep two years ago...
632,"Second this! Some people are jerks! Meaning if adopted kids don't look enough like you, you get stares in the grocery store/playground/everywhere and people ""innocently"" asking questions or saying how noble you are for raising your own kids (regardless of how you got them). If she was told she was infertile on top of this, that could possible bring up feelings of guilt/pain for not being able to have her own children ""naturally"" so having the constant states/comments could be painful. You are hers. Stare all you want, this is MY baby. If you didn't even think to ask the question before she passed its because she loved you so much you never had a reason to - that is your answer."

She wrote poetry+plays, and was basically single handedly responsible for holding off persecution of the protestants in France while she lived despite being a Catholic until her death. Literally, as soon as she died her brother Francis allowed several laws persecuting protestants of all stripes to be passed which resulted in several massacres and 8 religious wars. She was a Queen of Navarre and helped run her husband's entire estate, and was deputized on more than one occasion to act as an ambassador and diplomat both for her husband and her brother, including riding nonstop for over a week to meet a deadline to free her brother from imprisonment during a war. She was also a patron of the arts, including Leonardo da Vinci. She was widely loved by both her own people and her brother's and would move freely and without any sort of protection or escort among common people which was incredibly dangerous for most nobility, but she was known to be so charitable and generous that she never came to any harm. She also saw to it that her daughter Jeanne was educated as well as she had been. Jeanne inherited the Kingdom of Navarre, was also known to be incredibly intelligent and acknowledged as a capable leader at a time that few women were, and Jeanne's son went on to be Henry the Great, aka Good King Henry of France."

* You can't give what you don't have.

* You can't take care of others if you don't take care of yourself.

641,When my Father in law passed away very suddenly a group of nurses had pineapple pins made in his memory. A little back story so that you will understand the meaning of this.

He has been gone for two years and we still miss him everyday but those little pineapple pins are a great reminder of him.

I ate those instead of lunch, then on the plane and shared with mom when I got there.

644,my grandfather’s sister passed away a couple years ago and i was absolutely devastated because she was everything to me and i loved her so much and i was grieving for the longest time. i even had to miss a couple days of school because of how much her death affected me. but everyday afterschool my friends came over with snacks and would bring me the homework and helped me with what i missed in school as well as let me vent and cry. i appreciate them so much for the comfort they’ve given me through it.
645,"My dad passed away in December of 2016. I was 18 at the time and my little sister was 16. My childhood friend brought a gingerbread house for us 3 to decorate the day after he passed while we were waiting for my extended family who was flying in from afar. I didn’t think I was able to laugh in such a difficult and heart shattering time but when we were done, we looked at my sister’s (who is not artistic at all) side of the gingerbread house and it looked terrible. We all had a good laugh about it. I have so many friends and family who were present for me but this was a special something that felt good after the tragedy. Everyone was so focused on how we were feeling that I really appreciated the small distraction. 

I had another childhood friends come the night off his passing and she held me for hours late into the night. I’m truly grateful for her too"

I get others might not want as much space, but I think **letting the griever lead the interactions regarding the loved one is the most valuable thing.**

I still don’t think she realizes how much that meant to me."
650,"Thank you so much for your advice. I will try to take it to heart. I've already acted upon much of it.

A lot of things have been complicated by corona, as well as the fact that we were living in a different country - I had only been there for a year, arriving a few months before corona struck, so I never had any friends or social support there, and our parents weren't able to come visit, again due to corona. But we're back in our home country now (since a week ago), where we grew up and where our parents live, so we're able to receive so much more support now, and it really is making a huge difference.  
This really is the worst time to be dying, when everything is shut down, and you're not able to do any of the things you want to. And at the same time, the risk of corona itself is something that would likely cut her life even shorter, so we really can't take many risks. Even getting married is proving to be a little difficult. But we'll manage, even if it'll end up a bit unorthodox. 

I'm sorry for rambling a bit. And for such a belated reply. Thank you again so much. <3  
I don't know anyone who's been in a comparable situation to this. Would it be okay if I send you a message in the future, if I need advice? I think I might end up being particularly lost, when it finally comes to pass..."

My SO is Latino as well but he is considered a white passing Latino where some people may assume he is American/non Spanish speaker. 

because of where we live and people assuming I’m not biracial we’ve never had any harassment about our relationship. However I do get weary and worry about traveling to “whiter” more rural parts of the US as I wonder if people will treat me and my SO differently or have certain assumptions because I am more “ethnic looking” than he is. 

To play it safe I think my travels along the continental US will be mostly focused on densely populated major cities. :)"
655,"I’m mixed (Asian passing) and there is always so much bullshit, often it’s subtle like racist jokes and offhand remarks but sometimes it’s disgusted stares and being made to walk in the gutters and threats and being followed. But my white partners were always oblivious to it and the worst of it never came out when they were around. 

Honestly I have trouble believing these other commenters who don’t think they have experienced any racially based harassment. If they’ve never experienced it how could they notice it? I remember walking around with a mixed race black friend of mine, and he insisted on crossing a street to avoid a group of young white men I hadn’t even noticed, but they were all staring him down and seemed to be posturing for a fight. If he hadn’t pointed them out I never would have known, and I experience more racism than a white or white passing woman."
656,"I've been with my bf for 11 years and luckily we haven't experienced outright harassment for being together. I'm mixed middle eastern and white (but pretty white passing according to most) and my bf is Chinese. We haven't had issues with racism while traveling, but we have in our home country. However, the racism was more targeted towards him directly, so basically it was strangers being racist and shitty towards him while walking together. 

The first time was when we were 17 or so and this group of white teenage boys started making 'ching chong' and similarly original mocking noises as we passed by. The second time was when we were in our early 20s. My bf and I were walking home together holding hands, and two black girls started yelling at my bf about having a small penis and other disgusting stereotypes when we passed by them. 

The second situation really caught me off guard. Maybe I was really naive, but I didn't expect two individuals who probably had their own experiences with racism to say such garbage about another person. It really made me open my eyes to how pervasive anti-asian racism is and how it can be perpetuated by all races, even in the country I live in."
657,"Because no one was. He accidentally locked eyes with a stranger, they looked back. That's all that happened. They didn't turn around and point, they didn't whisper to the person next to them. They had a staring contest as they walked past each other and then he said someone was staring at us. It was a biracial couple passing us as well. When I say he thinks people stare, it was one time."
658,"A horrible student was in my GCSE retake class. She had narrowly missed out on a passing grade in her exam so she put no effort into her work, thinking she’d ace the retake. She was surly and arrogant and belittled the EFL students in the class every lesson despite getting in trouble for doing so. We did a mock exam and when it was over she boasted about how easy it was in front of the rest of the class, telling them they must be idiots if they didn’t pass. When I marked the exams, she didn’t pass. She got almost the lowest possible grade. It took every ounce of self control I had not to laugh in her face. She was such a nasty person."

663,"My mom taught me to be there for people. One of the things I’ve seen her do is to sit with friends and family as they wait for someone to have a medical test or surgical procedure done. Sitting alone and stressed in a waiting room,  worrying about a loved one is a miserable thing to endure. She brings a deck of cards or a book and will sit with her friend to make the time pass more quickly. If they want to talk or play, then great. If they just want to sit, they sit. They are still going to worry about their loved one, but they don’t have to do it alone."
664,"She’s taught me SO much but the thing I cherish the most is the deep value of compassion and serving others as one of the truest forms of love and being good to others. Compassion encompasses empathy, kindness, patience, and much more for me :)"
665,"My mother is the most forgiving, merciful person I know. She taught me to give the benefit of the doubt to the ones we love. She taught me that a loved one can fuck up and still be worth loving. She demonstrated how much courage it takes to be warm and kind, when other people could use it against you. And how to continue to be kind, even when they do. I don’t know if I can say she passed that down to me, but I know I sure try to be more like her in that aspect. 

This generation is all about self fulfilment, self serving, self protection, self importance. Which are all healthy things, in measure. But I feel the other side - serving others, forgiving others, protecting others - kind of get left behind. Even though they are equally important to self worth and happiness in the long run, I think. 

She also passed down the notion of letting your child be and find who she is. Letting her find her way, and being the soft place to land when, at times, she loses her way. I hope to pass this down to my son and possible future children when the time comes. 

Also, on a less serious note, to turn duvet covers inside out and pull them over the duvet that way. My SO used to just stuff the duvet in and burns the calorie equivalent of 10 cheese burgers spending five years shaking the duvet into place.

671,"Well I’m childfree, but I’ll pass on her best advice to you: when you have a huge bill, even if you can’t pay the minimum payment, send something. $5 can keep you out of collections and preserve your credit rating, as long as you are communicating with your debtor, and showing good faith in trying to pay off your debt. I’m cash broke but credit rich—thanks, mom! 

And she also taught me some street awareness techniques to keep myself safe and that diaper useful and has come in handy more than once. Mostly amounts to beings aware of your surroundings and make eye contact with anyone shady. Let a predator know you’re not an easy mark because you see them and you know they know you see them, which equals positive ID. It’s not 100% guaranteed but it helps a lot."

673,"My mom is a southern lady raised by a southern lady. One thing you have to learn about women from the deep South is that they believe highly in good manners. My mom may have gone a little overboard in trying to raise me to become a ""lady"" but there are aspects of my raising that I have appreciated. Nowadays, I'm an elementary school teacher and I see how some kids are never taught manners and how to be respectful of others. So I think that's what I want to teach my kids. Some examples of some things that my mother thought were SO RUDE and I was not allowed to do in front of her are:
- yawn really loud
- curse
- loudly pass gas
- stuff my mouth/ chew loudly/ slurp
- not say thank you when people give me things
- not saying hi to people when out and about

Not everyone considers these things bad manners and that's okay. But some of these I do plan on passing down to my children (not just daughters).

Some other random things I can accredit learning from my mom is never share a bank account, always clear the table and put food away right after eating, etc."

681,"I'm kinda cheating cuz this is from my dad but I don't get along with my mother, when my dad passed she called and asked if he left her any cash then never called again when he didn't. The only good thing she taught me is ""parents become parents through actions, not birth"" but my father taught me things I value and try to teach my son, he's still in that ""oh look, the cat, I'll stomp towards it"" phase but it'll kick in.... Eventually. 

What he taught me was ""Just because one person did it doesn't mean everyone did it"" and ""just because they did it doesn't mean you have to"". He got a lot of crap due to being a man, people thought because some men rely on women too much he did too so whenever he asked a female friend or sibling to do something anyone who overhead whether it be friend of said friend/sibling or a stranger would shame him for not being ""independent"" when he both planned on creating his own business, was 2nd in line to buy a business when the owner retired, saved up like 400k and more, he was far from dependent. 

A quick summery is basically I was taught to never generalize or assume based off another's actions. My dad was my hero, and he could cook, not well but not bad either. The highlight of my teens was when my dad taught my cousins and I how to cook. I'm now a foodie"
682,Oh what a blessing! My mom passed when I was 11...what I wouldn’t give to know those recipes as an adult now!

Also, that everyone is entitled to their beliefs. You don’t have to agree with them but don’t argue with them in public and don’t push your beliefs onto other people.  
Mum is a reasonably devout Christian and believes churches should welcome all as we are all sinners and let the one without sin throw the first stone... so she isn’t into worrying about what other people do in the privacy of their own home. Unless they don’t mow their lawns. If more religious people were into compassion and forgiveness, and living by example, the world would be a better place."

I'm now in the process of learning to love my body and I really really hope my daughter doesn't see the moments when I hate my body. I don't want her to hear me say I'm ugly and fat. I want her to celebrate her life and body and feel confident throughout her life. I just hope I haven't already ruined that for her"

How we were lucky because we could always grow stuff if we needed to since we had land. We weren’t doomsday preppers or anything but the subject would come up in passing like that and there was a couple guns locked up in the basement “just in case.”"
690,"For sure! 
Resume wise: you want it to be no longer than a page, and you want a fair bit of white space. It needs to be very easy to read. Reason being, your resume will probably come in a stack of others, and you want your qualifications to be clear in 30 seconds. My mom always said to assume it's being glanced at on a Friday at 5pm. You want them to put it in the 'follow up' pile instead of the trash. 

A lot of people highlight the place where they worked--highlight your job instead, again making it easy for the recruiter to see what you've done. A lot of people also add too much detail under what they've done in each job position. You need a one to two sentence description that both includes buzzwords for your profession (because nowadays we have to make it through a computer system before a person will even see your stuff), and it should be clear and concise. For example, I'm a nurse. When I edit resumes for colleagues, they include things like ""pass pills, take vitals"" in their description. The recruiter is aware that nurses pass pills and take vitals. That description is just extra, useless words. A better descriptor is ""Manage care for post surgical patients with an interdisciplinary team on a high volume unit. Experience with wound vacs and ventilators. Created a new report format and blood clot prevention form for the unit."" Now I have buzzwords (manage, care, high volume, interdisciplinary) and added experience others may not have and things I've done that go above and beyond. If they want to know more, they'll call me for an interview. 

I'd recommend a cover letter. And honestly I'd look up templates online for your job type, because it varies and I'm not as good with those.

When I go for an interview, I've looked up usual nursing interview questions online and practiced my answers. I'll also have three or four anecdotes I can use to make answers more personal. If they ask about my weakness, I tell them and then follow up with how I'm working on improving. At the end of the interview, I always tell the hiring manager that I want the job. My mom said that very few people told her that and it always left an impression. 

Hope this helps!"
691,"I *was* the same and it took 10 years but honestly now I'm completely the opposite and you can be too. 

I learned from my mother and learned to be cruel in the worst ways to the people I love most. I consider it a gift though because now I think I'm even more compassionate and thoughtful in my communication than the average person. 

It took me a while but the only real guidance I can offer is learning to immediately acknowledge to yourself when you said something (or *how* you said something) with the intent of being hurtful. The second you recognize ""yeah, I did that just to make them react"" you can follow it up and an apology and rephrase, and then you'll slowly do it less and less, and you'll get better and better at assessing everything before it comes out of your mouth. I don't even think most people have to be *that* aware of their words (because they were never *that fucked up*) - but you will be and you'll be so grateful for it."
692,These made me tear up. My grandfather recently passed of lung cancer and he always told me how hard was to lose his mom at 17! He learned how to cook and clean and passed that to his kids
693,"Like I said in another comment - I think she meant it more about the pressuring to do something you don't like than the actual threesome.

However, my mom is from a different generation and isn't as liberal as it made her sound - she's insanely jealous and holds grudges like a fucking mythical creature. So yeah, she probably also meant no threesomes.

I've since surpassed my mother in emotional maturity and now understand that you can, in fact, have a threesome with a man who loves you - provided its part of your healthy, balanced relationship that you both want. 

The crux of it is the pressuring outside of your ""consent zone"" for his sexual pleasure."
694,"Same! For me nausea is not just miserable, it gives me really-not-funny feelings of existential dread and impending doom. One minute of barfing and I'm immediately cured - I actually look forward to it because I associate vomiting with relief."
695,"My dad. He passed in August from an aggressive glioblastoma at 69 years old. He fought for 20 months after his diagnosis. 

My husband arranged for a book of his life to be compiled. My mother helped my dad recall his life story bit by bit over an entire year, taking notes once my dad couldn't hold a pen and guessing until he nodded once he couldn't speak.

My husband gave me the book for Christmas and I just got the courage this morning to read the first chapter."
696,"My mom who passed of a drug overdose 22 years ago. Our relationship was not always great but she did her best. At least she was there to see her first grandchild born before she passed 8 months later. 

My old boss, Vincent, who passed 4 years ago. He was a tough boss but a good man who by all rights should still be alive today. 

My Uncle Chris (who’s actually the uncle of a dear friend but I’m an adopted niece) who died of cancer last November and whose birthday was this past weekend. 

My friend/former colleague Billy, who died in his sleep at 45 years of age last summer. This one hurts BAD and is part of the reason I left nyc. Too many memories. 

A new* friend, John, who passed suddenly last summer after a car accident; he didn’t go to the hospital and died of internal bleeding. I’m so lucky to have met him and so sad that he’s gone. He was very young (27).

Countless other friends and family members ... 😭😭"
697,"When I was a teenager, my sister killed herself. Years have passed, but pain and sorrow do not ...

&#x200B;

Every day when I see our picture I get a very familiar pain, tears in my eye and a lot of memories. I miss her smell, her voice, her smile"
698,"I have a lot of recipes for curries that have been accumulated somehow and passed throughout the family, even though I'm Caucasian. They're all always well received and even my Indian/Pakistani friends ask for them.

Other than curries, we have recipes for the best brownies and chocolate cake."
699,I would tell you but it has been passed down through my family.
700,"There is a warm pasta salad type dish that was passed down that I love. 

Another one that was passed down that I don’t love but still learned was a jell-o salad for dessert. I don’t eat jell-o though."
701,"Depends on who is asking and why. You can just answer all the children you have birthed or you can explain in more detail if the situation calls for it. ‘I have three children, one has passed away’ or ‘I have three children’."
702,"I have an older brother who had passed away.
Whenever this question is asked to my mother, she would always answer 4 kids (my late brother included). She would then proceed to explain about how my brother passed away."
703,Are you talking about miscarriages or full term children who were born and eventually passed away?
704,"I guess it depends on whether it's appropriate and if it's their business. 

If you want to share that with someone, you could just say ""I have X children now but I had one that passed away""."
705,"My mom always says three (originally two girls and one boy. But my brother passed away two years ago at age 29). 

She never goes into details. 

I also continue to say I have two siblings, one brother and one sister. If they ask for specifics like what do they do and how old they are I usually mention my brother has passed but he would be X years old and use to do XYZ.

It’s also interesting that I stumbled across this question because my brother has been really heavy on my mind this last week. But I don’t like to vent to my mom because she can’t even say his name without balling. She had to remove all of his pictures in the house and we cremated him so she keeps his box in her bottom dressing drawer with a towel over it. She has a really hard time coping when it’s mentioned so she usually doesn’t speak specifically about him."
706,"I don't have any children that passed away, but my mom lost her oldest child due to health issues.

She would say ""my oldest child Richard went to heaven x years ago. He would've been x years old if he was still alive.""


I'd say ""I have an older brother, but he passed away before I was born."" and go to details if needed."
707,"Usually when people ask how many children you have, theyre not referring to any that have passed. But thats usually because it wouldn't occur to them

If it were me, and fortunately it isn't, I would say ""I have x amount of children, and 1 in heaven"" or however it is

That way youre not leaving out the children who have gone but they also won't ask you questions as if they were still here which could get awkward. Its best to let people know i think, but also make a point that you like talking about them, if you do, or maybe that you dont"
708,"I’ll start. My grandfather passed away today, but I will always remember the day last fall I drive down to visit him for lunch. He told me the story of how he got his name, introduced me to all his friends in his retirement home, and really took the time for us to talk in a way we’d never gotten to much before.

He was a wonderful person. I’m blessed to be his granddaughter."
709,"One of my best friends passed away about three weeks ago. This has by far been one of the most difficult times in my life. Despite the pain I am feeling, I hold onto our memories together close to my heart.

One of the fondest memories I have of her was when we were both in college and before we had our drivers license we would always travel out of our way every morning to get Starbucks. Eventually the employees at Starbucks would call us Trouble #1 and Trouble #2. I miss her everyday but I know one day I will meet her again."
710,"I'm so sorry for your loss. I lost my grandmother in January; she lived with us for most of my life. My favorite memories are of visiting her apartment when I was young (before she moved in) and her saving stale bread for us to feed the ducks at the lake near where she lived. I also loved when she played her oldies music in the car whenever she would pick me up from school and she would sing along (she was tone-deaf!). And my God, did she love John Wayne. I have probably seen every movie he's ever been in because of her. She would get so excited when his movies that she didn't own would come on TV on the Turner Classic channel, almost like a schoolgirl seeing her crush. After she passed, I held onto her John Wayne coffee mug. It's sitting on my shelf with her funeral mass card. She was a firecracker and a half and I miss her so much."
711,"I'm very sorry for your loss :( 

My great grandma used to make the best coffee I've ever had. Our whole family would gather every sunday to get some of it. I remember, even when she had trouble getting off the bed, she would make sure we all had our coffee on Sunday morning. My family moved to a different country. She passed away a few years later and my great grandfather told us that she would always make extra coffee in case we visited. Te extraño bisabuela."
712,"My maternal grandma died 17 years ago. I remember playing lots of games with her. She loved playing Yahtzee, bit even more than playing, she loved to win. It didn't matter if you were a kid, she would crush you while laughing. I miss her, but I still don't like playing Yahtzee. Haha. 

My paternal grandpa died 20 years ago. He lived on the other side of the country, so visits were rare. I have one specific memory of when he came out for my brother's wedding when I was 13. He took us all out to a fancy dinner and got a bit drunk. As we were leaving, I have him a hug goodbye and he whispered ""you're my favorite."" A moment later he pulled me back to whisper ""don't tell anyone."" I don't even care if he said that to everyone, it makes me smile to remember. 

My dad passed a year and a half ago. His health had been declining for over a decade, so it was a relief in the end to have him free from pain. Before he passed, though, he was able to be there to give me away at my wedding and he met and held my daughter. I have so many cheerful memories of him. He was a good man, and I miss him a lot. 

I'm so sorry for your loss. It's important to remember the moments we had with them and carry them with us into the future. As long as we carry the memories, we carry a part of them as well."
713,"My papa has been gone almost 16 years, but I'll never forget how kind he was. It was always little things, like sneaking extra sugar into our kool-aid because my grandma would only put a little bit in. He would give us little tasks to do and give us money for it, like we'd be peeling potatoes and he'd give us a dollar per potato. 

I had a great-aunt that I was super close with. She passed about 8 years ago. I will never forget her laugh and how much she loved to laugh. She loved to bake and would make hundreds of cookies every Christmas. I have a large family, but she knew everyone's favorite and would make a box for everyone. Near the end, she couldn't bake much anymore, but she still made my favorite cookies because I was her favorite. I miss her more than those delicious cookies. 

Finally...my dog. She passed away in March. It's silly, but she was deaf, so if I needed to wake her up, I had this stick I would gently poke her with. She would growl and then realize it was me and get this big goofy mostly toothless smile. I am convinced that there is not a dog that has lived that loved their owner as much as she loved me."
714,How hard my aunt would hug me. She passed away from ALS a few days ago and I’d like to think she was always showing us how much she loved us without knowing she’d have to leave so soon.
715,"When I was four, my parents were working a lot in December so I spent a lot of time with my grandfather, Gramps. Gramps took me outside to make a snow man,  I then threw up on it and started crying that I ruined it. He said, in his thick Greek accent, ""No no, my baby. I fix, see?"" And he just covered the vomit with more snow. XD

Then we went inside and made colorful paper chains for the Christmas tree. 

He unfortunately passed of colon cancer the next year."
716,"I remember alot from my granny. Mostly how we would shell peas together as she watched her soaps and ""the judges"". The Price Is Right theme will forever be burned in my mind lol.. She also would tape church sermons with a tape recorder and listen to them later. Didn't understand it then, but as I've gotten older (I'm 28 now) I find it to be so amazing. She also gave great advice; it was always rooted in doing what was right. When I would visit her, I'd LOATHE being dragged around to all her elderly buddies' homes but the wisdom I was able to gain from such an early age!!! Didn't realize just how much of a privilege and advantage I had. She passed in 2017. I'll forever miss her. 

A friend of mine from high school who I lost touch with passed last year around February or March. No one told me so I couldn't pay my respects. My mom actually brought it up in casual conversation when I called home MONTHS after the fact. It hurt, like it cut deep because he was only maybe 3-4 years older than me. It was sudden and unsuspected, shocked the whole town because of how it happened. That memory will always remain; not being able to pay my respects. He was a fun loving guy too. Always found a way to make anyone laugh. I wear alot of caps now because he always wore caps. His smile could light up any room."
717,"My Grandpa always has a drink in his hand and celebrated life. When I was little, he’d get out his binoculars and make a fire in the outside pit because he knew how much I loved looking at the stars at his home in the mountains. Every time he saw me, he’d say my name really loud, have the biggest smile on his face, and give me a long hug. He was such a good person. He passed away this year during quarantine."
718,"My best friend Sara (“without an ‘h’ because h’s are eww”) had a smile brighter than a lighthouse. She would do anything and everything with me she just wanted everyone to be happy and she would do what she could to achieve that. Well I had climbed a tree to paint the top branch (she was curvier) and she climbed up there with me we were just both laughing trying to help her up and once we did there we were, painting this stupid tree talking about moving to some far away place and sharing an apartment together, I miss her a lot, she passed away from child birth 3 years ago, I think about us in that tree a lot, her big smile and infectious laughter"
719,"""I'd f\*\*\* you harder if you were skinny"" or ""I'd love you more if you were skinnier"" Guess my self-esteem was non existent for me to just let that slip."
720,"""If you don't want to do it my way, you can take the cat and leave!"" Three months later, should have listened. 

NEVER deal with someone who gives ultimatums, especially when it's for something you're passionate about."
721,"""I'd really hurt any woman if i get the chance to, women are only made for us"", i let a lot pass with that asshole until i realized the guy is an incel and apparently he only got lucky because we started dating online before we met.."
722,"""You're not like all the other (women/people here/religion/race/political affiliation/etc.) I know"" or some other variation on this theme. And then followed up with disparaging remarks about all the other ones who are not like you.

This statement seems like a good thing, right? It means you are special. You aren't needy or damaged or dumb or promiscuous or whatever terrible thing it is that group of people over there, all except YOU, are guilty of.

Only life has taught me that what really usually means is, ""You are too new to have gotten upset with how I treat said group of people, so I can put you on a pedestal...for now.""And inevitably you are going to be just like ""everyone else"" on the day you stop giving this person a pass on their bad behaviors or don't live up to the fantasy in their head of how said demographic should act *according to them.*"
723,"During a romantic sunset walk on the beach my ex passionately said ""I am falling head over heels in love with you"" whilst gazing into my eyes. A few days later when he was being particularly horrible to me, I exclaimed through tears ""I though you said you loved me"", to which he responded angrily with apparent shock ""No!? I said I thought I was FALLING in love with you! I don't actually LOVE you"". I should have ran."
724,"“I don’t want to tell people we’re together [just yet].” I was young and dumb. I still don’t know what the hell the situation was but a week after he broke it off with me for being “too busy for a relationship” after a few months of blowing off my attempts to meet up he started posting all these vague-booky statuses that was building up to announcing his new girlfriend. He was (and continued to be until I finally blocked him) the king of passive-aggressive social media posting. 

Years later he messages me as if nothing ever happened wanting to go out on a date. I wanted to yell at him “YOU fucking ended it with me!!” I’m still kinda fucked up from it. I should have blocked him straight away but I endured a couple of months of him posting things like “it’s so nice to be doing things with your special someone ;) “ after never EVER posting any status of the sort while we were together. 


So yeah, if anyone doesn’t want to tell people they’re with you, get the hell out and go find someone who is proud to be with you."
725,"“You really haven’t suffered all that much”, says my ex, who has his entire college tuition, car, and any extraneous living expenses being paid for by his parents.

“You’re like a 6/10. I don’t understand why so many guys are even asking you out”, says the guy who went above and beyond to flirt and get my attention.

“Finally, you’re letting me kiss you again. You don’t really put out much”, says the guy who specifically told me I could set this at the pace I wanted and have more decision making in this relationship. 

“You’re not getting sexually harassed at work. You’re just being appreciated for looking good. Must be nice”, says the guy who has never had patients try to consistently bite his boob, get handsy with his ass, tell him how much their blood pressure is raising with you near them while their wife is out, and being told when he’s out of the room, the patient thinks about him and jacks off. All because he doesn’t like the nurses in the past that have taken care of him.

And let’s not forget that on our first official date, he complained about all the guys asking me out, saying it wasn’t decent of me to still be talking to them when they’ve done “such an unforgivable thing” but went straight ahead and told me of a disappointing date he went on the day before our date. Apparently a random girl that dropped off her number at his work counter is okay! Because it’s the first time anyone has ever done that to him! 

Whatever kind of empathy you have for someone, even if their pain is real, so is yours. You don’t have to stand for someone destroying your boundaries to help them. Don’t let a guy belittle your experiences, your decisions, ignore your boundaries, and you sure as hell don’t let him decide how pretty you are. 

*On a side note, if a guy tells me I’m interesting with having little to no interaction with me, red flag. That and giving me a nickname when I don’t even know them that well. To date, these two have saved me a lot of time without fail."
726,“I thought we were passed the Honeymoon Phase”
727,"Not that these really “slipped passed” but for some reason I just decided to ignore them??

•“You really annoy me but I still love you”

•“I think I’m gonna turn out like my dad” (who was an abusive alcoholic)

•“Being your emotional support is exhausting” and would pretty much ignore in times where I was feeling really badly and needed someone to talk to

•“If I’m being 100% honest, we would not be dating right now if we weren’t having sex”

•Coerced me into doing things I had repeatedly and explicitly said no to"
728,"Not necessarily a phrase but a situation. My grandpa, who I was very close with all my life was dying. My family told me he didn’t have much time left. I was alone at home (we lived together at the time) sobbing because the following day I was driving 4 hours to go visit him and say goodbye. My ex at the time was out with friends, when I texted him to “please come home, I don’t want to be alone right now” he replied with “why”

Secondary situation, my uncle passed unexpectedly a month later. Same scenario, he was out with friends, I was at home asking him to come home, he said “why”

I don’t know why it took me twice to shut that whole relationship down but he’s gone for good now"
729,"I passed the opportunity to devestate him when he said ""girls are more luckier than us because you can easily marry someone rich. You don't need to work"" He really meant that. Such a moron."
730,"He told me he wished I was “normal” whenever his jokes or comments which we’re negative bothered me. Told me we’d be so “good together otherwise”

Yeah, I’ll pass thx pal"
731,"When he figured out my password and broke into my accounts to read my conversations. I KNEW it was a red flag but I attributed it to his age. I should have broken up with him then. 

That guy ended up being the MOST emotionally exhaustive person I’d ever been with. I had to explain every single interaction I had with the opposite sex. You would think that after he read through my messages and didn’t find anything that he would have trusted me after that. Nope."
732,"i had been suicidal for the entirety of a 9 month relationship. around the 6 monthish mark, the mother of a friend passed away unexpectedly and it was very traumatic to my friend. i was talking about it to my boyfriend and was saying how awful my own life would be without my mother. (she was my carer at the time and still is). i said how i would hate to live without her. he looked me dead in the eyes and said ‘at the rate you’re going, you’ll be dead long before her’. that was the first time my heart had ever felt broken. i broke up with him a few months later but i wish i did it sooner."
733,"This reminds me of this I was hanging out with one of my friends and his girlfriend texted him, asking about something innocuous and non-urgent like ""what are your plans this weekend?"" Maybe 10 minutes had passed and he hadn't responded, because we were mid-conversation, so she texted him again with the same text IN ALL CAPS. He laughed it off but I've never understood why people tolerate that kind of thing."
734,"My grandpa got an STD and needed to take meds for it, and so did my gmaw to avoid passing it back and forth to each other. He didn't tell her what it was and told her she had to take these meds for her prostate (keep in mind this is the 60s/70s and we're in the deep south) and she went along with it. It wasn't until way later in therapy her therapist was like ""Mabel, you don't HAVE a prostate"" 

So don't feel bad."
735,Ugh did we date the same person? He made it sound like he had cleaned himself up already and instead began to slip deeper in as time passed smh
736,"In my experience, when people are actually averse to drama, it tends not to be something they mention because they don't really deal with a tonne of it or bother with it at all 

Hate is a passionate emotion. If you hate something that means you concern yourself with it to such an extent that it causes an emotional response from you, and typically emotional responses are followed by actions. 

So, sorry, but if you go around telling people you hate drama, what you're *really* telling them is that you can't help but get pulled into drama (or even starting it) and what you actually hate is when you end up the loser in the drama at the end. 

If you just don't engage with drama and don't announce your hate for drama, people will tend to assume that you are ambivalent to it, which is generally what most healthy individuals are looking for."
737,"Because emotionally mature people are able to recognize the difference between conflict and ""drama"" and they choose to deal with conflict and straight up ignore drama. 

If you legitimately ""hate"" something, that means you have a passionate emotional response to that thing. Hate is the opposite of calm disinterest. 

People who ""hate"" drama can't help but get pulled into it. Most people would prefer someone who is disinterested in it altogether."
738,"I actually didn’t realize how much it bothered me until he said that.

Conservative values don’t bother me. I lean left, but I have some myself. 

The fact that he explicitly said that he likes Trump is what got to me. I tried to brush it off at first because he followed it up with, “But I’m not vocal about it.” Slowly, there were little things about him that just seemed off, and I knew it was something I couldn’t get passed."
739,"*ding ding ding ding ding!*

Actual nice, generous, compassionate people don't have to tell people they are those things."
740,"Reading that other women had a similar experience makes me feel so much more... Valid? Like I'm less of an idiot for letting someone on the opposite hemisphere control my whole life for 4 years. I was a teenager and was made to feel so guilty for doing things other teens were doing because that's the only time you can get away with reckless decisions and brush past their consequences. Like silly summer loves, growing up, experimenting with passions. He was older than me and had all those experiences already, which meant me being a kid was a punishable offence.

What an idiot I was for sticking around."
741,"This was something I dealt with almost 20 years ago (I'm turning 40 next week). My mother passed away from a very aggressive brain tumor, leaving her husband (my well-meaning but...problematic step-father). My biological father (whom I was still living with while I worked and went to school part time) had major mental and physical health problems of his own, and was just unable to live a functional adult life. As much as I tried, I couldn't do anything for either of them. Neither of them were were abusive, but as a young adult dealing with her own issues and trying to come into her own, I felt more and more and more like I needed distance if I had any hope of moving forward.

Ultimately, I was able to use the tiny bit of life insurance money I got from my mother's death to move out to Los Angeles with my girlfriend and try to start my adult life and career.

The emotional distance this created between me and my fathers was really unfortunate. Neither of them were together enough to keep in touch with me very much, and I was dealing with my own emotional baggage and wasn't able to either. So for the next decade it was just a phone call with my father maybe once or twice a month...and some kind of communication with my step-father once every few months (or less). I felt horrible about this, and ultimately their lives kind of spiraled into some really unhealthy places. But...again...there was nothing I could do to save them.

My father passed away from his health problems about 5 years ago. He had moved very far away, and my wife and I had to travel to the state he had lived in to pack up his belongings and wrap up all his affairs. I had never been there before. When we walked into his apartment it was just...horrid. His hording tendencies had gotten the better of him. There was filth everywhere, and his bedroom was full of old boxes...and a cat litter box with cat poop still in it even though his cat had passed away years ago. He had been sleeping on a cheap mattress on the floor in the living room next to a small TV I had bought for him...and surrounded by photos of me :(

I don't know if I'll ever not feel regret about this. My father loved me immensely, but was too unhealthy to be able to show it. Even in our infrequent communication, we had a connection that I'm still feeling the loss of. I wish I could have done more for him. But the truth is, I had mountains of traumas of my own to overcome. And only now that I'm on the cusp of 40, and with a beautiful 7 month son my wife and I adopted as a newborn, do I think I'm strong enough to be able to handle him. He just...wasn't able to live that long.

My step-father, I keep somewhat at arm's length. But I do try to keep in touch more than I did previously. He's not able to take care of himself either, but has caretakers in his siblings so I know I'll never have to face the choices with him that I did with my father.

I think, overall, I'm saying that sometimes these choices can be difficult. they might not be ""clean"". There will be regrets. You may question this stuff for the rest of your life. But, as with me, if your parents truly love you they'll understand and support you prioritizing your own health and happiness...even over theirs."
742,"When I was twelve years old my Nana’s boyfriend passed away. My cousin and I didn’t want her to be lonely so we decided to get her a bird. We didn’t have any money or means of transportation (as we were latchkey kids). We borrowed two ill fitted bikes and left at dawn to make enough money to buy our Nana a bird. We had decided early on that we would wash cars/windshields in order to earn enough money. We washed dozens of cars and by noon we had made $30. We then embarked on a ride across town to the Petco. When we got to the Petco the sales clerk schooled us on the realities of buying a bird, which included all the bells and whistles.  (No we didn’t factor in money for a cage, toys, treats, or food/water dishes). We realized we only had enough money for 1 parakeet and a small bag of seeds. Also we were on our bikes and there was no way we would make it home with everything in hand (My feet barely touched the pedals!). Clearly we were children that did not think this completely through. The sales clerk asked us why we wanted the bird and our story touched them. They offered to get/buy us a cage and give us a discount on the food dishes... all we had to do was give them all our cash. They agreed to drop everything off to the house after their shift. We then raced home before it got too dark and waited. Several hours had passed and we feared we had been duped, but alas a knock at the door, it was the sales clerk with TWO parakeets and all the goods!!! It felt like such an amazing adventure at the time. I still think about riding our bikes into a dust cloud kicked up by a passing semi on our way to Petco hell bent on buying Nana a parakeet."
743,"D e p r e s s i o n 

My life wasn't my own as much as it was one of my parent's, which meant I grew super super depressed trying to make it in that world. Of course, friends save the day, but...I was not living how I wanted to live - and that can only be hidden for a little bit before it starts leaking out in your day-to-day existence. 

My ass should've been on medication and free to *choose* what I really wanted to do, as well as aided from my divorced and narc parents. 

Being on medication now helps a lot, and the difficulties of being a high schooler then have passed a lot since then. I learned that I'm smarter than I know and so are most people, high school and teenagery is just unfair and fucked up in (American) society"
744,"My papa’s funeral. While it was sad, he had been struggling with Alzheimer's for the last 10 years of his life. It was putting a huge strain on my nana, my dad and his siblings. When he passed away, it was like everyone could breathe again. The funeral also was like a family reunion and we reminisced about the good times in our childhoods and had lots of laughs."
745,"My dad's best friend passed away out of nowhere in 2015, literally a *week* after he came camping at the top of Scotland with us. So many of his lovely family members told us he had been so happy to go with us, he caught his first fish, felt a proper rainstorm when his tent collapsed and had told them all how much of a lovely time he had. I miss him now."
746,"One of my good friends passed away due to complications from an illness she’d had her whole life. It was simultaneously the saddest and happiest funeral I’d ever been to. She was a beautiful girl with a happy spirit, so we tried to honor her in the same way. We all wore yellow (her favorite color) to the service, brought all yellow followers, and sang her favorite songs. Her sister told funny stories about her, it was beautiful really. I think she would have liked it."
747,"I hope that my grandfather's funeral will be what he envisions. He says he wants a huge party. Singing, dancing, gathering passersby off of the streets, just to say goodbye. I hope to hell that he makes it through these Covid days so that he can have what he wishes for!"
748,"My grandma just passed away in October. A few months before she died, we found her life story that she had hand written back in 1995 which chronicled her life up until that point. She made the comment that whenever she died, it would sure be nice to have someone read it at her funeral. I volunteered to do it thinking I had quite a while to prep. However the time came much too soon. I got up there and read 19 pages of her life to everyone in attendance. We laughed, we remembered, and we cried, it was the most happiest and memorable funeral I’ve ever attended."
749,"When my Grandma passed, rather than a funeral, we gathered in her apartment. Just the women of the family were there, and we made her famous cinnamon buns and played her country tapes and laughed and reminisced and giggled and cried. We all wore pink, which was her favorite colour.  It was perfect. She would have loved it. Miss you Grams 💖💓"
750,"2016, when my brothers gf passed away from crohns. It was raining pretty hard that day. During the service almost everyone who went up, including my brother, told great memories that made us all laugh. My son was around 3 and while he didn't fully understand what was going on, he helped with the laughter and love that filled the room. Once the service was done, the rain let up and the the sun started to poke out from the clouds while we were at the cemetery. It really was a beautiful funeral."
751,"My grandma passed away a few years ago, and she always said that when she goes she just wants to be cremated and her ashes spread out at her favourite spot. I don't know how it is in other places but throwing away human ash is considered littering where I am from and is highly illegal. Usually the remains are handed out in a urn with a vacuum sealed hard plastic bag inside that goes into a wall you can visit.  Anyways, after the memorial service, around 13 of us went to Grandma's fav spot, which also happened to be a popular hiking place for people. 

My family is a very ""sharing is caring"" type, so they decided that everyone gets a turn at spreading grandma's ashes, so whenever someone turn started my mom and aunt would loudly say ""makes sure there will be enough for everyone"". In the mean time it's around -10 degrees, people are walking their dogs, there are some serious hikers nodding hello, while my cousin, last in line to spread her,  just realises that more than half of grandma is  left in the bag. It was so comical that everyone was so contemplative, saying goodbye, crying and remembering how great this woman was, and then my mom and aunt start discussing if we should just do another round of spreading her, because ""it's only fair"". 

Meanwhile,  my brother and i just started laughing hysterically because my grandma would have called us idiots for going through so much trouble, we are freezing our asses off, looking out to see if anybody has called the police/rangers, and my cousin is still pouring everything out of the bag halfway screaming: ""it's okay now, you are free, you were so small, how is this even possible??""

Then we all went home, had a beer, ending a difficult and sad  day on a happy note. It's a memory that is funny and sweet, which is so fitting to how my grandma was. Damn, I miss her so much."
752,"My step mom did an assisted suicide after a long battle with ALS. She had a celebration of life, we were all drinking mimosas and crying with her, it was really beautiful. She passed away with all of us around watching the sunset from her favorite spot in the house. It was sad, but so meaningful."
753,"My grandma and grandpa went to the same restaurant every day of the week. Except the restaurant was closed on Sundays so they went somewhere else on Wednesdays. They did this for years.

When my grandma passed away each restaurant sent flowers to the funeral home. Neither restaurant wanted to be outdone by the other so they kept sending more and more. It turned into a turf war of flowers. We couldn't stop laughing every time more flowers were delivered.

Also, a lady showed up to the wake wearing the same outfit my grandmother was wearing in the casket. My brother and I took a poll of who wore it better."
754,"My grandpa passed away close to Thanksgiving, but he knew he was going to pass. He asked his kids to have a memorial for him in Cinco de Mayo. He loved spending time in Mexico and my grandma was from Ensenada; she passed at a young age, but she was the love of his life. He wanted us to have a celebration of life for him and my grandma since they would finally be together again. My aunts and mom made a ton of tamales, carne asada, spanish rice, homemade refried beans, barbacoa, and lots of other mexican dishes using my grandma's recipes. My uncle hired a mariachi band and tended bar that day. There was lots of joy, laughter, reminiscing, and love. I got to see pictures of my grandma with my grandpa, him in his Marine dress uniform and her in a traditional mexican wedding dress with lace frills and a train that went on forever. We drank margaritas and danced to the mariachi music, we talked and laughed, drank and ate until we were bursting at the seams. It was a wonderful day."
755,"I work as a personal trainer for cancer patients. Several years ago I had a client go down hill very quickly. I saw her in the hospital a week before she passed. She knew I loved high heels, so she made me promise to wear my tallest sexiest heels to her funeral. I honored her wish and at her very religious, Christian funeral I wore shiny black very sexy open toed 5” heels. I could almost hear her chuckling at me. I still miss her."
756,"My friends mom passed away right before our senior year in high school. It was incredibly sad, she was really young (heart complications) and we were all upset at the funeral. Their house was always where we went to hang out. Her parents let us sleep over and have a few parties and stuff. (Not like ragers or anything but like 5 or 6 of us at a time)

Anyway, we had tons of memories at the funeral. We had a lot of fun there. The kids and friends mostly stayed outside so we weren’t actually disrupting the grieving but we still talk about that day a lot and I know her mom wouldn’t have cared. I miss that woman a lot."
757,"Probably my MIL a few years ago. She had a really long journey with cancer: she had undergone another round of chemo and radiation  she was told she was 'in the clear' by her doctors, and passed about 6 months later. Her passing was incredibly difficult on my husband and our extended family. Especially as she decided to pass at home where she was more comfortable (with a few equipment rentals). 

Their family is SUPER Catholic (not a judgement, just a fact) and you could see how much peace the ability to convene and pray as a community helped start the grieving process. My husband delivered her eulogy and helping him prepare for it was cathartic for certain. One of the uncles hosted a small get together following the service and we ended up sitting in the sun, drinking margaritas (mom's celebratory drink of choice) and sharing stories."
758,"My great-aunt died a few years ago, her quality of life was almost non-existent at the end. When I heard about her death, I was relieved. My grandma's cat died a few weeks before, I had more tears for her than for my great-aunt.

She taught piano to many children in her village and she wasn't a very nice teacher. 6 people at her funeral altogether, including 4 family members who ""had"" to be there.

The pastor mispronounced her name a few times. He told us of her good nature and her helpfulness. We giggled all the way through. The meal afterwards was a celebration. When our hostess came to tell us her sympathies and we told her who died, she couldn't hold back her grin.

You see, my great-aunt used to beat each and every last one of her pupils, my mum included, but everyone in town wanted for their child to be a musician or at least play one instrument, so they sent their kids to her. Also, beating a child was permitted then (it isn't now). Since she died in her late 80s and not much of that generation is left in town, everyone hated her. I think some of them danced on her grave. She was a miserable old woman who liked making others miserable as well."
759,I have my first dog's name tag on my keyring. He passed in 2007.
760,"I don't keep this on me because I'm scared I'll lose it or my bag will get stolen but in my closet, I have my dad's wallet that still has everything in it from 2004 when he had a heart attack and died that night.  The hospital staff emptied his pockets and his wallet was one of the personal items they gave back to us.  In that wallet, are his bus tickets, his license, cash and the worn-out paper with our cell phone numbers written on them.  I take those things out once in a while to look at them; just thinking about that, even after all these years, still makes me cry (like now 😥)"
761,Pictures of me and mother in my purse she passed away when I was 15 but I feel like I have her with me.
762,A rosary my grandpa gave me before he passed away.
763,A keychain my mom got me from North Carolina when I was 7. My grandfather had passed away so she flew over for his funeral. It may just be a keychain but I feel like I always have my grandfather with me. I love it.
764,"I have a few things in mind, but there's one story I thought of that fits this.

Months before the pandemic, I had taken a trip to the local library where they had new, used and old library books half off what they usually sell them for. One was a new book I got because I had read a book by the same author and the other was a book I hadn't seen in a long time. It was a book called ""Storybound"" and it was a book I read in middle school about a girl who gets transported to a world of fairy tales. It was the first of two books, but the first book was the only one I read and the only one there so I bought it. I've read it a few times for nostalgia, but I bought it to add to my collection of books I want to pass down to my kids. Right with my other old books from middle and elementary school."
765,"Sentimental jewelleries & journals.

I would also like to save some aspects of my culture and the cooking to pass onto my children."
766,"I have a necklace from my grandmother that I hope to pass down.  We were very close, and I’m sad they’ll never get to meet her."
767,My dad gave me his yes in the round shirt from 1969 and a grateful dead tank from the 80s that I cherished. Some trashy girl I went to high school with had a junkie friend of hers at her house and stole them while I was babysitting her damned kid. That was like 15 years ago and I'm still passed about it!!!
768,"My Dad was always old, so I grew up my whole life knowing he might pass away while I was young. So I prepared by spending as much time with him as possible, and asking him all sorts of questions about his life etc. He passed away from cancer when I was 19, and I had alot of closure because i grew up living like this.

But there is always going to be the one more question or one more moment you wish you could have. It's always small things like, I'll remember a memory he told me, but now I want to know the finer details like what year was that, what else happened etc....or I'll have a dream of him, and I'll go to hug him but I'll wake up. Its moments like that my heart hurts but I'm just super grateful I got to know my Dad."
769,"Nothing that I wish I had asked in particular but I wish that I had said 'I love you'. 

My family is not the best with emotional expression. 

I'm sure he knew but it would have been nice for him to hear it. 

He passed away last year suddenly from cardiac arrest."
770,"I wish I would have asked for more recipes. He suddenly passed a few years after my grandmother (his mom) died and we lost a lot of family recipes that were never written down. I'm a decent baker and can get close to the same cookies and such, but it'll never be exactly as I remember. 


My dad was never one to be in photos. I only have a handful of them between my high school graduation and his passing 6 years later, one of which is from my grandmother's funeral. I'd love to have more pictures of and with him. 


Because my parents had been divorced for a few years at that time, I also wish we would have known where his important info was as a general precaution. Bank accounts, life insurance, cash, mortgage info, etc. was not easy to find and that's a big deal when someone is gone unexpectedly."
771,"That's a really good one. I dreamt the other day of my grandpa who's passed away, trying to take a picture with him to have one last souvenir, it broke my heart."
772,"My mother adopted a cat a few years before I was born, and he was my constant companion until he passed when I was in middle school.  He was a lazy, dumb cat (the best kind) who didn't mind being carried around or dressed in doll clothes.  He slept in my crib when I was a baby, and continued to sleep in my bed every night.  When he got too old and sick to jump into bed, I slept on the floor with him."
773,He was a guinea pig. He was mostly very shy. He passed away because he got out once and spent the whole time eating my plastic dollhouse. :(
774,"That sounds like a great way to get somebody's passwort security question ;) 

But seriously: we had a female abyssinian guinea pig in caramel and white. I know you're not supposed to keep them singular but I was seven or eight and my mom said so. She was allowed to roam the apartment freely all day and would come to the sofa to lick our feet. However, she would only walk on carpet because she didn't like how her little feet slipped on hardwood floors.

When she wasn't even a year old, my dad stepped on her. My mom rushed her to the vet, while my dad stayed home feeling immensely guilty. She broke her hip but the vet said she'd make it. And she did and died at the ripe age of nine years. Which is rather old for guinea pigs. 

She was a good pig and had all of the cute habits – whistling when she heard us using the salad dryer and answering with a deep sound when we slapped our thighs. She also loved cucumber peels and parsley. She especially loved eating the fringes of our parents' persian rugs. My mom tried to stop her, rubbing them in perfume samples. But when it wore off, she'd be back at it again."
775,"Trigger Warning (TW): I will mention medical infections, operations and pet passing. It's quite a sad story, honestly.

My first pet was a Persian cat. He was such a wonderful and quiet animal. He did not need to talk nor make a sound, his presence was calming enough. I loved him with my entire being. I'll always say he used all of his 7 lives and did not waste a single one. He lost an eye when he was young because of an infection. Then a year before his passing, he was staying with my grandma while we were on vacation, he got disoriented and fell from a window, four floors onto the ground. Luckily the only thing he broke were his front paws. 

He accompanied me during most of my school years, high school and during my senior years. Sadly, we had to put him down because when he fell, he probably also hit his chin onto the ground, which caused him to get one of his tooth so infected it literally started eating him from inside out. As he was really old and weak we could not operate him because the chances of him passing on the operation table were very high. The only thing we could do is let him live as much as he wanted to live.

I remember begging him when he was already weak to survive to see me get into my dream college, and he did. He lived for seven more months when his life expectancy was two weeks max. The same day we put him down I got the results of my university entry exam. I got in. 

I still miss him everyday. But he taught me many valuable lessons and helped me get through very hard times mentally and I will be forever thankful."
776,"My first pet outside of family pets was my dog Kelsie. She was a shih tzu/poodle. Sadly, she passed away a little under a year ago. 

She was such a great little dog with a huge personality. She was a yappy little thing and did not like strangers, but man did that dog love me. Kelsie was deaf for the latter half of her life. She also survived cancer at the young age of 7. She absolutely loved cats. When we brought our kitten home, she would cry if the kitten wasn't in her sight. She also really loved kids, especially one of my nieces and my son. 

She was there with me when I had my kid, during my worst breakup, and stuck around just long enough for me to get married. She was there to cuddle away any sadness. If I cried, she would immediately jump on my lap and comfort me. The night before she died, she was having trouble walking. She could barely get out of her bed, but she got up so she could find a spot to stare at me. She just laid there and stared at me for a couple hours. I think she knew her time was up, even if I didn't know it at the time. 

I miss her so much."
777,A golden retriever. He was a loving and protective good doggo. It’s been more than 10 years since he passed away and I still miss him.
778,"It was a couple of years ago, at Christmas. We were all gathered at my parents' house. For some reason I just couldn't sleep, so I got up and wandered downstairs to find my brother still up as well, wrapping presents for his daughter at like 2 am. I sat down and helped him out. Then we watched Mom and Dad Save The Planet and Jingle All The Way. At one point we were both hungry, so he got up and made us waffles with peanut butter and syrup. We just sat and laughed and smoked outside, just the two of us, enjoying each other's company in the tiny hours of Christmas morning, waiting for everyone else to get up.

He passed away 18 months ago. So that memory is even more precious to me, and when I'm truly missing him I make myself remember when we sat on the couch together, holding the plate of santa cookies and arguing over which of us would be able to take the most perfect bite of a cookie so my niece would know that santa had enjoyed them."
779,"One night I was tucking my brother (7) and my sister (4) into bed and reading them a bedtime story. I'm 23 and live away for college so always made a point of tucking them in when I was home.

I was wedged between the two of them in their bed after finishing a story (they slept together every night), my little sister rolled over and fell asleep. When we realised she was asleep, my brother and I gave each other a knowing glance, turned to each other and started cuddling, limbs intertwined. We both said 'I love you', and he just looked at me with the most beautiful expression I have ever seen, with complete and utter love and happiness. He cupped my face with his little hands and I rubbed his back.

I'll never forget how I felt at that moment. Two months later he passed away in his sleep, unexpectedly. He was my best friend and showed me the true meaning of love. It will always be the most precious moment in my life."
780,"man my precious memories stem from dark places. let's see.... well one was like 4 years ago. I was laying in bed having a really bad day with my depression not able to get out of bed. My SO insisted I just lay there and not worry about a thing and just left me alone and took over with the kids. My son who was almost three at the time managed to get pass her. He waddled his way to my room and asked what was wrong. Told him nothing was wrong mommy just felt really really sad and just needed to get some sleep. He looked around and found one of his starter books on my floor from when I read to him the other night and picked it up and crawled into bed with me and say. ""K well i read mommy story for bed time."" He then made sure I was tucked in and cuddled up and read me a story before giving me a kiss on the head and getting caught in the room by my SO. I explained he was reading mommy a story for nap time and she hauled him off telling him to let her now before he runs off like that again. Then got him excited to watch my little pony with his sister with the promise he could watch team umi zoomi or blippi after. it really put into perspective how important little things like his bedtime routine was to him and how it made him feel and how special it was to him."
781,"When I just graduated high school my parents filed bankruptcy and we lost everything. We had to move from our big house in a nice neighborhood to a small one bedroom apartment next to a strip club. We lost our two cars and had to take the bus everywhere. A family of 7 sharing a 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom, with a kitchen so small you could put you hands on either wall, you would think this would be awful but it was the best 2 years in my families' life. We smiled and laughed all the time, we were grateful that we even had a place and that we were together. The engery in that small little apartment was so positive we even had friends ask to stay the night and more with us. We took turns sleeping in the bed, I slept in the closet most of the time. 

We had lost everything but having all those material things kept us apart. Losing it brought us closer together. To this day, I pass that little apartment on my way to my condo on the beach, I look at it and smile, grateful they haven't torn it down yet. The strip club was torn down by the way. Since then I've lost my mom to cancer, my dad to illness, and my sister to drugs but I still have those 2 years ingrained in my memory."
782,My time with the grandpa on both sides before they passed away. The people who believed in me when I felt like I deserved nothing.
783,"My kitty passed away just a month and a half ago. I can completely relate. I had to put her to sleep (cancer). It was the hardest decision I ever made in my life. I will never have a pet again because even though I had 14 wonderful years with her, the pain of losing her was/is too unbearable."
784,"You SMASHED it! Passing must have been a big confidence boost. 


Greater things await!"
785,"I’m so sorry to hear about your kitty, too. Mine was put to sleep, too (he had a stroke) and it’s horrendous isn’t it? I was not ready to say goodbye to him. You probably feel the same as me - gone way before their time 💖💖"
786,"I come from a tiny European town and we live in three generation homes, so I grew up with one set of grandparents living in the same house as me. They picked me up from day care with their bikes, cooked me lunch, played with me, watched TV, took me on walkes with our dog, tucked me in at night when my parents were out. When I went off to university I hopped on a two hour long train ride to visit them every weekend. And when they passed away it was the worst pain I had and have ever felt. 

I promised to visit their grave as often as possible, and I do. I live on a different continent now, but I try to be there multiple times a year. I also keep in contact with their siblings and I have their pictures and wedding bands. Thinking about getting a tattoo to honor them."
787,"Hmm, my grandparents on my mom’s side are Japanese so I never really got to speak to them much as I didn’t know the language growing up. Regardless, my grandpa and I had a good relationship as we bonded over sports and the dream that I’d study in Japan. My grandma and I are closest as we bonded over lots of things such as cooking and baking, comedies, art, and more. She’s a very gentle and patient soul that never fails to cheer me up with her good company and yummy food. Although she also wants me to come study in Japan so she’s been urging me to pick up Japanese lately😅

My grandparent’s on my dad’s side are from the States and have both passed long ago. I never got to meet my grandfather since he passed before I was born but I’ve heard a lot about him and really admire him. My grandmother was a very kind and quick-witted woman who taught me a lot. She also always had the best games (video games/sports/etc), answers to my many questions, bandages to patch me up, my favorite cereals stocked up, and a witty comeback for anyone and everyone.

I miss them a lot but I’ll be sure to make many more good memories with my grandma!!😁"
788,"When I was little, we would always all get together at some point in the summers in Maine and I would see them. They were both always really nice to me and I had no complaints. Eventually though they didn't want to keep flying out to Maine so instead we started visiting them in their home in California.  They passed away in 2011 and 2018."
789,"My maternal grandma pretty much raised me, she passed 10 years ago and I miss her every day. My grandpa died before I was born.

Paternal grandparents, no relationship at all. I see my grandma every few years and the dude that's supposed to be my grandfather hasnt seen my face in 30 years."
790,"Basically non existent

My paternal grandparents loved me,  but were too poor and sick to visit me,  and we couldn't afford to visit them.  They wrote me letters, and I got to see them in person 3 or 4 times in my life before they died when I was a teen.  I really enjoyed my time with them,  but I don't have many memories.  I wish I could have gotten to know them.  

My maternal grandparents apparently had no interest in me whatsoever. I don't remember them ever making an effort to visit me,  have me visit them,  write to me,  call me.  That was especially sad,  because they both lived into my mid thirties,  so I lost a lot of time in a different way.  I remember hearing my grandmother had passed,  and my first thought was how inconvenient it was going to be to attend her funeral. Which is awful. But she was a stranger to me.  

An elderly widower lived across the street from me when I was a kid.  He had no grandchildren of his own,  and he adopted me and my siblings.  He accompanied me to my school's annual grandparents luncheon,  which I had never been able to attend before.  He brought me flowers.  He never forgot my birthday. He walked me home from school when he was feeling up to it. He died at the age of 102. I got to be with him. He was my real grandfather.

Edit: wow I haven't cried for Old Ed in almost thirty years,  but here I go."
791,I was close to both sides. My Dad farmed two farms and his parents lived on one. My maternal grandparents lived 20 minutes away and I visited a lot with my Mom. They all passed before I was 20.
792,"Two of my grandparents passed before I was born, but the remaining two are/were polar opposites (my grandfather passed a few years ago).

My grandfather loved me to pieces; it was no secret that I was the favorite grandchild (and he didn't have many). He loved hearing my stories, seeing my art projects, laughed when I loudly blurted out an opinion, watched movies/TV with me just to see what my world was. I was 11 the last time I saw him, and then his health started failing and his wife (not my grandmother) went out of her way to distance him from my family. He was not the nicest of people- but he loved me, so my relationship with him and memories are very complex. He passed while I was in college and I couldn't get time off work to go to the funeral; I am furious at him for some things he used to say to my mom, but I'm also a little sad that he never got to see me graduate from college or meet my BF. It was complex. But I know he loved me.

My grandma, on the other hand, is still alive. And hates me. Mostly because I am my mother's daughter and she hates my mom for the simple reason that is: My mom is not Catholic. Yeah. It's ah... A very weird thing, especially since my mom and I are Christian's, just not of the Catholic variety (before someone comes at me and asks did we do anything to insult her, no- my grandma tried to insist that my mom convert when my parents first got married, she said no, and for that my grandma has always hated her). So, I've been called an illegitimate child to my face and it used to really upset me. Doesn't anymore but it was hella annoying for a while. Oh, and she swears she's also the reincarnation of a holy figure in the Catholic church and gets very upset when people question her about that. Doesn't help also that while she despises me and calls me every insult in the book, she adores my sister and they have so much fun together."
793,"My mom's father died when I was 11 years old. Before that we had a pretty good relationship with them. After the death my already strange and cold grandma turned even colder. I don't have a need to stay in touch with her and she is not interested in my life either.

With my father's side I had a rather formal relationship. We visited there every two months. But my mother kept telling all this bs about them all the time so I was afraid as a child to trust them or have a close relationship. 

Later in teenage I realised the problem was my mother, not other people. I started bonding more with my father's mother. My father's father was a man of few words so we didn't talk much. But he was ok. He passed away in an accident last year. I keep in touch with my father's mother every once in a while. I live in another country now so we send messages on whatsapp. We are not super close but she is supportive and I sense she wants the best for us. Even though sometimes she's expecting too much.

Overall grandparents or relatives are not that important for me. My mom made sure to spoil every relationship we had to her side of family. And my father's side is just very... restrained I guess?"
794,"I think this anecdote counts.

I was at the grocery store at the busiest time. This man in his 50's was blocking the path and kind of walking backwards while he said hi a friend over his shoulder. I said, ""Excuse me,"" because I couldn't get past him. It was loud enough for him to hear, but he ignored me. So I shouldered my way past him. After I passed, he said, ""mumble-mumble-mumble, ya cold ass bitch!"" By the time it registered what he'd said I was an aisle and a half away. I spun around and said, ""HEY! I said 'excuse me,' but *you* didn't move! That's no reason to call me a BITCH!""

 Like I said, it was the busiest time, so 10-15 people witnessed that interaction. He didn't say anything more (what could he say?) and I went about my shopping."
795,"5 Years later he messaged me and apologized for everything. I can tell he wants to prove to me he's changed but, so many years have passed. I don't have the same taste, I have no feelings for him anymore. Didn't open old wounds, it was healing knowing that I know I'd never be with him again lmao"
796,"Yes. We had met up six months after the breakup. It was my first time seeing him in person. He wanted to say goodbye because he was moving across the country. (California). A lot inside of me thought he were going to eventually get back together. We spent three hours at the restaurant catching up. In the end I broke down crying saying I was scared I’d never find someone I’d love as much as him and he kind of reassured me before making a cocky ass statement about how he set the bar really high and how it probably would be hard for me. The sad part is that I believed him. I kept some contact in some sick way of still wanting to be apart of his life. It wasn’t healthy for me in any way. And I did a lot of the reaching out and him gently ignoring me. 

Eventually (ONE AND A HALF YEARS LATER) I moved on. Blocked him. And didn’t say anything else on my way out. About a year after I unblocked him. He actually reached out to me two months ago (it’s been over three years now) and I got a quick whiff of why I was okay with moving on. 

He was a really cocky dude. A lot of the “catching up” was his way to display how amazing his life is and how he’s doing. There was a lot of emphasis on that which makes me feel like if you have to emphasize that, then you’re probably not having a good time lol. 

I kind of just let him speak and then he ended the conversation with him going to bed (I barely got a three words in) lol. But that’s about it. deep down I still feel a sting of betrayal. But I think about what my brother told me in the midst of this chaotic breakup, that you’ll always love that person deep down and that the feeling of being hurt is always there but with time you’ll learn how to cope and manage the hurt better. (Ironically my brother passed away two years ago and now I use this advice towards him)

I’m a million times better. No contact is the hardest but best way to go. 

So yea. Crazy times 😂

12/10 would not do that again lol"
797,I try to make sure first that the attractive person really is getting a pass because of their looks and I'm not being biased. I don't like people who just assume automatically that someone got a pass without actually looking into it. Then I make a note inside my head of people who gave the pass and try to distance myself from those people. I don't distance myself from the attractive person unless I know for sure that the attractive person is using their looks to get a pass.
798,"As an average white person who loves cooking anything and everything, I'll just pass on recipes."
799,"Family bond. I grew up in a very close knit family.  Aunts, uncles cousins. A lot of the time a lot of us under one roof.  My family has always been the one consistent good thing in my life."
800,"Lunar new year and mid autumn festival celebration with mooncakes. Making dumplings/wontons and family style meals. Some of my fondest memories with my family is when we make a large batch of food together. Also our enjoyment of all kinds of fruit.

Also our love for the outdoors, not really from our culture but more of how we bond as a couple. We definitely will pass this onto our kid."
801,"If I ever have kids, I hope I could pass on family recipes. I think recipes are a nice story of where your family has come from (my grandparents were born in the US, but they grew up on recipes from their grandparents who were from other countries, and we still use them).

I also hope to pass on Halloween."
802,"Considering I'm a very lazy individual, smoking weed & napping. If I wanted to feel productive and pass time, however, cleaning is a great way to eat away time!"
803,Reading is the best way to pass time
804,"Most of my friends are far away so those relationships are pretty unchanged-some I've gotten to talk to more as we have more downtime but like the ones I have a regular call or zoom schedule with that hasn't changed. My one good friend in the area who lives alone and is taking COVID as seriously as I am and I have gone on a few hikes, which is nice to get out of the house. The thing I'm really missing is more surface level/passive interactions, like sitting in a coffee shop or even playing sports. They can wait, though.  


I've also taken up a few new hobbies and improved my cooking skills. I can knit now and make a damn good vegan carbonara.

&#x200B;

That said I don't get along with my roommate and she told me that ""mature adults don't feel lonely"" when I mentioned working from home was getting old so it's been almost more isolating in that respect than living alone."
805,"There are so many ways to stay in touch virtually, and that is all well and good, but I have also found focusing on what I do to pass the time when not talking to friends is so important for me. Doing things that engage my mind like reading or listening to interesting podcasts or working out or even cleaning my house etc help me pass the time and forget I’m alone while sitting down and watching tv every free moment really amplifies the loneliness to me. So just balancing out my time has been helpful."
806,"As long as I wouldn't die by asphyxiation on the way up and I had a parachute, I'd go all the way. The universe is a beautiful thing, why pass the opportunity to experience it? Life is too short to pass up experiences like that, and I've always been one for astronomy."
807,"Super annoyed. But it's better than quiet, mean, passive aggressive comments."
808,"I don’t care. I don’t find yelling intimidating by itself. Don’t cuss at me, do not ever physically intimidate (let alone touch) me but yelling? Won’t help you make your case but whatever. 

I suppose it would bother me if it happened in public, or now that we have a child if it happened where he could hear it - though my husband is the quiet angry type, so no personal experience with that.

I can’t say I get why people are so up in arms about this (traumatic experiences exempted), I’ll take a yeller over passive aggression any day of the week. But that’s just me 🤷🏻‍♀️"
809,"I don't think it's an inherently less mature to yell vs to entirely shut down (I personally am less bothered by yellers because shutting down feels like a weird power flex to me in which they have sole control over whether the issue is going to be solved). Both are emotional regressions that frankly everyone is entitled to once and a while as reactions to pain, grief, bad situations, etc.

Anger is a human emotion and it's very weird to say that experiencing it is wrong or bad or try to police how other people feel pain. I think it's extremely inappropriate that people pass judgments on other's intelligence based on how they react to pain-if their reaction is harmful to you, it's on you to leave the situation-and that goes for any reaction.  


If someone is screaming at a coworker for like misplacing a pen, yeah that's inappropriate to the situation and not great (although I'd say most of the time that's not the problem and there's something else going on there)."
810,i deal and wait for it to pass later silently judging their character and lack of self control. unfortunately this would be my mother.
811,I automatically categorize them as (emotionally) stupid. Sometimes I infantilize them because it’s my passive aggressive way of getting back at them for being ridiculous.
812,"The only time I think its ever warranted is when someone is talking over someone who refuses to shut up. You know the talkative people who talk but when its someone else turn they interject and talk over them. 

For those that yell immediately over the silliest stuff like something dropping by accident, or someone asking whats wrong and gets an aggressive response to hell with those types because they piss me off the most. If they do it consistently its verbal abuse to me at that point. I keep my distance with these types of people because if I blow up right back I don't feel that great about it. Almost want to fight that person, to avoid that feeling I might give my two thoughts and hurry up and go to a different location space to calm down. As long as they don't follow me or continue yelling it might be fixable. If its not fixable, ill always tell them bye."
813,"If it's rare... I get it. It happens. We're all human. It's not OK to shame someone for it.

If it's common? I cant really be around that. It's draining. I still wont shame them or anything, but it's not my thing. I wouldn't be able to put up with a yeller as a partner for damn sure lol. I'd just think they're emotionally childish if it's persistent."
814,"God, same. My parents still do this and it's infuriating. My partner wanted that type of relationship and I was a hard pass on that."
815,I'd take some yelling (light though) over passive aggression too lol and I had trauma around it... but I obviously still prefer emotionally mature.
816,"I'm sorry for the loss of your boy. Pets give us thousands of wonderful days and one really, really shitty one.

I have a memorial plaque in my house. Whenever a pet passes away, I write their name on it. It's prominently displayed, so every time I walk by it, I tend to see at least one name. And then I force myself to remember a good memory of them.

I also sometimes go back through old photos, if they're available. Unfortunately for awhile there I was really bad at taking pictures, so I don't have many, but I can still look back through the ones I have and smile as I remember how cute/funny/affectionate they were. 

Also, when I feel the time is there, I'll start looking for a new baby. The loss of a pet is always terrible, but I like to think of it as making room in my home for another pet who deserves a forever home as well. Not a replacement, nothing can ever replace a beloved pet, but there's now space for another member of my silly furry family."
817,"I absolutely fell apart for a good 6 months after one of my cats passed back in 2018. Probably took a full year to completely recover. He was my emotional support animal and we'd bonded incredibly strongly, plus he was my first cat.

Part of me recovering was getting kittens. I know it doesn't work for everyone, but I needed that energy in my life."
818,"Don't really have anything to add because the only time I had a pet was when I was very young, and I don't have too many memories about him (he was a dog, and died pretty soon).

But... I grieve a lot about cherished pets from my friends that end up passing away. Somehow, I feel very attached to them, and when my friends end up telling me that something came to happen to their pets, I can't help but feel terribly filled with sadness.

I remember this cat (he was called Fred) that my friend would always take pictures of to show me. He didn't have a home apparently, so my friend took him in. The kitty was just so cute, always with a sleepy face on, barely open eyes, and he had huge, adorable paws. I soon felt like he was my own cat. And one day when I heard that he got hit by a car and died... I got so sad, powerless, but also very mad with my friend for letting him out in the streets. The thought of never seeing him again, even though I didn't interact with him too much, in a way made me feel like I had lost something very important to me. I wanted so much to shout ""why didn't you take better care of him?!""

It probably can't compare to having lived with a pet for more than 10 years like some people do, but I guess my love for animals and their different personalities is one of the most genuine feelings I've experienced. And if I did have a pet... I can't even imagine how much I'd cry if they died, lol."
819,"I also got kittens, about 9 months after my first cat passed away (I adopted him when he was six and he lived to be 21, so I had a lot of time with him). 

I live by myself and besides missing him I suddenly had to deal with living in a truly empty home and I totally needed more cat energy in my life, but it took a good 6 months before that didn't feel like 'betraying' my old cat."
820,"Take the course again. If it's not related to competency, use all of the resources available to you, and all the self-discipline you can muster, to pass the class."
821,">if your grade was unrelated to competency/material mastery?

>bad study habits, bad time management/planning,

These are related to competency as a student. 

If I've done poorly in a necessary course, I retook the class and used all of the resources the college offered to pass it successfully."
822,"I failed my first statistics exam and passed the course with the lowest possible passing grade (pretty sure the TA took pity on me). I now have a PhD in psychology, with a specialization in statistical methods. 

My poor grade was due to stress from a shitty relationship. I ended that relationship, then went on to take a higher level stats course and got an A+. Then I studied extra hard for the psychology subject GRE and got the maximum score on the statistics portion. I also picked an independent research project that required a complicated statistical method and self-taught. I ended up getting into my PhD program because of my expertise in statistics specifically, lol. 

So, you just gotta prove you're better at it now. Growth is a positive thing!"
823,"I was never one to have anxiety as a teenager (I am now 22) and occasionally pass out (reason unknown). This has given me GREAT anxiety. So bad that I feel like I can't breath and will pass out. I take deep breaths (sounds silly, but it works). I also put a cold rag on my neck and tell myself that I am okay."
824,"I had a grapefruit sized tumor when I was 20 that nearly caused sepsis from killing an ovary and internal bleeding. I then found out I have endo. And then PCOS. And another autoimmune disorder. And bipolar 2. I was honestly angry for a while because my brother is a picture of health. I felt cheated out of a “normal” life. But now that I have them all under control, I just have kind of accepted it. I try not to minimize my problems, but I force myself to put it into perspective. Yeah, okay, it’s a little harder for me to lose weight, but at least I have working legs and arms that allow me to be mobile. I journal a fair amount about how all these things affect me internally. I also make jokes that my warranty expired ten years ago. It’s been all downhill from there!"
825,"I passed out 2 years ago and it still is something I get anxious about. I have never had broken bones, good health, never been to the hospital for myself till that incident. They couldn’t figure out the reason and said it was most likely a random drop in blood sugar.

Every time I get a panic attack that’s my first thought. I usually just drink a glass of juice for reassurance but it’s still something I ruminate on. The last panic attack, I was hyper focused on what if I have a stroke or what if I go “crazy”."
826,"Passive aggression. It’s the most unproductive shit and pisses me off so much. 

I make a point to confront people who do it just to keep it out of my life. They’re doing it because they fear actual confrontation, so you have to show them that it gets them confrontation anyway for it to stop."
827,When people are inconsistent asf. I've had friends withdraw and communicate but frankly I appreciate the warning
828,"I can not stand when I'm riding my bike and someone else on a bike rides up in front of me at a red light, then they ride slow so I have to pass them. Then they get in front of me at the next red light!!! Like, dude, I'm faster than you!! Stop doing that!!"
829,"> but I do get cycle rage 

Omg, I thought I was the only one! 🤣

Edit: I also HATE when someone in a car is being over accommodating. Like when I'm over a block away and the person is stopped at an intersection (the ones without lights/crosswalks) just waiting for me to pass and there are no cars passing by.. so it ends up making me feel like I gotta be the one to hurry up and pass them first."
830,"Especially when they're in the left lane... where I live, the left lane is the passing lane. The least a slow driver can do is just move over to the right. When they won't even do that, I get so aggro!!"
831,"it feels wrong to even type this out, but probably having wished my parents passed on so that i could commit in peace"
832,"I’ve thought that perhaps it was good (?) my dad passed at the “right” time. He died in 2015. Do not get me wrong, I MISS HIM every single day. I loved my dad. I only get these thoughts when I think of things that make me myself that I now (learned from mom) know he would disapprove on. He would never approve my hair (I’ll never go back to long hair), coloring my hair (let alone multiple times), how I am not straight (pansexual, and usually more attracted to women- I’m a woman), or even being able to go out late with friends. I don’t even know if he would’ve liked to find out I got a boyfriend in junior year- he was so protective and joked in ways to where he might have gotten a bad impression on my then boyfriend. Apparently, he was more racist, anti lgbtq+, bad republic, and sexist than I knew- but since he died before I went to high school when I branched out, I never got to discover him like that. I can see myself arguing with him about this stuff, and the ONLY time I thought perhaps it was better he passed at that time? I am so happy how I can be myself now, and I would not change that for the world.. and can’t help but wonder how sad I’d be if he happened to be alive now and probably restricted how I could be myself. It’s the most selfish thought, I think, I’ve ever had. Mom thinks this too, who is none of the things Dad was like, and we never mean to be bad about it, but we can’t help get these thoughts in our heads! Even though we miss him. We also believe that things in life, bad or good, happen for a reason.. so this is something we’ve thought and talked about."
833,"I have been involved in several serious car accidents (never my fault, i have been a passenger in all of them) and I have a fear of dying that way. To the point where I almost have a panic attack if the driver is going too fast.

So every time I’m in a car, every curve it makes, every highway I’m on, I visualize a way that it can go wrong and create major car accidents in my head. 
If I’m driving alone, I constantly think about yeeting onto another car and picture my car going up in the air and flipping over. I can’t help it, it’s always on the back of my mind
I’m not crazy btw, just terrified of car accidents"
834,"Someone I knew had just committed suicide (he was my peer at the time, both of us teenagers) and I was in Spirit Halloween with my mom shopping and we passed a Ouija Board, and I had an invasive thought to tell my mom that “we should get that for _his moms name_”. I thankfully did not say that out loud"
835,I have so many. I honestly want the people I love to die cos they irritated me that badly. When I see small people I wanna hit them with my car when im driving. It's a passing thought okay. My mind has a form of tourettes too. In a sense. I always think of the worst thing to say but I dont say it
836,"I know many professional musicians, singer/songwriters, etc. and I just didn't have the immense passion or drive for music that they had, and that is required if you're going to build a career in that field. I still love playing music and singing, but the career I eventually chose (writing) is a source of a lot more passion and determination for me."
837,"This sounds mild, no blood, no gore, no emergency hospital trips... I managed to get two consecutive slipped disks by stretching before I got out of bed.

That sounds like nothing, but I spent the next month and a half bedridden, in agony (a genuine 10 on the scale for me). I couldn't sleep, move, sit for more than 10 minutes, I was stiff all the time. I still had to go out, still had chores and jobs to do, but simply struggled with everything.

It's not just that certain movements caused pain. There was a baseline pain there 24/7, if I triggered that extra pain from movement or even just sitting/standing without moving too long I ended up in so much pain I literally passed out. 

If I sat for too long my lower back and legs went numb. My thighs would ache, I got cramps in my legs. My arms hurt from having to use them to lug my body around. I once got stuck to the floor and basically just had to lay on my back sleeping there until it calmed down enough to try and move again.

Then randomly, one morning I woke up and it was all back to normal. 

Back injuries run in the family, my mum and gran had similar problems, my mum actually had some of her spine operated on to try and fix some of her problems.

Edit, for comparison, my second worst injury, which I'd put as a 7 or 8 on the pain scale, was where I degloved my ankle by walking just 1 mile in boots that weren't broken in."
838,"I had been renting a townhouse for years from a private owner. Stuff had been left in the backyard. (Weathered/ broken umbrella, weathered chairs, a rusty 'portable' rod iron fire pit)

I finally got permission to get rid of the stuff. Most of it was easy to break down and dispose of. But that stupid fire pit was heavy AF and hard to move on the uneven tile that was on the patio. 

One summer night, I had a drink or two, was out back smoking just glaring at this ugly thing and finally had enough. I figured if I could get it to the wall, I could find a way to leverage it over the wall. Since I lived in the corner of my street, the dumpsters were close, so I could drag it the rest of the way.  (I didn't want to take it through my house. It was filthy, rusty, super gross)

So I was pushing and pulling this stupid thing, sweating bc even at 8pm it was still like 98*F outside. I was so close to my backyard patio wall when it got stuck in the grout indentation of tile. So I took a deep breath and pushed with all my strength, but my right hand slipped. I fell forward and one of the rusty rod iron bars when straight through my arm, from the base my palm, up past my wrist. 

I did what I medically know you shouldn't do, I pulled my arm up and ripped it away from the bar. 

Went to my bathroom, realized it was bleeding really bad, grabbed a hand towel and tried to apply pressure. The rest is pretty fuzzy, but I know I called 911 (blood on my phone and conversation length noted in my phone history)

I guess I told the operator I would open the front door, bc it was unlocked and open when they found me passed out on my bathroom floor(I never used my front door- garage was attached,  so I had to have gotten up and opened it which is probably what made me pass out). Once I passed out, obviously pressure was no longer being applied, so I was quickly bleeding out. Luckily I lived within a few blocks of the hospital. 

I vaguely remember the paramedics and ER. I remember my OP nurse who was super sweet to me, talking about how much she liked my Alice in Wonderland tattoos(such a random flash of a memory), before I was rolled into emergency surgery. And then I was out until 2 days later. 

I had blood transfusions, apparently my surgery took over 6 hours and a few different drs in there working on me. 

I have permanent damage. The bottom part of my palm is numb 24/7. I have constant pain near the tendon that was repaired. Plus a gross scar. 

So ya. I'm a world class klutz. Just none of my episodes have nearly killed me before. So that's my ultimate story of being a dumbass klutz."
839,"I used to think of it as ""temporarily dating myself."" I'd get ready the same way I would for an exciting date. Put some fun music on, take your time getting ready, dance around in your undies... Give yourself little things to get excited about. Get out there and go for a hike or a walk. Take amazing photos. Play a video game like Skyrim or something that appeals to you... Just try to embrace this period in your life. It's growth. It's change. It's a prerequisite to the rest of your life. A right of passage...a vision quest. 

When you ""date yourself,"" you end up trying new things, living unapologetically, and discovering things you never knew you liked. This is the phase where you think up a ""version"" of you that you think is awesome. (Positive visualization! Imagine what you will be, and do what you must do to get there. It's fun once you get into it.)

Good luck.

Also side note: everyone is lonely right now with this pandemic. Nothing about this is normal. It's 100% okay to acknowledge that and just call a friend and say, ""dude. I'm lonely."" Lean on your friends and family when you need to, and do your best to make your life as fun and healthy as possible during this time.

I hope you find your flow very soon! Good things await."
840,"Writing poetry and journaling help me during those times. It's always good to acknowledge your feelings. Try to be patient with yourself. And like I said, do what you can to make life more enjoyable. This will pass!"
841,"I am so, so sad for her and her family. She fought so hard to live and I hope she had peace when she passed. There was so much on her shoulders."
842,"I’m saddened by her passing but even more saddened about the chauvinist pig that’s probably going to end up in her place. RBG was a great lady, and to anyone Trump wants in her place women will probably just be ovaries that walk."
843,"Xpost from witches against patriarchy

I'm so heart broken right now. I feel like she was one of the last bastions of light holding this shit show together. I lit candles for her a lot this year. And I'm lighting one last one tonight. Thank you, RBG.

I'm trying do hard to keep that light in my own heart. But the existential nihilism is real dark right now.

I can't wait for the anger stage of grief. gonna take it to the fucking streets if that lizard alien Cruz gets it. Call your reps, everyone."
844,"I'm setting aside my political conclusions for now to mourn a legend. RGB consistently fought tooth and nail for the women who would come after her. That is the embodiment of my core beliefs; build a better world than the one you were given. To keep going back, until her death, fighting cancer, over and over? Badassery. 

I'll be saddened by her passing for a long time, and grateful for her fight for longer."
845,I’m heartbroken for her passing because she was a champion for women’s rights. I’m pissed that her passing is at a time when we’re not allowed to leave the US. Because now I truly want to drive to Canada and never come back
846,"Her passing is a great loss. We will keep pushing forward, and doing better for social rights. She inspired countless people to fight for justice, and those people are going to keep pressing forward. 

We also have to recognize that RBG wasnt perfect, and learn from her mistakes. She has a history of hurting the BIPOC community; supporting piplines through indigenous land, fast-tracked deportations, and endorsed eugenics as a motivation for supporting legal abortion. Its important that we recognize these failings as we push onward with social justice to make sure we are fighting for justice for all."
847,"I knew she didn't have much longer left but I wasn't expecting her to pass away during Trump's presidency. Like others already said, McConnell's hypocrisy is gonna become extremely obvious. The senate is going to rush to appoint a conservative judge. Even if Biden wins, they'll make sure a new judge is in before January."
848,"Yeah thinking the same. She was an impressive woman, lived a long life and hopefully loved it, but it’s scary how one person can bring so much turmoil. If our Mama Merkel would pass away or our president, we mourn and that’s it."
849,"If you already know some of this stuff, my apologies for over-explaining: 

The US government is split into three branches Executive (the president), Legislative (Congress = House + Senate), and Judicial (Supreme Court). Each of these branches are designed to essentially have equal power as part of our checks and balances system. 

Therefore, the Supreme Court has the power to overturn any US law and any executive order passed by the president if they find grounds to do so based on the US constitution. They can also reverse uno card it and overturn any previous Supreme Court rulings.

The court consists of 9 ""Justices"" that must be nominated by the president and then confirmed through a vote in the US Senate. Justices have lifetime tenure, which was meant as another power check, intending to make them more impartial since they wouldn't have to worry about losing their seat due to an unpopular decision. 

However, this lifetime tenure also becomes a power play, because if a Justice vacates their seat (by retiring or dying), whoever is in power at the time gets to pick the next one, and then that person is in there for life, influencing policy decisions for decades afterwards. Right now, 3 Justices in the court were appointed by George W Bush, 1 was appointed by Clinton, 2 were appointed by Obama, and since Trump's presidency he has appointed 2. Now, since Ginsburg (who was appointed by Clinton) has passed away, he's about to get a third, essentially giving the Court a Conservative majority 6-3. 

This is frightening to people because many important progressive US laws (gay marriage, abortion, etc) were upheld by landmark Court rulings that could now potentially be overturned. It also means that currently, all three branches of US government are Conservative by majority. People are also angry because the last time a seat was vacated was 2016 during Obama's presidency, and the Republican-majority Senate refused to confirm Obama's nomination using the excuse of ""it's inappropriate to confirm a Justice during an election year,"" when the election was 11 months out. Now, the Republican-majority Senate is saying ""It's fine to confirm a Justice during an election year,"" while the election is 50 days away.

Besides all that mess, Ginsburg herself was a beloved icon in US culture for being a trailblazer for women in Law from the 1960s onward and overcame sexist discrimination to reach the absolute pinnacle. She was a defender of civil liberties, challenged sexist policy, and helped uphold progressive policymaking in the US. The movie On the Basis of Sex was made about her. She will be missed."
850,"I am a liberal freak, and have been planning a move to Europe for some years anyhow (pre Trump), but truly no politician should be a holy beacon. As much I wanted Sanders to win the nomination, I was upset that a rather large number didn't vote- not even by mail. What happened? Not even my best friend did, who claimed to support him as well- but didn't bother to vote. If she had time to be on IG she had time to vote.

I am currently back in my hometown with my family because of COVID-19, and the county is rather conservative- much to the disadvantage of my small, migrant, left-leaning town. Even with a trickle of slightly more progressive policies passing in recent years, you still can't even drink the water here. And no Supreme Court Justice made that possible, if anything, her death has further fueled my wish for term limits of Justices- regardless of whether she was more aligned politically with me or not."
851,"I failed the written permit test like 2-3 times and the driving test once before passing...remember you can always retry and it's not a huge deal! Not like some tests that are super expensive and only offered twice a year, like the bar or something"
852,"I was soo nervous, I honestly was kind of shaking while driving too. I would recommend driving around the streets of the dmv to get comfortable and used to the area before. Also just take it slow and steady. Maybe give yourself a pep talk before too to hype yourself up. You got this! Take it from someone that took 6+ months to learn how to drive and was still scared to drive after passing my test. if I could do it, anyone could do it."
853,"I practiced until I cried the day of, then my mom yelled at me and then I went to go take the test. I passed! Basically just get the nerves about before by stressing yourself out in advance. Only if of course you wont stay stressed out. I have like an upper limit and once I hit that point I'm very calm."
854,"I didn’t have the $8 for the retest so my uncle paid for it. I said, “well, I’m either going to pass or he’s going to be really disappointed.”"
855,"I was so nervous because I knew my examiner was known as being harsh. So I just  told myself I just have no other choice and I wouldn't be the first one to fail. 

While the driving test I just talked and asked random things from the examiner. Probably hoping that if we talk more then he wouldn't  notice my mistakes. I passed the test."
856,"I work Monday-Friday in a customer service job and would consider myself introverted, so I love nothing more than coming home and being alone. 

That being said, I do feel lonely every now and then. I have plenty of friends I see often so it’s more due to being single. I usually just let the feeling pass"
857,"To pass the time, I learn something. I read, I audit online MOOCs, I download learning apps that teach other languages, coding, or really anything, I listen to podcasts and join in the conversation.  The learning apps and online courses tend to connect to larger learning communities, so there is human interaction in the discussion boards.

I also do all the other stuff like visit the library, call friends, volunteer, join community clubs.  

In the last few years I have really crossed the line between solitude and lonliness.   I hope I can get back to solitude, but I've found for lonliness there is no way to keep it away, I have just learned to spend my day with it.  So, these activities do not stop the lonliness for me, they just give me something to do while being lonely."
858,I was fortunate enough to speak with her the night before she passed.
859,"There are things I used to be accepting of but are now a hard pass. 

But any previous dealbreakers I’ve had are all still dealbreakers."
860,"When I was a teenager my friends and I always judged boys by their feet and shoes. We claimed to be ""grossed out"".



My husband consistently wears nothing but flip flops unless he HAS to wear shoes, and the only time his toenails get trimmed is if I do it."
861,My grandpa just passed three days ago. Not well. Couldn’t visit him all year in his assisted living home. Had a stroke and was gone a few hours later. He was only a couple weeks shy of 97.
862,"My grandma is going to die sometime in the next few weeks.  We can't definitively pin it on COVID, but she tested positive, got pneumonia, ""recovered,"" and now her body is just shutting down (she refuses food and water).

She's been declining physically and mentally for a long time, so it's not unexpected.  I've lost close loved ones before, so none of this is new either.  I'm sure the grief will still hit me hard when she actually passes though.  She was always one of my heroes growing up."
863,"I lost both my grandpas in november. I could not visit them both in the hospital to say a final goodbye because both of them live in other countries. I was hit really hard when my grandpa on my fathers side of the family. It was my first time loosing a family member.  I had to take some time off from my workplace.

A couple weeks later i began to feel a little better. I got a phone call from my mom, she told me that my grandpa on my moms side also passed away. I broke down crying. I felt broken. It was like something broke inside of me. I dont know how to describe it.

I am still grieving but i have resumed my daily routine."
864,"How do I feel ? How can I express this motolov cocktail inside me ? I’m missing my uncle. And at the same time, guilt, anger, sadness and anxiety are knocking at my door. The endless “I should have” list is killing me and my brain is begging for some rest. 

How I feel ? I don’t know but all I can say is that I’m smiling and trying to pass my exams"
865,"When I had them, it started with extreme nausea where I couldn’t even keep Gatorade down (it felt like a stomach bug). I then had to go to the ER for fluids and pain meds and was surprised when they told me it was kidney stones. The next day, all that was left was the pain after I passed one. It was debilitating. The cramps lasted a few hours after each and it was awful.

Edit: Added information."
866,"My first started with a very dull twinge on my lower right side. It slowly got a little worse as the day went on until I was doubled over and had to go to the ER, thinking it was appendix. 

The second was a bit different. I woke up and it was weird to pee. Like there was a bit of a blockage and I had to really push it out. Then not too much time later I got the pain again in the same spot but it started worse. I had a bad feeling so I hopped in the shower really quick. By the time I got out I was doubled over again and went straight to the ER. 

Mine were both very small and passed relatively easy after getting to the hospital and getting some pain meds. Sorry if you’re going through this. I honestly felt this was more painful than birth."
867,I have night terrors since my brother's passing. He killed himself. I wake up sobbing and crying hysterically at night. I miss him and love him
868,"Lost my 2 year old cat to cancer very unexpectedly last month. She was my whole world. I raised her from only 5 days old. I always thought I'd never be able to love a human child as much as I loved my cat. The connection we had was just too strong. 

Every night I try to fall asleep without her in my arms I cant help but just sob uncontrollably until I am passed out. I miss her so much every second of every day."
869,"~2 ywars ago. I was catching an uber home from a meeting, as soon as I shut the door I found out my friend passed away. I had only spoken to her a few days prior and it really hit me. I sobbed the whole journey home on the phone to my mum, and couldn't stop for the rest of the evening. (The uber driver was very kind to me and I appreciated that)."
870,"My grandmother had passed away from pancreatic cancer last year and I couldn’t make it back up north for her funeral due to money reasons. I remember when I first heard of her passing it was all very numb. But when it hit me that the next time I travel to visit my family she will actually not be there smiling and cooking for the family as she always loved to do, I cried like a baby in my bfs arms all night. Just typing this now makes me tear up. At least now she’s no longer in pain, pancreatic cancer took her so painfully and quickly."
871,Honestly? Its been about a year since I've sobbed. The last time I can clearly remember ugly crying was when my dad passed away without a warning at the age of 60 last year.
872,"In the first week of May, when my government finally announced that they would arrange flights to take their citizens home. 
I spent half of March and all of April living in an almost apocalyptic scene- first all my flatmates moved out, just disappeared on me as they caught last minute flights back home. I live in student halls with mostly international students, so everyday I would hear atleast 3 students drag their suitcases away right below my window, and leave for their respective houses.

I felt like the last person alive. I would just sit by myself in my room all day waiting for when I'd get to go home. In retrospect, there was no serious emergency, but the pandemic made me feel like I would never see my family again. 

The day I finally got the news that I could go back home, I literally burst out crying. I have never cried that way before. It's how you see people crying when someone they know passes away. It was half scream and half cry. I swear, if my flatmates were still around and heard it, they would have freaked the fuck out. 

I made it home safely. I've spent 3 months here with my family and it was very healing. Now I'm going back in a couple weeks."
873,"I was at work with a brand new trainee, and another guy who was kind of still a trainee, as he had only been there like 2 weeks. And the general manager, who was breathing down my neck. Despite being incredibly adept at my job, he was micromanaging and stressing me out for no reason, which ended up causing me to perform at lower than my personal standards. Of course then, at a point when both of my trainees are doing other work and are not nearby, and when I had recently just passed a corner (to literally do a task for my job), I hear my general manager shit talk us to the other employees, wondering how there were 3 of us, but no one to be found. I promptly went to the bathroom and rage and stress sobbed for what had to be something around 20 minutes. Of course, I then returned to find out that one of the other managers had gone to the bathroom during the time I was there, and ended up telling everyone that I was crying. Fuck people"
874,My grandfather passed away today. It was the first time i’ve ever sat with someone till the very end and I sat with him for about ten minutes after he passed. After i finally let go i hugged my mom and scream sobbed realizing that would be the last time I’d be with him
875,Yesterday after my grandma tested positive for COVID-19. If I lose her I'm done. Hate that I did everything safe and stayed inside only for someone else who wasn't wearing a mask/taking it seriously to pass it on to her anyways (her husband).
876,"When a mum friend passed away from cancer 2.5 years ago, leaving behind a daughter who was about to turn 2. We were in the same antenatal class and gave birth within a month of each other and had grown so close so quickly. Seeing her deteriorate within a few months but managing to marry her best friend a month before she passed was so emotional for us all."
877,"About a week ago, when I found out my favorite aunt passed away. She had breast cancer many years, and went into remission, but the cancer came back and took her life. I had just talked to her on my son's birthday in July about planning a get together with my son and I, and my cousin and her sons. She told me she had ""a few more years in me"". I was destroyed for a while after."
878,"The day after we postponed our wedding due to COVID (April date postponed to October and now October cancelled) last week. My father has terminal cancer, wanted to see me and my long term partner get married  before he dies and now will most likely pass away before we are able to be together again. I cried for two days straight."
879,Hugs to you. I hope it passes as quick as it can
880,"Oh that is so so hard. My heart goes out to you. My father passed from organ failure related to years of chemo. I remember trying to take care of my mum during that time. Honestly, it has only been 5-7 years after his death that I am able to process it. Hugs to you random internet friend."
881,"My father passed away 8 months ago from cancer as well. Those final days are the hardest, even when you know it's their time. You sound so strong taking care of your family like that. Don't forget to take care of yourself too. You can't pour into others when your cup is empty. 
Sending love your way ❤"
882,Thank you internet friend. I am sorry for your loss. The final days are so difficult. Even when you know their pain will be over once they pass
883,"I’m so sorry, that is really awful. The lack of compassion from your own father to his daughter and granddaughters is really baffling. I hope that the two of you and your twin girls are okay now.

Edit: why the downvotes? Just curious"
884,"I was worried about forgetting memories with my old pet so the night she passed I took some time to right down a bunch of things that she did that made her unique and memories we had. Helped immensely! Talking about it with others makes a big difference too! Eventually, when you’re ready, adopting a new pet is great! There’s an infinite amount of love to give to animals"
885,My cat but she was more of my child but she  just pass away Dec 15 tomorrow it is going to mark the 1 month without her. I been having a hard time moving on cause I keep waiting for her to come around or I sometimes think I hear her bell. I sometimes have dreams of her to. I'm sorry about you grieving to :(.
886,"It absolutely guts me. I dread it every time I get a pet and it never gets easier. Usually we end up getting a new pet asap (usually a few weeks) after one passes because it's a distraction and a way to fill the gaping hole. After my old dog died, it physically hurt not to have a wiggly butt greeting you at the door and the house felt too quiet. You can never replace them, but you can fall in love with a new pet again. It takes time to bond with a new animal, but by the time I do I've had a chance to grieve and been busy getting them trained without becoming a useless depression lump in the interim."
887,I’m also very sorry to hear of your baby’s passing :(
888,I too have mistakenly called my other cats by our recently passed on kitty’s name and I have to catch myself and feel weird. I also think I hear her sometimes in another room or behind me etc. it is rough.. :(
889,"My mother passed away right after I graduated college and got married ( I was 24). My father passed away soon after and it was very... Traumatic. I was 27. As an only child, these were my best friends and it seemed impossible to keep relationships that I had, make new ones, etc.

I went through a lot of mixed emotions, obviously depression, but I became very angry and would lash out at people. I was angry because I felt life wasn't fair and I suddenly had this awakening to how cruel the world was. I had night terrors constantly, I had issues seeing blood, hearing screaming, etc. They sent me into a panic.

I was diagnosed with PTSD and sought therapy. After a year, I'm significantly better than I was. I still yearn for conversations with my parents. They bless me with talks in my dreams but I run a business and it would be nice to show them what I've accomplished. I miss their phone calls. When I'm sick, I miss their cooking and care. There are a lot of small details I miss and yearn for but I find myself trying to make new memories with my husband and friends.

I find that tradition was a large part of my childhood and the memories associated with my parents so I'm trying to create new ones to look forward to. I'm not forgetting my parents, but rather, I've read that chapter and now I'm opening the next."
890,"Kept with the day to day, it's really all you can do. My dad was killed in an accident right after I turned 20 and my mom died suddenly due to a heart attack 3 years ago.

You are never the same. It has honestly impacted every single facet of my life"
891,"Right, so I was really close to my mum. Only child of a single parent. Losing her was really hard. After that, in the space of about 3 years I moved jobs twice, relocated across the country twice and got married. I also distanced myself from some relatives who were very bad to my mum, but whom my mum had wanted me to keep in my life whilst she was still alive (complicated). All very interlinked.

Specifically to deal with losing my mum, I went on anti-depressants for about a year and did two spells in therapy. The first was after a year and it was specific grief counselling. I had a great therapist, fantastic rapport and it helped a lot. I couldn’t have done it right away though, it was too raw.   


I also had some therapy soon after the grief counselling, to help me deal with my parent’s divorce, which was long and messy, and my subsequent attitude to dating/relationships. I’d parked a lot of it in adolescence, but losing my mum brought a lot of that stuff back up. The therapist was pretty good, had an ok but not great connection with them. It helped some but it was a bit of a dead end.

My dad died a few years later. Wasn’t close to him- very limited contact since childhood. Messy circumstances with step-family around the time of his passing. Went to grief counselling again very briefly. Most of the things that arose were to do with my parent’s divorce again, so worked through those myself with the help of,a,friend with a similar background. That helped as much as anything is going to help.

It’s been over 10 years now since my mum died. At about the seven year mark I started to remember things with real joy rather than through a lens of pain. I think this took longer for me than it often because I looked after her in the terminal stages of breast cancer and I probably had some form of PTSD from that. But PTSD awareness wasn’t the same 10 years ago as it is now.

It really helped me to do a few things. Firstly, light a candle for her every evening in the run up to Christmas and for a while after. Secondly, to keep buying a gift for her birthday and at Christmas. Something she would have liked.

Finally, making a gift in her memory to the local art gallery. She was an artist and also a teacher (literature rather than art). So the gift was directed towards community art programmes that reach out to kids and vulnerable people. There’s a little plaque on a wall I can go and visit when I miss her. It wasn’t a huge gift or anything, they’re just thoughtful like that."
892,"Mom passed away 10 years ago. I fell to pieces with grief for a bit, and I know she'd hate that. I also got a graduate degree, established a career, bought a house, and a few other things that I think she'd be proud of."
893,"Tried to make my mum proud, honestly. My mum passed away when i was 14 (am now 23) and it was really tough. She had cancer from when I was 7, so most of my memories are of her being sick in some way or another as she went into remission twice but it came back. My dad was heartbroken so while he tried his best, he wasnt really there for me and we quickly developed into a flatmate situation more than parent/child where he would work and do laundry, but i would make dinner and clear up after. 

I was exceptionally lucky in having an amazing partner, who had unfortunately lost his mum not long beforehand. We had started dating a couple of months before my mum passed, and she loved him to bits too which was awesome, and we're still together. If it weren't for him, i'd be in a much worse situation cos i started self harming and that was when my depression/anxiety started to kick in. 

So I focused on my studies in getting into college, then uni and now a full time job in something vaguely related to my degree. It gets easier over time as, like someone else said, you start to be able to look back at the good times and acknowledge the bad for what they were. I kept looking forward and try not to look back too often as its still quite painful. But life goes on and they'd want you to be happy"
894,"I am an only child and was raised by a single mother, who passed away when I was 18. 

My entire world fell apart and I really struggled to keep it together. I didn't do too well at uni and with other responsibilities.

Seven years on and I am still trying to put the pieces back together."
895,"After my dad and mom passed away within 2 years of each other, almost 11 years ago, I needed space, a lot of it, just to be by myself for a while. 

I still need those, and I have days where I wanted to sleep all day. I made myself get out of bed and get on with my life just to keep up appearances, especially during Thanksgiving and Christmas. 

I had to do the usual day to day routine to survive, to keep myself occupied, just so I wouldn’t feel sad, but it wasn’t that successful. There are days when out of nowhere I would cry my eyes out, and times when I just want to be left alone. 

My grandpa passed away a month and a half ago, and while it was expected, as he was suffering from dementia, it still hurts. I’m managing all I can for now, day by day. Writing has been my therapy, as it has helped me so much. Also, talking to my sister, my aunt, and my cousins has helped things be less painful.  

I’m managing, but I know now that I don’t have to do it alone."
896,"My dad passed away when I was 18. We were never insanely close, but he was a great dad and super fun to be around. His death was very sudden (heart attack), so I guess that was what messed me up the most.

In the hours after his death, I did nothing. I didn't even cry. Then I broke down. Then I got into business mode. Wanted to go get the death certificate, fix everything for everyone who went to the funeral, support my mom and sister, etc.

Then I moved back to where I was living (I was 1000 miles away studying but was visiting when it happened), tried to go back to my normal student life, managed to do it for maybe a week, and stopped attending classes. I started having a lot of issues, pains in random places, shivers, feeling like warm water would run down parts of my body when I wasn't even sweaty. Looked for doctors, got diagnosed with a condition that is basically inflammation of the center of your ribcage (reason why I always had ""heart pain""), treated that, and ultimately ended up seeing a psychiatrist because I had not grieved and my mind was causing at least 90% of my ailments. Antidepressants helped a lot, then I found a job and moved on with my life.

It's been many years, but every time I visit I still expect to see him there, and I still catch myself speaking of him as if he's still alive. It was not easy, and becoming completely functional again took me 2-3 years. 

Tl;dr it was a very sudden death, and it messed me up emotionally and physically, then was able to ""move on"" after a few years. Some days I miss him so much I cry."
897,Thank you for your prayers. I wish the best for your family. You are amazing to take care of your sister like that. I wish I did more for my mom. I have a lot of regret that I didn't tell her things before she passed away. It's definitely hard during the holidays.
898,Same here. I'm 27 and I feel so lucky I still have both my parents but I feel like there's a high chance I'm gonna lose my shit when my mom passes. I'll be equally as devastated about my dad but even thinking of losing my mom makes me wanna cry.
899,"I want to hear experiences, please. Someone in the family has an ectopic pregnancy and she got methotrexate 2 weeks ago. Her level went from 4000 to 1000 in the past 1.5 weeks. She has mild abdominal pain which she's told is expected but sharp pain indicates a rupture so I want to know your experiences with a ruptured tube from an ectopic pregnancy. What are your experience from a ruptured tube? like:

&#x200B;

Did you know?

&#x200B;

Did you not know?

&#x200B;

Did you pass out?

&#x200B;

Did you continue doing tings without knowing?

&#x200B;

Did you hemorrhage?

&#x200B;

Did you scream in pain?

&#x200B;

Did your pain constantly persist?

&#x200B;

etc.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Looking for symptoms and behavior after a rupture occurred. TIA."
900,"Passing out from pain, vomiting through pain, being unable to move with out screaming, vomiting, passing out.. you would know if your  tube has ruptured"
901," I'd like to add that the Bechdel test is meant to illustrate how little representation women are given in popular media. It's a condemnation of films as a genre, not meant to be used as a measure of an individual work's representation of women. 


 I think the [Mako Mori test](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Mako_Mori_test) does a better job of judging how women are portrayed in a specific piece.  To pass the test, there needs to be:

a) at least one female character;

b) who gets her own narrative arc; 

c) that is not about supporting a man’s story."
902,"Copy pasting from [this article](https://www.the-unedit.com/posts/2018/8/20/7-tests-that-arent-the-bechdel-test-that-measure-movies-for-gender-equality-and-representation)

The DuVernay test: 
Coined as the Bechdel Test for race, to pass the DuVernay Test, an African American character — or a character of another minority — must have ‘fully realised’ lives, with their own desires, rather than serving as background characters (see: the black friend) for white plotlines.

The Waithe Test: 
Founded by: Lena Waithe
Waithe’s criteria focuses solely on the representation of the black woman, a character which is all too often stereotyped. To pass the Waithe Test, the film has to feature a black woman who exists within a position of power and is in a healthy relationship.

The Villalobos test:
Founded by: Ligiah Villalobos
The Villalobos Test focuses on representation for Latina women and fighting common stereotypes. Firstly, there must be a Latina lead, and subsequently the lead — or another Latina character — must be shown as professional or college educated, as well as speaking unaccented English, and must not be sexualised (as a key character trait).

The Ko test:
Founded by: Naomi Ko
Ko’s criteria opens up a broader conversation around intersectionality and gender equality in film. To pass, the movie must feature a non-white, female-identifying person who has lines in at least five scenes, and speaks English.

The Peirce test:
Founded by: Kimberly Peirce
The Peirce Test focuses on the depth of female characters, with criteria being as follows: There must be a female character (protagonist or antagonist) with her own story, who has dimension and exists in an authentic way, showcasing her needs and desires which she ultimately pursues (creating action). In addition, the viewer has to also be able to understand or empathise with her and her needs/actions.

The Villarreal test:
Founded by: Lindsey Villarreal
This test is slightly more complex in its ways. A film is immediately failed if a leading female character is introduced in the film as a typical female stereotype. This includes her being sexualised, cold or heartless, or being presented as a matriarch. However, a film that fails this first criterion can salvage itself, provided that it passes with at least three of the following four things: she must have a career with a position of authority or power, be a mother, be reckless (or makes bad decisions), or be sexual/create or choose their own sexual identity.

The Landau test:
Founded by: Noga Landau
The criteria for the Landau Test focuses more on what a film shouldn’t have. A film fails if: a main female character ends up dead, pregnant, or if she causes a plot problem for a male protagonist."
903,"This is not really in answer to your question but it is why I really liked ghostbusters (new one). It passed, and passed with flying colours I think they only had one conversation in the whole film about a man. Most of it was about career, reputation, money, ghosts and Chinese food."
904,"I wouldn’t add anything to it and would rather get rid of it entirely. 

I don’t think art exists to please anyone or fit into any moral narrative. Art should not be restricted by what other people demand it to be. 

I’m pretty sure many movies I love wouldn’t pass the Bechdel test and I couldn’t care less because I don’t need a character to be a woman in order for me to identify with them."
905,"Inspired by the character from Pacific Rim. There was only one named female character in the movie so it didn't pass the Bechdel test, but she was the lead.  There's a bunch of other [ media tests](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Media_test) from that site as well, and that's just for feminism. I'm sure googling  ""media tests"" should get similar things for race, gender identity and other under represented groups."
906,"It’s also interesting to see which movies DO pass the Bechdel Test. For example, American Pie passes it, but is probably one of the most sexist movies I’ve personally ever seen."
907,"Kidney stones were nothing, but I had doc's permission to go home for three of them and lay into a six pack of beer. 


Alcohol should never, ever be used as medicine, except I managed to pass 3 medium to large stones with a minimal amount of blood and pain without lithotripsy. Had to pee through a strainer in order to capture the stones for the lab, which became progressively harder with each beer, but it worked and I didn't even need antibiotics. 


Birth was murder, I had two 3rd degree tears. 79 stitches. My sweet baby has her father's giant Charlie Brown head."
908,"Kidney stone is way worse.  Way. Worse. The pain never stops, until the stone passes, which could be days, and often you can't get pain relief. Unless you want to pay for a visit to the ER."
909,Kidney stone stuck for a week then a stent from my kidney to bladder for SIX long ass weeks. Most painful thing I have ever been thru! Went to the ER 4 times before I asked how much longer the stone would take to pass.. 🤦‍♀️ almost exactly a year later had a stone on the other side. Had to have 911 called. I was delirious from the pain and honestly don’t remember much besides BEGGING the paramedic to help me. They had to carry me down two flights of stairs. Was blessed with another stent 🤦‍♀️ Worst pain ever. 20/10 wouldn’t even wish it on my worst enemy
910,My wife passed a kidney stone WHILE being induced unsuccessfully! It was AWFUL! Finally passed the stone and had a C-section. That’s a level of tough I can only imagine!
911,"I have kidney stones pretty often, and I've learned a couple things. Preparation and knowing what to expect is key:

\- See a Urologist every 3-6 months. They can take an X-Ray or a CT Scan and see exactly what's going on, and do lithotripsy, which isn't easy, but way easier and significantly cheaper than having kidney stones and going to the ER.

\- Keep Norco on hand. Norco doesn't make me nauseous, and is very potent. I take Motrin when the pain isn't too bad, but when it gets really bad, Norco literally saves me from having to go to the hospital, where they will try to give me morphine which makes me even more nauseous. Or if I tell them I don't want morphine, they will give me Norco, so very little reason to go to the hospital if I already have what they would give me! (and I know the stone isn't too big to pass, because I get scanned regularly)

\- If nausea is a big problem for you like it is for me, try to get a prescription of Zofran and Phenergan. Also have bread on hand to nibble on because it helps so so much. I prefer Ezekiel.

\- As soon as you start experiencing pain, schedule an appointment with your Urologist!!! This could save you tons of money and time so you won't need to go to the ER. Stones usually take a couple days at least to pass, and it starts off not too bad, and then gets a lot worse.

\- Get the app ""My Water"", and record how much water you drink daily. Drinking enough water is not something you want to slack on because stones can form in a matter of weeks. I have a really really hard time drinking enough water, and without this app I would probably drink half of what I should.

&#x200B;

The first stone I had was the worst, because I had no idea what to do. One of the worst moments of my life... Now it's still bad, but not so bad I have to go to the hospital."
912,"Childbirth can be such a wildly different experience between different women, and different births. Some people have bad menstrual cramp contractions and the baby comes out with barely a graze. Others have days of intense back labour and get torn and cut apart.
The labour for my first was fast and intense but not kidney stone level. However, the things done to my body to get the baby out when she got her shoulders stuck... let’s just say I’ve only passed out from pain once in my life."
913,"I never passed my kidney stones because they were so large, they actually went in thru my back to take them out. They were large enough that the urologist gave me a piece to take home. But suffering trying to pass them, having a stent, and them wreaking havoc on my kidneys for three months was worse than anything I could ever imagine."
914,"To me, the level of pain was about the same, but with labor, at least you get a break in between contractions, and it ends with a sweet little baby. Kidney stones are constant pain that can last much longer with no real breaks in the pain, and of course, no baby at the end, although passing a kidney stone can feel like a huge rock moving through."
915,"The stents are 100% worse than the stone, excruciatingly uncomfortable."
916,"Towards the end I was wondering if I was gonna die though. I remember thinking how is so much pain even possible. They were so strong and so close together I could barely catch my breath and I was so exhausted I felt I was sure to just collapse and die any minute. Never passed a kidney stone but I'm having another baby soon so I couldn't tell you on the former, but the latter is happening again so we all are massochists for some babies."
917,I’d find it weird. I’d try to track down his sister and pass it on to her. I want nothing of his.
918,"Assuming there was no one else that I could pass everything on to;

My ex was a very abusive person who made over 50+ people hate me. I couldn't walk through the hallways of my college without people looking at me and whispering. If they left me everything I'd need to find a friend to go through it. Just looking at their stuff makes me feel sick.

I'd probably feel like a train hit me. I might think it was a trick or something before finally going through their stuff."
919,"It wouldn't be that particular ex. I had a partner pass away while we were in avrelationship, and he left me nothing- no reason why  he would since we hadn't reached the ""update your will to include this person"" phase.   That was fucking hard because I mourned the loss of what might have been."
920,"I recently got married, and when telling my husband’s coworker she mentioned how she never got to wear her wedding dress that she bought back in the 80’s. I was worried it was because her partner passed or left her before they married, but nope, she just bought herself her dream dress before even being in a relationship. Then she never met anyone she wanted to marry.

It’s made me curious if anyone else has done this."
921,"I did this haha when I was 19, ten years ago. My best friend and I were really into looking at dresses online after binging Say Yes To The Dress. We were both single and in an eBay phase where we just ordered stuff because we could. She found a wedding dress that she thought was perfect for me, I thought it was gorgeous, and it was only $125 so bought it because what the hell lol I thought that I’d put it away for when the time came but didn’t want to pass it up. When it arrived it was a peach instead of a champagne color and cheaper fabric than advertised - surprise. I kept it for a while and eventually ended up donating it. 

Have not bought anymore wedding dresses since 😂"
922,"I have not. But I am single and poor and I have an unusual body size/shape so every time I go to a thrift store/second hand shop I check their dress section just in case there’s a white dress that fits me and could pass as a wedding dress. I figure, since I’m there, I might as well look. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
923,"Yes! 🙌 🙌 🌈 🙏 🌹 I actually found a BEAUTIFUL dress that fit me like a glove this summer at a outside sale of a cool shop in spfd MO, just Ealing my dog passing by and ♥️ I knew I was doing a photo shoot and when I saw it,I just instantly acted (so I didn't talk myself out of it) I was like, "" is this really only $30 and when it fit like  a dream, I bought it and did a quick shoot with it (on my insta feed @practicalsaint) 

I realized then, THAT is what we really want, what I wanted anyway! Pictures of us looking beautiful! Am I correct? my other wedding dress I bought off eBay for like $10 (it was gorgeous),I had work done to it but then have it away after my divorce and move. In this day and age, it's phycho to actually get married 😅 instead of just treat ourselves like Queens ery dang day! You know 👌😍❤️❤️❤️♥️♥️I love u my sistars. Go out,get your nails done,get your hair did, get a beautiful dress and have a friend take some beautiful pics at a beautiful place, I promise a wedding doesn't sound so necessary after that lol 🙌 🏡 and yeas EVERY PERSON needs a fabulous outfit(dress) to go to the ballet in ;) ( PS I've been married twice had 3 weddings..?all of em were pretty shitty events 😭🤷⚡️⚡️xoxo kolee"
924,"My grandma passing away, it's been almost 10 years and I still think of her often."
925,Mother passing away so suddenly 10 years ago. She was ill but it wasn't due to the illness.
926,"Finding my grandpa dead. It was the day before my exams were starting. I had just sat to resume studying after my evening tea. A friend of grandfather's came home in a hurry to inform us that he was hurt. He had fainted on his way back home from the temple. Only my other grandparents were home and I had to go with my other grandfather and the friend to the place. 

My grandfather was there lying on the path to enter a restaurant. A group of people around him. He was cold. I knew the second I saw him. I knew he was gone. My mom came by then in another taxi to take him to the hospital. I remember gathering his things from the vegetable vendors there. I just stood there wondering what to do. I was not in my senses. A random passer by told me they'll drop me home. 

I was so confused I couldn't even give directions. It was a 3 minute walk. Single road. I just couldn't speak. I came home and had to manage my grandmothers who were home. I filled them in and I was told to go study. The grandma who's husband died called me from the hospital to study. She told my grandpa will want me to do well in exams. 

I somehow managed. Wrote the exam and remember breaking down after it was over. My friends didn't know what had happened. I had just asked what will happen if I don't write the exam. I cried all the way back home from college. It was a 2.5 hour journey. It was the worst time of my life. 

I couldn't mourn. I couldn't study. I was guilty of not reaching the place earlier. It was the worst period. I had a meltdown the next day when they were performing the religious rituals on thatha. I even went to the crematorium because I wanted to be with him till the end. 

I'm better now. Still can't believe I went through that. I used to not be able to walk past the restaurant for almost a year. I got over that and even recently went to eat there. I just miss my thatha so much. He was such a smart person. Loving and kind."
927,My son passing away suddenly in November.
928,"My dog dying. I knew he was going to pass within a day or two, but I was told he had about 12 hours left and I could come pick him up from the vet so he could pass away with me at our house. I was getting ready to leave, about an hour later (I was out of town heading back in when I got the call) and I got the call that he had passed away suddenly. I had already prepared for him dying, but had given myself the solace and hope of seeing him alive one last time. The fact that I wasn’t able to say goodbye was rough."
929,Oof.  My father passed away very suddenly about five months ago.  It was completely out of the blue and I’m still reeling.  Sorry this happened to you. Solidarity.
930,"Back in 2016 a cousin reached out to me on Facebook to tell me my biological dad was in a hospice and was given around 3 weeks to live. I hadn't seen him since I was 8 and thought I didn't care but it hit me like a tonne of bricks. I had so many unanswered questions that I had pushed to the back of my mind for over a decade, and I also realised there was half of me that I knew nothing about. 

I arranged to go and see him 2 days after my cousin got in contact but found out on the day that he had passed away. If I could go back to my past self I'd advise her to get in contact years earlier, not necessarily for a relationship but for some closure."
931,"I had been estranged from my father for 14 years.

His social worker called me and said he had a week to live and his dying wish was to see me. He also said a lot of other things that convinced me to see him, like telling me he was too unwell to get up etc.

I dunno. I never imagined I would say yes. But I did.

My dad had been in and out of jail, and mental institutions and halfway houses and he had been homeless. He had had violent outbursts with me. He had threatened to kill me, he violated restraining orders. I don’t know why I went. The social worker said my dad had electroshock therapy and was miraculously better.

I went. My dad sprung out of bed and hugged me and cried. He shrunk like six inches, he had lost all his teeth. It was crazy and it was too late for me to turn back.

He lived for 7 more months and I visited him once a week as I didn’t know how to say “no”

He had no friends- he had been estranged from everyone. My mom called everyone. Only one person agreed to see him. I understood, everyone had to make the right choice for themselves and I understand they were not ready to forgive him for what he did to them.

I practiced a lot of compassion. I promised myself that if there were just one insult or threat I’d leave and never go back - he never did.

It was a long strange thing. I think my story is quite unusual.

I still say - you know what is right for you. Trust yourself. However you feel is ok. You don’t owe them anything.

For me, healing my anger required compassion and I learned that closure is something you give yourself. I had already worked through what I needed to.

There is no right answer that works for everyone."
932,"I took one day at a time and chose to pray for and wish the best for them. My paternal grandfather was diagnosed with leukodysplasia about two years before he died in late December 2013. I was surprised at how quickly he passed the day he was supposed to have his first surgery/chemo (?), as he passed very quickly after receiving morphine for pain. He was also emotionally abusive when I was a kid. As such, I felt surprise when my dad called my sister to let us know our grandfather passed on  and relief that he couldn't hurt us anymore even though we'd been estranged from him for almost ten years then. That came with a touch of sadness and concern for my living paternal family, but also remembered I could not control how they handled his illness and passing, just my response to any ill-treatment, etc. I might receive.   


Taking one day at a time and not letting estranged family members, including my grandfather, use his illness to hurt me did wonders, in sum!"
933,"I'll tell you what my best friend did. Her father has been absent from her life for the most part of her life and when he was involved, it wasn't a good experience. In her late 20s, he got diagnosed with cancer with 2 years estimated time to live. She did think about what to do and decided to not let him back into her life. She felt nothing changed about their relationship because he was ill. Like that wasn't about their relationship. She felt sorry for what he did to himself, she got upset again about her childhood but it was a short-lived depression.

She still contributed to his treatment financially and when he died about 5-6 years later went to his funeral. That's all. One of her older sisters did the same. Her other older sister was far more involved. She was the one who went to the hospital and stayed with him, found people to take care of him, etc It was partially because out of the three sisters she was the only one who didn't work and had more flexible hours. It still caused a problem between the sisters but the other two told her she could choose to not do more but shouldn't expect them to support her when that meant being involved with their father. I think it's fair.

He passed over a year ago. None of the daughters regret their decision."
934,"I'm estranged from my entire family due to leaving my religion. Eventually one by one all of them will get sick and die. I will find out by a brief message, or short information only phone call. 

So far I was briefly informed that my father had cancer. 

There's nothing I can do about it so I just assign it to the general sadness that encompasses the entire situation and get on with my life. Get busy living or get busy dying."
935,"Going to sound a bit weird but a close friend who I cared for through terminal cancer passed away. Her family were useless and selfish, through out the time she was ill. After she passed and was in the funeral home her grown up son and wife went to see her and took mementos to place in her coffin. They described to me what they’d taken, there was limited restrictions as she was being buried. You would not believe the list, it was long and a lot of the stuff held little significants it genuinely felt like they were using it as an opportunity to have a clear out. I told a friend about it and then started laughing. The vision of the pall* bearers (not sure of spelling) struggle to lift her coffin and it rattling through the church was too much on top of the raw emotions and I laughed so hard I cried."
936,"32? I’m 34 now and we’ve stopped talking. 

I was going through a year of hell with my ex-MIL passing and going through housing/threat of homelessness and a break up. I got absolutely wasted at my best friends house and passed out in front of the toilet. 
A few months later, we were at another friends birthday party and we were drinking. She started telling these people we weren’t friends with, the story of how I was wasted and how she had to step over me to go to the toilet. 
My other friend and I just looked at each other like “wtf is she doing...? This isn’t cool” 
We started talking less about our lives and we would always start a convo with “Oh did I tell you?” And “no, we never talk anymore haha” 
Things came to a head a few months ago and now while we still have each other as friends on FB & Snapchat, we just don’t talk or interact at all."
937,"None, because passing laws on people's reproductive organs is messed up."
938,"It's answering the question by what isn't there as much as by what is. Women can't even imagine such a law. It's uncomfortable for us even to begin to consider it. And yet look how far men have to go before they start to get uncomfortable. I mean, they're not only comfortable with imagining such a law, they're actually writing, passing, and enforcing THOUSANDS of these laws, all around the world, and most men are completely comfortable chiming in on whether or not they think those laws go far enough in controlling women's bodies."
939,"I've been told at a couple of my jobs that I would be a good candidate for promotion/management. It wouldn't mean a substantial amount of money, usually, but a pretty good raise with that promotion and of course the potential for further promotions and raises. 

Frankly, I just don't give a shit. More money means more stress and responsibility. Plus workplace politics. I can't be bothered. I like to just come in, do my work with minimal supervision and go home. I also like being able to pass off issues to my manager when it's clearly above my responsibility. 

A lot of this is also motivated by my own mental health. I have several mental illnesses so my main goal in life is to keep myself stable enough to function properly. Sometimes going in and doing my job is difficult, I don't need the added stress of a promotion on top of that."
940,"I've recently passed on a couple of offers that paid more than I'm making now. I currently work from home and have a pretty flexible schedule, and the offers would require me to have a commute of anywhere from 30min to an hour depending on traffic. So, factoring in gas, parking permits, nice work clothes, plus the the required hours (plus the commute that could add up to 2 hours on an 8-9 hour day), we decided that my current situation was preferable."
941,"If you sleep only like 2 hours before the work day, it will pass very fast in my experience. Not too easy though. "
942,"Going through alternative school.

It was fucking horrible, every day, I had to get a fucking pat down and walk through a metal detector going in. It was humiliating, dehumanizing, and worst of all, it triggered my fucking dysphoria to the Nth degree. It wasn’t uncommon for me to break down in tears after :(. On top of that, I had a personal escort that had to take me to and from every class, and if I dared defy them, I’d go to juvenile detention center. I had to wear the uniform, which was just shorts and a polo short, which framed me so much as a boy, that I literally just gave up eventually and lied through my teeth that I was a boy, just so they would leave me the fuck alone. Oh, and the students, they were utter assholes, constantly making fun of everybody, being assholes, and outright ignoring literally everyone outside of their small ingroups: in a school of less than 300 students. The bus rides were pretty bad too, literally 40 minutes of silence both ways, and I couldn’t have even brought my phone, and I knew no one.

I was hospitalized TWICE in a crisis center, for one week each time, because of how bad it was. That’s just something I should say before I continue.

To make things worse, we weren’t allowed to have phones, or bags at the school. Which meant no opportunity to even distract myself. No bringing a skirt to school and changing into it secretly, no pulling out my phone during passing periods to remind myself that I was indeed living in the real world, not even a notebook for sketching. The only support network I actually had was the counselor (they wouldn’t let me speak to my family over a school phone), and I cried to her countless times about my dysphoria, the students being awful, and everything else.

The schoolwork wasn’t much better either. I literally learned nothing in there, the most we ever got was one worksheet, no textbooks, no resources, no presentations. The only class I ever learned anything in was math, and it was a continuation of geometry, which was decidedly my worst math subject, and kinda still is. Not to mention that they shipped over work from my main campus, but couldn’t ship any resources, or even give me recorded lectures. I was clueless on how to do Latin, to the point where I literally had no option but to use google translate: so I wasn’t even having fun learning a new language.

There was only a few saving graces:

1. I was able to at least wear panties to school, they didn’t police underwear. I was able to wear makeup too, but it didn’t change much, as I didn’t know contouring, or even how to do eyeliner back then.

2. The computers at school had YouTube unlocked, but only a weird selection of videos. There were only a handful of music videos available, and even less gameplay videos. I was able to watch like 5 osu! videos, which was a nice distraction (they were relatively recent too). But as for music, well, just about the only songs I could play from there was the nightcore remix of *Take A Hint* and *Burnt Rice*: take a guess how burned into my head the songs were… still better than silence though. (reality is lemons and the internet’s my lemonade).

3. I was somehow able to watch all of *Rick and Morty* season 1, and the first three episodes of *Gravity Falls*while in ISS. Yep, after I finished my main classes (they didn’t even send over all the work, so this wasn’t hard), I would just ask for a computer, and more often than not, I would get it. I’d sometimes get books, but I wouldn’t care. The ISS monitor definitely hated her job and wasn’t a control freak. There was literally one time where near the end of the class, I put on a video of Cookiezi playing *Revolutionary Etude* - Without headphones -, at near max volume (to be fair, it wasn’t **that** loud), and she gave zero shits as this random guy started watching too (he moved closer to me to see).

You wanna know the real kicker of this story? I was only supposed to be in there for 15 days. Literally just 15 days. I couldn’t even do that, because it was so fucking awful, and mentally damaging.

-

You might be asking, How I’ve dealt with it? Well, I’ve Repressed the shit out of the memories, that’s for sure. I’ve mostly just either gotten kinda drunk, stress eaten my hair, gone for a smoke, or just cried it all out until they go away. When something was really bad, it never truly leaves, but I certainly try my best to cope. Lately I’m hoping that I can go back to school to undo my bad high school years, and maybe get a good memory or two out of it. I can only pray…

This is one of the few things in my life that makes me cry just thinking about it. Not to mention psyche doctors were drugging me through the tail end of this shit, and started prescribing way more drugs after I had to leave the alternative school as well (I left in late October, not sure exactly how many days even passed, or what I was there).

The memories may be fuzzy at points, but they still hurt…"
943,"I battled a opioid addiction for a few years and lost everything that was important in a matter of 6 days. My job, my apartment, my car broke and then I overdosed 5 days before my 30th birthday. I went to an inpatient rehab facility for 15 months and was sober the entire time. 3 days after I took a few pills from my stepfather because we had a 3 hour drive back home and I thought it would feel good to relax. I was good for a few months after that but then started using occasional for fun. I began hanging out with a guy who I met in rehab. I actually could not stand him when I first met him. When he completed his program he ended up staying in the same area that I lived in and figured I'd reach out to him as a familiar face. To speed this up a bit we ended up becoming great friends and then fought back in forth for a few years. We also started using together and our friendship became very toxic. He ended up getting arrested in his home state with my car and was not able to come back. I what occasionally drives down to see him so that we could use. He eventually got so out of control that he was sent to another program in Florida where his mom lived. I started going to counseling in my state and was still not 100% but I wasn't doing as bad as I was prior to that. I was in Florida for vacation and was able to see him and we were both sober and it was such a great day. After that we continued to talk and be friends as we were in the beginning. About a year goes by and I know that he's using again but I didn't realize how severely he was. I was going back to Florida to see him already had my flight booked and everything and almost one month before we were leaving he ended up dying. I received a text message from his mom in the morning who I am very close to I was unable to say anything to anyone until later that day when she had more details. I spent 5 hours thinking about everything we had done over the years and wishing I could go back and change it. He was the best friend I had ever had we've been through so much together so many memories good and bad are families loved each other it was just something I never thought would happen. After he passed I decided that the drugs were not worth the pain. The pain inflicted on me on his family and friends and I would never want my friends or family to go through what I was feeling at that moment . So I vowed to get sober and live every day for him About a month later I went to see my doctor and got sober and have been sober since October 10th 2017. There was a time that I wasn't sure if I would ever get sober but losing him was the wake-up call I needed. I would give anything to have him back but I think that him knowing that I am okay now made it worth it. So I guess getting sober and good morning my best friend was the hardest thing I ever had to go through."
944,"I have seen some posts like this, and I for sure don't agree. In a lot of ways my self identity definitely solidified around the age of 24-26. But in no way do I have everything sorted out, whatever that even means!

I'm nearly 27 and a broke uni student, only in my 3rd year of a 6 year degree because I started late, because my shit was hella not together after high school and after moving out. I wouldn't change anything! I'm lucky to have had the privilege to take my time and make lots of mistakes and lots of good memories too. And there'll be plenty more! I'd bet my life on it!
That's what life is, it's not perfect.

Nothing is permanent, and hopefully that comforts you! If you're struggling or in a period of uncertainty now, that won't last and that will pass! It also means everyone that claims their shit is well together, it won't be forever! Change is inevitable and imo if you embrace that you'll be much happier in life."
945,"I'm in my 30s and the only thing I can say about passing 25 is it's the point where people kinda settle into who they are. Like who I was inside at 20 vs 25 is a huge difference but who I was at 30 vs 25 isn't, or even 25 vs 35 is still pretty much the same. There's some outside difference like I've figured out what kind of job I want and I'm more financially comfortable, but the kind of person I am has settled down.

So from that point of view, generally speaking, 25 is a big milestone, but in a good way. I love being in my 30s"
946,"To me, it's not a landmark set in stone, but it does seem like, in their mid-20s, people should be midway between their teens and young adult years, and the point where they at least begin to consider getting their shit together. Knowing themselves as people, building a life that they like, starting to question the baggage they were brought up with and starting to work towards overcoming it if need be, finding at least some passions and abilities that might point them in the direction of a career. Of course, all of these things should be life-long pursuits, and it's never too late for most of them, and of course the age of 25 is completely arbitrary and should never be seen as a ""best before"" expiration date. But it does kinda feel to me like it's around this point in someone's life that they should get their shit together and start becoming the person they want to be.

Which is, on the other hand, why (again, to me personally) it seems too young for marriage and kids, house and car (in cases where it's not necessary). But to each their own, of course.

Edit: the nice thing you'll notice is, the older you get, the less you give a shit about what others think about what your life should look like. I'm 34 now, and I'm the happiest I've ever been, best skin ever, the same weight I had at 18 but much better self-care and beauty knowledge, the most amazing sex life, no kids (people are finally believing me I don't want any), and a complete and utter lack of shits given as far as to what others think my life should look like."
947,"> .idk it seems arbitrary? I mean, is 25 generally considered “older”?

I don't take it literally and focus on what they're actually trying to say without the specific number 25.

Usually when I see it mentioned, they're referring to someone (for example) on /r/relationships who is 19 and engaged to be married and both living at home with parents.

I have no room to talk being that I met my SO when I was 21 and we've now been together 8.5 years.. BUT generally speaking, the person you're with at a young age has a higher likelihood of not being the person you're with long term. So people like to say to wait until at least 25 to get married -- not so much because it definitely *won't* work at a younger age, but because it lessens your chances if you wait.

> “too old” for a lot of things (like dressing a certain way, or feeling unsure in life, which someone who is only a couple of years younger gets a free pass for). I’ve even seen people here say that once you’re 25, you’re not “young” anymore (this is also implied when I see posts targeted towards “older women”, 25 is always the cutoff age)

Kinda same as above - I think it is more a general ""range"" than a hard set thing.

25 is still young enough to get away with a lot clothing wise - almost anything. But I do personally abide by the sentiment that certain clothing more difficult to get away with as we age. You can certainly wear a Tweety Bird tiedye shirt to a job interview if you so choose, but you are putting yourself at a disadvantage by doing so. Same for anything sexy/revealing.. or a full goth getup. Basically - you do you, but we live in a society. You will be perceived accordingly.

Same goes for direction in life. As someone who is still friends with a LOT of people in their 30s that are bartenders and will likely be bartenders as long as they can, I certainly don't think there's anything wrong with not having shit ""figured out"".

But as you start to get up in your later 20s, you are generally expected to be able to take care of yourself and pull your weight in (for example) a romantic relationship. Or even a friendship. Relationships of any kind require both parties to provide partnership to a certain extent. When we are young, not so much the case. But I mean yeah if you can't pay for your half of dinner when you are out with friends, they will likely see something wrong with that.

The friends I mention above have literally not even $100 saved in a bank account, have no health insurance, etc. They aren't ""in the wrong"", but there's no denying they'd be royally screwed if something happened to them. And as they get older, the chances of that happening will continue to increase."

I also make a point to look to the side once in awhile for a second because while I hate the length of my drive, I pass some very beautiful landscape. I live on the gulf and drive along bays and along bluffs overlooking the water for the first 15-20 minutes of my drive, 20-30 minutes of it if I take the 'long' way that goes further down the bluffs. 

I found that once I made an effort to take in those sights more, I was a lot happier about the commute. "
957,about 50 minutes each way. I pass the time by getting mad at my satellite radio for playing weird songs on the Broadway station. RENT in Japanese?

The most annoying part of my job is at the end of the semester, when I’m filling out my failure reports, I have to go through so many steps and provide multiple documentations of intervention to show that the student didn’t do the work to pass. More often than I’d like, I’m contacted by admin or guidance to let a kid pass despite the failure, and sometimes I’m overruled!!!! The kid passes the course anyways!!! It makes me livid.

I want all my kids to pass, I don’t want failure for them, and I work hard so they have a good chance. But when a kid shows up 20 times and completes a quarter of the assignments they can’t  pass because they can’t get credit for things they didn’t do. What message does that send?"
962,"For a long time I used to take off work for my mums anniversary. Would take it as a me day, I'd get her flowers and just take time to remember. 
I don't do it anymore. It's been over 20 years now and I've just passed the age where I have outlived her."
963,"We remember them fondly on their birthdays. Sometimes we'll make a cake or do something that they enjoyed. For my brother who died when he was 7, on the anniversary of his passing and his birthday we eat chicken nuggets. My older brother died recently and his birthday is in a couple of weeks. I still can't believe he's gone some days, so I don't know what I'll do this year for him :/"
964,"My husbands tribal practice is for the women to cut off their hair to at least their shoulders. They leave the hair with the casket as a show of mourning. It’s said the more you cut off the more you mourn. You’re not supposed to cut it off unless someone has died, or for up to a year after the loved one has passed away. Including styling, straightening, curling, or dyeing.

Edit: His tribes women practice it. Since I am married in I have the option to practice it or not and I won’t be looked down for not practicing it since I am non tribal. But I plan to."
965,"Not necessarily what you asked for but this is a “ritual” that involves loved ones who have passed away.

My family has this thing that whenever we accidentally drop keys, we think of someone who has passed away.

It started 30 years ago when a neighbor passed away after a decade-long battle with breast cancer. It was a few months after her funeral and my father dropped his keys on the way to open our front door. When he picked them up, he found himself looking right at her house and thinking of her. 

We’ve all taken up this “ritual”. I often think of my grandma or father-in-law."
966,After my uncle (who was like a father to me) passed away I made sure I prayed every night before bed just to give thanks. I’ve done it for the last 5 years no matter where I am  or what time I went to sleep. I recently stopped doing this after going through a rough break up and it was horrible. I didn’t realize how much I missed doing that/saying thank you so after 2 months I started again and honestly it’s been really nice and I am going to do everything to not stop again.
967,"I'd strongly consider breaking up. I'm already poly. I don't want a ""hall pass"" to be in relationships with other people. The limited contact bit would be an absolute killer though. If you don't want to interact with me then why are we even in a relationship?"
968,"Possibly reassess my relationship. I don't want to be with someone who thinks ""hall passes"" are an okay idea.

>what if this hall pass was in response to you needing some space.

Reassess my realtionship because he seems to think ""needing space"" means ""needing another dick/pussy"" rather than ""needing to process legitimate issues in my life & relationship."""
969,"Did they give you the 'hallpass' exclusively, or are they taking one too?

Either way, if I'm at the point where I told my SO that I needed a month's worth of space, even if I weren't intending on sleeping with anyone else, that's time to end things. It's not fair for either of us to be in a relationship where we're not happy."
970,"My mom died of sepsis as a result of an infection that she got in the first place because of MS, not cancer. I'm answering because I think it's somewhat similar in that we knew she was dying for a long time (before the sepsis, we were told her liver was failing) so it wasn't a shock. If this comment is too deraily and needs to be pulled, I totally understand.

Ask her so many questions: about high school, about her life before kids, about hopes and dreams and victories, about romance and summer jobs. Ask about what it was like when she was pregnant with you, maybe what was going on in her head. Ask about any stories from your childhood that she remembers strongly, or that she wants to tell you. Ask what she thought of the world before you and what she thinks of it now. Ask what she hopes for the world, and what she hopes for you. Write this stuff down, or maybe even record it.

When I was sitting by her hospital bed, I didn't ask these questions because there was always some other family member nearby and I felt weird about it. I really regret not taking the time to find out more about the person my mother was and what she hoped for. (She died when I was still a teenager so our relationship hadn't yet grown into that adult-to-adult thing that a lot of people have.) Without getting too schmaltzy, I really wish I knew how she'd feel about me and the world around me now."
971,"So I (20F) just had a mom who died of breast cancer 4 months ago. She was smart about it  she made all the arrangements beforehand, put all her passwords and accounts all in one excel file and gave them to me. It's really helped now that I'm organizing the family finances and managing all her accounts, or getting rid of them. 

Talk about how she wants to die, at home or in a hospital/hospice center. Whether or not she wants a funeral. Does she have belongings she wants sent to people. Does she have an up to date will? 

Bank accounts are huge, are they a joint with her husband if so that has to get sorted. God we didn't know what an ordeal that would be. 

Know when to call hospice. Don't be brave and say you can take care of her yourself. I did this for a few months while she was bedridden and it was horrible. I'm glad I got to be there for her. But having a medical professional checking in and visiting your home takes away SO much stress. 

As for the emotion of things. Make a TON of jokes. As horrible as it sounds, taking it seriously at all times can be catastrophic to everyone involved. Seriously humour with my brother and father was HUGELY beneficial to our coping process. 

Try not to dread the after too much. You oddly feel a sense of relief when she passes, the bad is behind you and you'll have already seen and hit rock bottom. I didn't even realize I had. I was already on the upswing the day after she died, horrible as it sounds. 

Spend as much time with her as possible, remember why mothers and daughters are best friends. My mom was mine and I'm glad I stuck by her side through it all, no matter how painful it was."
972,"Make new memories. For me,  I cherish those memories more than anything else. 

We did stuff together, we watched old movies,  as well as Jeopardy. I still remember the last final jeopardy question we watched.. We took drives and made crafts. 

For those few months we were friends,  not mother and daughter facing the final passing"
973,"When my dad was dying from lung cancer we sat down and made a bucket list, we assumed we had about a year before he passed and we wanted to knock off as much as possible. He unfortunately had a terrible reaction to the chemotherapy and he was too sick to do much of anything within 2 weeks of treatment and passed away about 3 months after the diagnosis.

I was so angry that instead of 12 months we only got 3 and we didn’t get to do anything on that list.

Be prepared to not be able to do the fun things anymore. Sometimes it can be too difficult for them to even get out of bed much less go on a walk, so if there’s something she loves try to bring it to her. 

Spend as much time as you can, you never know when the meds or cancer starts to eat away at her mental abilities. Watching my dad go from the smartest person in any room to repeatedly asking the same question over and over again was heart breaking.

I’m glad I got to be there for his last months. And as hard as it was watching him die I don’t remember him as the shell of himself he was when he was in a coma for the last couple days of his life. I have many good memories and honestly I think it made him happy talking about the good times we had as a family.

Nothing is going to prepare you for everything that could happen, but just roll with the punches and be present. 

Make sure all her legal stuff is in order too- wills, memberships that need to be canceled, etc. it’s been 9 years and we’re dealing with having to get a death certificate to sell a car that was on my dad’s name when he passed. 

There’s going to be puke, blood, soiled bedsheets, confusion and a lot of tears.

Find a good therapist, I waited until about 5 years after he passed to start seeing one. I wish I would have much earlier.

Best of luck. I hope ask her wishes are fulfilled.

If you have any questions or just want an ear to bend/ commiserate with feel free to PM me. It’s a shitty journey but I’m glad you said you have a good support system, that’s with its weight in gold."
974,"My mother passed October 2016 from endometrial cancer.  Just remember to take care of you and see a therapist.  My mother's passing sent me into such a depression because the worst that could happen, did.  I'm the oldest child and my Dad was beside himself.  So just remember that it's ok to cry-dont try to be 'strong' by not crying and cramming it down.

1. Make sure to have all the plans in place for funeral, so you don't have to make any decisions later.  
2. Be sure that there is enough space in her bedroom for the hospital bed when hospice comes.
3. It's gonna suck hard.
4. Find where her sentimental/expensive jewelry is.  I remember Dad and my sister couldn't find her heirlooms for us to inherit.  Then, when they were cleaning out the closet, it was in a plain box at the bottom of the closet, and not in her jewelry box 
5. Are there people who want to say a few words to her before she passes?  Be sure to also say your goodbyes.  I did it when Mom went into a coma, a few days before she died.
6. Be prepared when she does go into the coma (if she does, her jaw muscles will go slack and it bothered me more than it should have).
7. I administered her morphine when she was home, and I kept a log of how much and what time i administered it. 8. I do remember a friend was retired policeman and he had to do something special with the remaining morphine.

I can't really think of anything else, but please feel free to ask questions.  I hope this helps some.

Lots of hugs"
975,"My mom died of cancer in August 2016 and not a day pass of me without thinking of her.
Tell her how much you love her,  spend as much time with her. What i regret the most is that I dont have videos of her. I miss her voice and sometimes i forget how she sounded like."
976,"My mom passed away from cancer 5 years ago this April and my only wish is that I took more videos and photos of her.

I was living with her at the time and did everything with her but i still wish I had something tangible to look at :( memories are there but they aren't really enough sometimes.

One thing I did for my mom was contacting her old friends. They came to visit her and that made her very happy. 

This might sound weird but ask her to write you a memory note, and save it. Last May I accidentally found a note my mom left me ( I knew she wrote toward the end because of the bad hand writting) That note made me start living again and got me out of a very bad relationship I was in. It's like she was there for me at a time I really really needed my mother with me.

Also take some time off if you can afford it and just be with her. Get to know some of her routines,  it will help you later on to do the things she did. I bake and cook a lot because that's what I got from her and it makes me happy to do what she used to do. It makes me feel like I still have something of hers.

My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family..."
977,"Follow your mom's wishes. Write down her favorite things, record her voice, pictures for everything!
My mom passed away suddenly and i have very few of these things.
Please tell your mom everything and anything! Don't let her pass away with you having regrets! You need peace while she finds her peace!"
978,Be with her and stroke her hair while she is in bed.
979,"Ask her questions. Many, many questions about her life. Hold her hand as she answers and embrace her when talking about tough times. Feel her heartbeat and feel her face. Use your fingers to memorize curve of her nose, the touch of her cheeks and the smooth sensation of her eyelids. It will not be creepy, trust me.

Hold her hands, smell her scent and be happy that she's still here. Bask in her presence, and remember that feeling. Let her know that you love her, that you've always loved her and shower her with adoration, as when she passes, she knows that her baby loves her. 

Acknowledge everything that you can remember, and don't bring up any regrets. Love her as much as you can, as much as you can muster. Spend as much time as you can with her. Remind her of the happy moments in life."
980,"My dad died of cancer over the summer. A few things beyond what others have mentioned: my dad got very frail and weak, and it was difficult to see him declining in that way. His breath smelled absolutely horrific and it was really hard to physically be near him (of course I sucked it up because I knew time was limited and it was, at least I think, the cancer that made him stinky. Not much to do about that). Be prepared to process what you’re seeing in addition to what is going to happen. 

After he passed, those first few days were an absolute mist of things to do, shit to process, and FEELINGS. I was personally in no condition to make decisions, so I might recommend having someone in your support network help you. For example, while I took that first week off of work, I kept responding to emails and even accepted a project that needed to be completed that week. Looking back I could have used someone to gently close my laptop for me. 

One last thing to think about is your mom’s final wishes. My dad had a will, but it was shockingly light on details about what he wanted after he died. My mom and I thought it was all laid out, but it really wasn’t. The night he passed (he was at home), people were asking questions like “what mortuary do you want us to call?” And we were like.... uh no clue. Should we check yelp for recommendations? The hospice nurse did help us figure that out, but again- we were in that mist of grief/confusion. Having a clearer plan would have been helpful in those first moments. 

Feel free to dm me any time. It’s a lot and a horrible burden to bear, even with a good support network."
981,"My stepmom’s fight lasted five long, beautiful, and horrific years. When I suspected something went wrong, her daughter knew immediately, what started out as breast cancer that had already spread to bones and her kidneys, was now in her brain. 

She passed 11 days after the diagnosis. I think for yourself, the best that you can do is to have a quiet moment with her if possible. Say the things you always wanted to. 

I never got to properly say goodbye, she was already in a coma by the time I got to see her in hospital. I didn’t have the proper supports, and I myself have an illness. It just triggered flares for me. I was so busy trying to make sure my father was eating and sleeping. 

Be prepared because family will fall out. My stepsister only had her grandma here in the country after her mom passed and my father was too much of a wreck to try and keep up with her, or even try and heal together because they’d both been caring for her so long. He lost touch with her and after a year of pushing, my sister and I finally got to reconnect with her. It’s such a sore subject now that he and I don’t speak. Be prepared because my stepmom was definitely the glue that held our family together. She was the absolute love of his life, a joy to have around, she’d light up every room and make you feel part of the family. 

Try to get the legal stuff done as soon as possible so you can cherish the last moments you have. And make sure there are as many moments as possible. Prepare yourself for seeing her in a vulnerable way, because parents don’t always like to be seen as such. There is also something truly heartbreaking about having a nurse flush fluids out of their lungs knowing it’s just going to fill up again while you’re waiting for them to leave you."
982,"Take. Pictures. With. Her. My mom just passed due to a hysterectomy gone wrong because of cancer. I had maybe three pictures with her before any of this. Be patient with her and if there’s a chance she can recover be patient within her recovery. And most of all, take your time processing."
983,"Right now you don’t know how long she’ll still be here, and how she’ll feel. So what you should do is what feels right for you to do. This stuff is hard, no one prepares you for this and I guess no one can. It’s okay to call in sick to be with your mom, and it’s also okay to need time for yourself. Don’t feel guilty about what you are doing or feeling cause you are doing the best you can in a very, very difficult situations. 

My father was sick for 1,5 years before passing away. We just wanted to do fun stuff together, stuff we’d normally do as well. Like getting ice cream, going to the movies or going to the same old vacation spot we’ve always been to. Looking back I’m glad we got to do all of it. 

After he passed, we had pillows made from his clothes. Just an idea what you could do, for me it’s comforting to hug my pillow when I think about him and am sad."
984,"My mom passed away from non-Hodgkins lymphoma when I was a freshman in college. I miss her every day. I wish I would have spent more time with her and gotten to know her, as a person. I wish I could have hugged her held her more. I wish we had more outings and mom and me moments. Gone to dinner, mall, walks and trips. I was young and I just didn’t know. My mom must have been so overwhelmed (we were 14 siblings). My biggest regret is not getting to know her and telling her how much I loved and appreciated everything she did for me, us. She was the world and was the glue that held us all together. Our family has been broken ever since. I’m sorry that you are going through this. It’s not easy but hold her , love her, smell her. You will miss all of that."
985,"One thing I did when my dad had liver cancer  was do what he wanted, in terms of food, desitions , etc ,if he wanted to have pizza for dinner we did it instead of pushing a healthy diet on him.. things I wish I did , have him tell me stories about his life which were super interesting, I do know a few but I can't remember them all and I wish I had him to tell me one more time, also ask him what should I do in different cases so when he was no longer there I would have an answer from him so I'd have at least an idea of what to do instead of feeling hopelessly lost like where to take the car for service what to do when it's too old etc simple stuff that I had problem resolving and felt like trapped inside a hole .. also ask him about important papers like when my dad passed we didn't know where the ownership papers of the house were etc"
986,"My grandmother was much closer to me than my mom, and she died of pancreatic cancer when I was twelve. 

-She may deteriorate fast. Much faster than the doctors predict.

-Hearing is the last sense to go.

-Don't feel bad if her passing gives you a feeling you weren't expecting. I felt relief when my grandma died because for the six weeks leading up to her death, the house was pure chaos.

-There's no point in beating yourself up from regret. Try not to think, ""I could've done/said this!"" 

-It's far better to pass in a home than in a hospital. 

-Grief is weird. I didn't experience grief until a few years until my grandma died."
987,"We watched chick flicks like Dirty Dancing and laughed as we said the lines.  I was there from dx to her dying in my arms.   The biggest regret I have is not having recorded her voice.  It was 15 years ago but it seems like yesterday.   It is the worst pain and suffering both of us have ever endured.  She is at peace but the grief is unending and randomly triggered.   Make sure hospice comes to help you and her, and get the counseling from them once she passes.  You will need it the first year for sure.   Also, don’t make big decisions/changes the first year, too.  Grief makes for irrational decisions.   Bless you and your mom."
988,"For all those that say record your voice. Do it. I have 6 voicemails from my mom who passed from a long battle of cancer last September. It was very sudden to us, because she had been fighting it for so many years and then within days things did a 360.  Have her write you something that you can read and cherish.  For us, it really helped to know that she was no longer in pain. She had been in so much pain for so long, she could finally rest.  It never stops hurting, but it gets easier to cope. Even though it hurts, I listen to her voicemails to remind me, because I don’t want to forget her voice. That helps."
989,"Dealing with the situation right now (Mom undergoing chemo; and dad miraculously emerged from 4th cancer last year) so while I ain’t a women, I guess I am eligible to respond.
1st thing 1st, SHE IS NOT DYING COZ YOU ARE NOT GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN. She is just ailing and you and your family shall emerge victorious. Relax, clear your head and pull-up your Socks. 
Disbelief> Regret> Fear> Denial> Hope; I think these are the 5 stages of emotional journey for a cancer patient plus the pain, side effects of therapy, weight loss, appetite loss, etc. 
1. So the first thing is to be aware and alert towards what your mom is going through and accordingly respond with palliative care. This includes emotional and physical care.
2. Cancer is malignant, it spreads and in advanced stages can cause organ failures or sudden complications. Have an emergency plan of action ready. Ask your doctor what are emergency possibilities and be ready what will you do in case.
3. It’s an expensive disease, be ready with back-up finances 
4. Most important: you cannot have another patient to attend to right now. So everyone else in the family must take better than usual care of themselves
5. If you can, employ atleast a 12-hr paramedic at home. Depending upon type and stage, Cancer patients face delirium, need help with moving, washing and cleaning, etc. It is quite a toll on the primary caregiver. Have someone to share the load at night so the primary caregiver stays well. Shall also help your mom maintain her hygiene, make-up (y she looked beautiful all her life, y not now?), etc
6. Help her attend to her unfinished work, last wishes, etc
7. Spend sometime with her each day and talk to her the good times she had in her life. So when the soul passes away, it remembers this life fondly. Smile often. 
8. Meditate. You are old enough. You have all the answers. Close your eyes and clear your mind. You can do this. You can help her fight it out or move to next level with peace. 
All the best. May God we with you all"
990,"I didn't lose my mum to cancer, but a car accident. I was 13, so will give you the things I wish I had from her.
Get her to write a letter to you, and if you have children, to them too. Maybe even a letter to your future children if you don't have any yet.
Like so many others have said, record her voice, whether by audio clio or video. I can't remember my mum's voice and I hate it. 
Get lots of pictures of her. Even if she's poorly. Pictures of my mum are few and far in between as she always took them. Pictures with the two of you as well, even if it's selfies. 
Any special recipes she had or meals she liked to cook, get her to write it down for you. 
Make sure you get any special jewellery or clothes of hers once the time comes. Because of how my mum passed and how young I was I was never consulted, and I'm sure the jewlery she always wore which was a part of her identity were thrown away with her clothes or something, as I was never able to find it, and I'm still devastated about it 15 years later."
991,"My grandmother died from bone cancer years ago. I was very fond of her and I consider her as my second mom. Since she was living with us when we were young, I got to spend a lot of time with her. I always tease her when she eats because when she chews her food, it's as if she has no teeth at all. 

One of my fondest memories of her was during my birthday celebrations with her. She always cooks me spaghetti, chicken lollipops and my favorite dessert, leche flan.

That's why it broke my heart when she passed away days away from my birthday.

I just wished that I had more time to tell her how she means to me. I wish I've spent more time with her. I also wish I got to take more pictures with her but, unfortunately, during that time we didn't have our smartphones yet.

I still regret not being there when she took her last breath. But I do hope she still watches over me.

I miss you so much. How I wish you're still here by my side especially now that I'm very much struggling with life. I will always love you. And see you there soon!"
992,"Create more happy memories with her, take heaps of pictures!! try and do things that she has on hers and also your bucket list so that you know that when she passes she died happy and knowing how much she loved you! I’m so sorry you’re going through this :("
993,"Collect her writing. After I lost my mom at 24 I found that her handwriting was such an intimate way to connect to her as this was the early 2000’s before people videoed a lot on phones and cameras. Any of her recipes that you loved, favourite perfumes (I used to spray it on her favourite sweaters when I missed her after she passed). Please hold her hand and stroke her face even though she looks fragile. I remember mom crying one day because she felt like no one wanted to touch her but it was because she was in so much pain and I didn’t want to cause her more by holding her or touching her. Know that you will be exhausted, that you can’t be there every second for her. Your heart is breaking, you’re under extreme stress and you’re grieving. Learn to forgive yourself for the moments you felt like you should’ve been there but weren’t. And most of all, let her know it’s ok to go when she’s ready. So often we put this pressure on people to stay because we need them and love them. But letting them know that it’s ok, that you understand they can’t fight any longer and that they aren’t giving up just moving on can be a HUGE sense of peace for everyone. 
Death is not the about the person who dies but about those who are left behind to grieve. 
My thoughts and heart go out to you in this terrible time. May you both feel gratitude and love in the final chapters."
994,"My dad passed 8 years ago unexpectedly after a super short battle with cancer and I am upset with myself every day for not asking him more about the bands he was in in highschool and the dreams he had growing up. I wish he had told me more stories... his laugh and voice had faded in my memory. I only have 2 short videos from when he was here and I regret everyday that I didn’t take more. I regret that he always took the photos and was rarely in them... just enjoy the time you have with her and ask her questions. Ask her about when she grew up, about her childhood friends.... anything you’ve ever wanted to know about her or even yourself, ask."
995,"I’m not a woman but seeing this post made me think about old times and memories with my mom who died of cancer when I was 18.




We were never really a close family, we didn’t have “real” conversations with each other but we had “cold” love. I really loved my mom so much more than my father. 


When my mom got sick I had to constantly clean our apartment because my father was working and basically had very low need of hygiene around our home. I also had to learn to cook myself food and do shopping and budget the money we had, my mom used to do this. It was a bit too much for a 18 yo at first but I managed pretty well. We knew it was terminal but she didn’t know. She was hoping and praying every day so she gets healthy again. Unfortunately at the time I was very closed emotionally therefore eventually taking care of shit started to feel like chores and got me annoyed. I did them regardless but it was a topic for many fights with my father and I knew those fights were not a good effect on my mom’s health.


Later on she got into hospice. They said she has around a week or so. She held on for so long, she was there for a month in the end. The hospice was in another city so it was quite hard but we managed to visit her every day. She always asked when is she coming home and it broke my fucking heart. She was so high on morphines and she was in ton of pain. I told her “soon”. I lied to her on her death bed. So, don’t lie to your dying mother even if it is for comfort. It haunts me to this day and I’m 26 now. In her last few days she was so high on morphine we couldn’t even talk with her we just sit there and took care of her, etc. One day I thought to myself “fuck this that really isn’t my mom there anymore it’s just her body her soul is gone”. I didn’t go that day. She passed away that night. Sometimes I think to myself she felt like she was a burden to me and she just let herself go so she doesn’t bother me anymore. I wish I could go back in time and spend the last few days with her. I also don’t have any photos of her but I still remember her face and laugh and that’s something I’m gonna hold on for forever.


I shouldn’t have wrote this at work I’m about to fucking cry"
996,"My mom passed away from breast cancer when I was 16. We knew it was coming, but none of us had ever dealt with something like this, and now we have a lot of regrets. 

If she's able, have her write you a letter. Going through old birthday cards and old text messages still mean a lot, but I don't have much written that has any substance. It would have been nice if we had thought to have her write letters for future events with advice, but now we have to rely solely on memory. 

My grandparents had her house cleared out and on the market within a week after she was gone. They didn't give any of us much time to go through her things before they donated it all. Everyone grieves differently and I'm not mad at them, but there are a few things that I wish we had held onto. If you're not sure, but it's too painful to look at, put things in storage until you're ready. Even now, 7 years later, I'll be getting ready to go somewhere and wish I had one of her jackets or scarves that I could wear. 

Have her draft a will ASAP. Death can bring out the worst in people and the last thing you will want to do is fight with relatives over money / material possessions.  No one thinks that their family is capable of that, but I've seen it happen time and time again. 

If she's still healthy, I would recommend taking as many photos of you two together and try going on a short trip. Once my mom got too sick, we stopped taking photos because she refused to be remembered like that. I wish I had snapped a few more before it got to that point. 

I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot, but my inbox is open if you want to talk. Praying for you, friend."
997,"My little sister's mom passed away from cancer almost 4 years ago. They spent a lot of time together, but, I love the voice idea. I dont know if she did that, I hope she did"
998,"My mother passed away from brain cancer 3 years ago. Reading these comments, I feel like my story needs to be said because it's different from most here.

She was a flawed person and my mom and I never had a really good relationship. That doesn't mean that I didn't love her, I just couldn't get along with her. Taking care of someone you don't get along with was really tough- so be kind to yourself and give yourself time too as a caretaker.

I asked her to do many of the things people suggested here but she said no to all of them. She couldn't write because the cancer made her disabled in the right side of her body (she was right handed). She didn't want to be video recorded because she looked ""ugly and fat."" She didn't want to draw or do anything. She just wanted to cry and watch violent crime dramas. I sat and watched more crime dramas in a lifetime in those 2.5 years. But I'd like to think it gave her some happiness just sitting there with her.

Sometimes, it felt very lonely and isolating. Like this was all happening on an island and my friends and support system were too far from it...I was too far from them and they forgot about me. They didn't call to ask how I was doing, some pretended my mom didn't have cancer, others acted like I too had cancer and stayed away the same. When I asked my best friend why she never asked if I was ok she said she wasn't sure it was appropriate to ask knowing I had so much going on. Tell people to ask you what you want. Tell them to show up, tell them to not assume you don't or do want to talk about it. People don't know how to deal with grief, it's not their fault, but ask for the support you need. And you will need it.

People will disappoint you, a lot. Your family, your mom's spouse, your friends. But there will also be people who show up in ways you never expected. Hold onto those people and cherish them. Going through this really helps you to understand those who can show up in tough situations. My husband was my rock and continues to be. He showed up in ways I never expected but it really solidified that even if I was a failure in life, at least I married the right person."
999,"Spend a lot of time with her. Take pictures of you two together. Make her record a message for you that you can listen to when the time comes and can make you feel at ease a bit, or even just to remember her voice. Keep something from her with you and spray it with her signature perfume. Ask her whatever you want to know the answer to. Collect stuff with her handwriting on it. 

My mom died 8 years ago when I was 12, I don’t have any recordings and almost no pictures of us together. I didn’t spend a lot of time with her because of school and because I wanted to hang out with friends. I regret that so much cause I can’t get those moments back. I’m starting to forget what her voice sounds like, I’m starting to forget how she smelled, I’m starting to forget a lot of things and that kills me sometimes. 

Say goodbye to her while she can still understand, tell her everything you want to tell her. Tell her how much you love her, how much she means to you. It’s not a definite goodbye yet, but that way you won’t regret not telling her after it’s too late. I didn’t do it and that’s my biggest regret ever. 

It’s going to be rough in the beginning. For me it felt like she was away on vacation and she could walk through the front door any second. And then it hit me, that’s not going to happen. She won’t be here for so many things that are going to happen in my life that she should be here for. When that happened I crashed. It took me a couple of months to deal with it, but now I’m at peace with it. I know now that she’s relieved of all the pain and misery she went through and even though she’s not with me physically, I know she’s watching over me and of course she always continues to live on inside my heart. Just know that she’ll always be there, no matter how much time has passed. 

I’m happy to hear you have family and friends to support you. Take your time to grieve, alone or together with them. Keep strong."
1000,"Just listen to her and respect her wishes.  Spend time with her, tell her anything you want her to know.  When my parents passed, I had no unfinished business, nothing left unsaid.  Give yourself that peace."
1001,"When my mom was going through it I was in my senior year of high school and transitioning into college. I really regret not spending more time with her or being more proactive with texting her, visiting her, and so on. I think I didn’t actually believe she would die. 

If I were back in that position, I would definitely try to make her life as easy as possible. I would talk with her, cook with her, and treasure that time better. I also wish I took more videos and pictures together because my memory is bad and I can’t remember what she sounds like without hearing a recording. 

I think you should know that it really hurts and is a struggle after she passes, but it does get easier over time. Although unless I’m emotionally prepared to talk or think about her, I will get pretty emotional."
1002,"I was 11 when my mom passed & 29 when my dad followed. I miss the conversations & laughter terribly. Take the time to ask everything you’ve ever been curious about & inquire about family history. So much information passes with them & there’s not always a way to fill in the blanks. Take pictures! I have a handful of old rolls of film that I’ve been slowly developing & I always hope there’s a new/old pic of my dad that I get to rediscover. 

I know someone said record conversations & that’s great to have. I had a few voicemails that I’d listen to when I needed to hear my dads voice. But one day technology failed me & they were wiped from the saved system. Cherish those & make a back up of the back up if you always want to hear her voice. I didn’t, but I took it as my dad telling me that it was time to let go of that part of him. I still hear his voice clearly in my mind either way. 

Mostly, just make everyday count. <3"
1003,"Spend as much time with her as possible. Always greet her with a kiss and say goodbye whenever you leave, just in case. Tell her right now what a wonderful mother she was. Never think you’ll say it another time. Ask for her last bit of advice. Talk about your favorite family memories. And write down as many recipes as she can remember. Ask her right now what she wants after she dies. If she’s cremated does she want to be scattered, and where? What kind of funeral does she want? Do it now while she can still make these choices. It’ll be hard, and awkward, but do it. Ask her what she thinks the afterlife will be like. The vision of it in your head will probably change as she approaches death and after she passes. I’m not sure where you all are in the process, but talk about hospice and caregivers. If you can, I’d recommend having someone stay overnight. We weren’t able to do that, and I think it has some trade offs, but I think it might be worth it. Remember it’s your job to be a daughter, and I hope you don’t have to take on the role of a nurse or anything. Get to know the people who work for hospice. Ask them questions. Consider joining support groups. Tell your friends what’s going on, and be prepared to let some people go. Most people won’t know what to say or do. Some people will be terrible friends. A few people will grow very close to you. Take care of yourself. Do whatever you need to get out of bed every day and do something. It’s okay if you feel numb for a long time too. Read some books about it. I liked “what to do when I’m gone” as well as “the Tibetan book of living and dying.” I know nothing is okay right now, but it will pass."
1004,"The things that have been a blessing to me from my time with Mama before she passed... 

I had time to really get to know her as a person.  We would talk to the wee hours of the morning and she told me story after story from her life.


I recorded videos of her singing our favorite nursery rhymes that I watch all the time. They are very comforting.. especially if I am sick or had a bad day.


Pictures.  Lots of pictures.  Even ones that you don't think you would like to have later.  Things look different once everything is done.

She taught me to cook her signature dishes her way over an intercom.  I am now often called on by my siblings to make 'Mama's Pot Roast'.

Some of my most pleasant memories of her final months (besides talking) were clipping coupons together on Sundays, using a video chat to 'take' her outside to check on her flower beds and look around, and watching her favorite shows with her.

Be prepared for some bad times, too.  There were a couple of times I had to step away because Mama became so mean and resentful to me (very out of character).  She also didn't like me to leave her side and it would get claustrophobic sometimes.  There was also a brief period where she didn't know who I was and would scream and throw things at me... fortunately she came back to normal.

Smell her.  Feel her skin.  Hug her and really be present."
1005,"My dad died of cancer when I was younger... I think it's most important to tell her everything you need to. My biggest regret with my dad was that i was so young, (13), I didn't think he would actually pass away even when he was in hospice, so I always assumed we had more time when we didn't. I wonder if my dad knew how much I loved him, because I was too scared and in denial to say it."
1006,"My Mom passed away due to metastatic breast cancer when I was 9 and my brother was 7.. my Mom was 28.. she knew she was terminally Ill for about 3 months before she passed.. my brother and I were never told until that awful day came.. my Dad tried to encourage her to write letters for us to read as we got older, but unfortunately she couldn't accept that she was dying and never did it.. I wish with all my heart that she could have brought herself to do it, but I understand that she was not able to.. my heart breaks when I think about how she must have been feeling, both physically and mentally, during that time.. I do remember her voice saying certain things, and I remember her cackle laugh haha! She was an only child to my widowed grandmother.. years later when my grandmother was dying (also of metastatic breast cancer), I sat with her in the hospital for the most part of her last 3 days.. the things I learned about her in that time was far and beyond any stories I had ever heard before.. with no medication of any kind, she basically relived her life verbally to me, but seemingly unaware that all the events were already lived.. I went on to have 6 kids of own, and I have spent their lives telling them stories, sharing my likes, dislikes, childhood experiences and feelings.. it was important to  me that they knew many of the things I knew about my Mom and how those things stayed with me my whole life.. also, I ask them all the time these same sorts of things about themselves.. I usually know everyone's current favourite things, like colour, food, things to do.. I put a large emphasis on sharing these seemingly mundane details about each other.. in the end, none of it is mundane.. it's all part of what makes us special to our loved ones.. I just wish I had written more things down.. and I really wish I had some recordings"
1007,"Write things down.
You’ll think you’ll remember things about the time you’ve had together, but you won’t & it will be blurred with grief.

Tell her what you think, feel. Ask her what you want to know. Treat her as normally as you can - if you usually go to your mom for help, keep doing so. She isn’t dead yet. I know it sometimes feel you have to prepare yourself for life without her & that can feel as though you are protecting yourself and her too, but you’ll hold regrets you didn’t enjoy being able to complain about your day or ask her for help while she was still here and after she was diagnosed.

Talk. Talk. Talk. Talk about your fears, about hers. Talk about what her dying plans are and what she wants. Talk about her funeral or what service she would like. Get documents in order. Organising all of this shit when you’re lost in grief in the early days after loss is fucking horrible and having things organised as much as you can before hand helps smooth the process.

Ask her to write to you. Don’t open it until after she’s gone. It will be devastating and comforting all rolled into one when you get to read it, but you’ll treasure it. 

Understand that people will say shitty things. Or they won’t say anything because they won’t know what to say, so they avoid you instead. Be prepared and surround yourself with people who love you.

Get help - palliative help, cancer nurses/charities. There is usually help available - accept it. 

Ask her stupid questions you’ll think you’ll never want the answer to. What was she scared of growing up? Who was her first love? How did she feel about her parents when she was young? How did she feel when she got pregnant with you? Did she breast feed? Silly stuff. You’ll want the answers one day. And even if you don’t get all the answers, bonding and sharing can’t be a bad thing.

Be there with her as often as you can, but try to keep hold of some semblance of normal life. Have a bath, get a shower every day, have a walk. Little stuff like that; but don’t put pressure on yourself. 

If she’s well enough tick off aspects of her bucket list. My mother’s was to dye her hair purple and then shave her had. She wanted a tattoo too but couldn’t get it due to chemo (& at that point she was treatable, until she wasn’t and it was too late). 

Take photos. Even if she feels and looks like shit, even if you do. Take them. 

Be prepared that death isn’t like you see in the movies. People die differently. Get some support.

My mother died 4 years ago from lymphoma when she was 52 and I was 23. My dad died aged 60 when I was 24. My mum was a Palliative Nurse and the greatest lesson she left me with was how to prepare to die and how to die & what I should do afterwards. 

The biggest regret I have is that I don’t have a picture of her hands. I think about her hands and how soft they were and how when I was unwell she would stroke my head and place her cool hand on my forehead. When I saw her in the chapel of rest I couldn’t see her hands and it haunts me that I don’t remember them in detail."
1008,"My mom passed of cancer March 30th, 2019.   All three of us, her sons, were staying with her in her final weeks, and she died at home.  I'm very glad she could go that way, with her sons around her, at home. She was in very good shape until a few weeks before the end.   The last few weeks she was very fuzzy, on pain meds, and in pain from swelling in her feet, often unable to sleep unless really doped up on pain meds.   We did have ""hospice care"" which amounted to a visit once a day by some workers who helped her shower and etc.  She had some kind of insurance policy that should have paid for more help but they weaseled out of it.  (Check on anything like that, especially get a copy of the contract, then talk to your lawyer or accountant and see what it provides.)

I don't regret that we did it this way, but.... when my time comes I want to be put in a facility where the family can visit but there will be qualified personnel to take care of me, so there's less stress on family.   This might be something to discuss with her beforehand, and if she wants to go that route then start looking into it as soon as possible.

Other thoughts.  Record her voice/video and her stories about the family history.   Likewise, if there are family heirlooms lying around it's a good idea to get her on video explaining their history.  If there is anything that might be contentious about the inheritance, get it sorted out and might as well get that on video too, maybe visit an accountant with her  to discuss things.  (My father and my aunt on that side had a major disagreement when their mother died and as a result I grew up not knowing my aunt.  My mother's biggest worry is that something like that would happen between her kids.)   If she uses a computer or anything like that, get her passwords to her computer, email, etc.  Learn about her bills, in fact it'd probably be a good idea to start managing them for her.  Learn about her life insurance, annuities, etc, if she has any, you'll need to contact them after she passes and deal with them.  (Another good reason to get an accountant.)   

Think ahead about what to do about clearing out her house, especially where to put any heirloom furniture.  My mom cleaned out a bunch of stuff prior to her passing, but that was the kind of person she was, it might not be something your mom can deal with.  In the weeks after she was gone, my brothers and I did a pretty good job, under the circumstances, of cleaning out a bunch of her stuff (clothing, books) , but all of the furniture is still sitting there because we haven't gotten it together enough to move it out and into storage or something.  I think we're avoiding it.  It's not pleasant being at her house."
1009,"My grandma died about three years ago. She died sooner than expected after being diagnosed with liver cancer. She had her body donated, so there was no funeral or viewing to pay my respects and say my final goodbyes. I felt bad about it for so long until I realized she wouldn’t want me to be sad about it. 


After I was done grieving, I went out of my way to find every picture I had of her. Read every birthday card (or cards in general). I preserved every email, text message, and other forms of contact I had with her. I regrettably don’t have any videos or recordings of her. 


It was from this experience that I decided to do the same with my mom (whom is still alive). When she’s leaves a voicemail, I now save them and store them in multiple locations in case anything fails. I have a photo album dedicated to her whenever I’m able to snap a picture of her. I’ve started writing down recipes she has. I try to spend as much time with her as I can. Save all the cards and letters. I even have a playlist of artists and bands that she likes. Just little stuff that you don’t realize is that important until its gone. 


I’m currently in my mid-twenties and my mom is 52, and I think she’ll be around for a while, but it never hurts to prepare for the inevitable. My grandma passed when she was 68. I never thought she would leave so soon, but she did. I won’t tell you it’s easy or hard, or what to do, how to feel... because everyone prepares and grieve in their own way. I just hope you’re able to find a way to be with her and remember her in the best way you can."
1010,"Yes, this.  My mom passed away from breast cancer when I was fifteen, back in the early 2000's and before smartphones meant you had every opportunity to record something.  We only have one snippet of a clip where she's talking to me at my fifteenth birthday.  That's the ONLY recording we have of her voice because my stepdad threw all the old home videos (taken before he was in the picture) out when she died.

I have scoured our basement, every box, every nook, and cranny trying to here more than her saying, ""Hey, Rivlet, do your friends...should you guys go..."" before the video cuts out.

It's been fifteen years and while I can sort of remember her voice, I miss her still and wish I had more.  Pictures, voice recordings, memories.  It'd also be nice to have something to show my kids because, to be honest, words will never do her justice."
1011,"Oh my god, you have me crying. This is sad but also so beautiful. I was really close with my grandma and I always imagined I'd have one of these endings with her. Being there with her in the last moments, being able to tell how much she meant to me. But unfortunately she was taken suddenly with a heart attack all alone. It's makes me so sad that she couldn't have this type of death. I'm not trying to say your mom was lucky to die, but I think very few of us really get a proper farewell like this and it feels like a very peaceful and resolute way to go. Your mother was lucky to have a child who loved her as much as you did. She must have been an excellent mother."
1012,"I came here to say this 👆🏼So glad I spent that time with her even though it was hard to watch her dying. If you can handle it, actually be there when she passes. I am so glad I was able to be there for her and in a lot of ways it helped me process, though it was later. You will never get over it. Life will never be the same. But time will lessen the pain little by little, and you’ll be able smile again when you talk about her. 
Next month will be 5 years since my mom passed and I still have days when I cry because I miss her so much. But most of the time I can smile about her instead of crying. Every once in a while I still get the urge to call her, just out of the blue, and I can smile because I think that means she is saying hi to me. Letting me know she is near me. 
Sorry for rambling. This is such a hard process but you can get through it. Feel free to send me a DM if you have any questions. ❤️"
1013,I do escape rooms. But I never thought of it as something to pass the time. I carve out time and money for my hobbies.

1015,"He's not a famous poet, but during one of my freelance gigs, someone that I worked with decided to read to everyone, and I LOVE being read to. I didn't expect much from the poem TBH, but it slowly morphed into an emotional tour de force that haunted me. I was too shy to ask him who it was by, so I just googled some if the verses and I found it! It was written by his professor.  It has inspired me to undertake writing again, and I am debating on a script or book.

Nathaniel
  By Patrick Phillips.

Whatever it was
    that made the Reverend
        Barker stoop that way,

it meant no matter
    how much he screamed
        at my friend Nathaniel

for being late, for not
    raking the leaves,
        or for raking the goddamned

leaves the wrong Goddamned way
    (his huge, gin-blossomed jowls
        quivering with rage,

his great whale-eyes
    lost in the gray
        depths of his brow),

he could only ever scowl
    at the tops of his wingtip shoes
        or at the cuffs of the black wool suit

he always seemed to be wearing
    when he’d thunder into the yard,
        or down the stairs,

or through the little speaker
    of some payphone
        we huddled around, God

damnit Nathaniel, I told you,
    I told you, Nathaniel, Goddamnit!
        his fury repeating itself

so precisely it became a joke
    we hollered through the halls,
        changing my friend’s name

to Goddamnit Nathaniel, as in
    Where the hell’s Goddamnit Nathaniel?
        I told you, Goddamnit, to get me a Coke!

which was stupid but funny at fourteen,
    and still just as stupidly funny at nineteen,
        when we’d yell across a bonfire,

Don’t bogart that joint, Goddamnit
    Nathaniel. Haven’t I told you
        to pass the fucking bong when you’re through?

which is still funny to me even now—
    even though I look back and see,
        as I could not have seen then,

that the Reverend Barker
    only stooped that way
        because he was dying,

because cancer was eating his liver,
    and because with each day it became
        both more urgent and more unlikely

that he would ever manage to say
    whatever it was he meant
        when he’d sit at the kitchen table,

or grip the black phone,
    or stand in the darkened driveway
        after we’d all gone home,

staring at the ground and saying nothing
    to his sweet, beloved boy
        but Goddamnit

Nathaniel, listen to me.
    Listen Goddamnit.
        Goddamnit Nathaniel, now listen."
1016,"They made us memorize poems and recite them in school as part of the oral french grade. So i used to add a song’s tune to the poems to make it easier. 

Best one yet is by Victor Hugo

“Elle était déchaussée, elle était décoiffée/
Assise les pieds nus parmi les joncs penchants/
Moi qui passait par là je crus voir une fée/
Et je lui dit: veux-tu t’en venir dans les champs? “

(She had her shoes off, her hair was a mess/
Sitting with her bare feet in the tilting bulrushes/
As i passed by there i thought i saw a fairy/
And i asked her : want to go to the plains with me?) 

Theres more but that would be too long of a comment lol

Silly Old Baboon by Spike Milligan

There was once was a baboon
Who one afternoon
Said I think I will fly to the sun
So with two great palms
strapped to his arms
he started his takeoff run

Mile after mile
He galloped in style
But never once left the ground
You’re going too slow said a passing crow
Try reaching the speed of sound

SO
he put on a spurt
My God how it hurt
both the soles of his feet caught on fire
As he went through a stream
There were great clouds of steam
But he still never got any higher

On and on through the night
both his knees caught alight
clouds of smoke billowed out of his rear!!!
Quick to his aid
Came the fire brigade
who chased him for over a year

Many moons passed by
Did Baboon ever fly
Did he ever get to the sun?
I’ve just heard today,
he’s well on his way
He’ll be passing through Acton at one"
1018,"I don't think I've hit a ""lowest"" point in my life but in general I feel on the low. It is a constant kinda. I am mediocre - did not achieve many things, and even if I did - I half-assed them. My personal life currently is kind of not-existent, I feel tired all the time and not enjoying stuff. Friends come and go in my life. Work is constant, and it keeps increasing (especially now, due to COVID). I struggle with waking up and keeping a positive outlook on life. 

But I'm giving my best to battle it - I track my positive and negative habits, I try to do the bare minimum of sports and be active, so I get a bit of endorphins. It might be at home but it is something and I'm glad as hell I'm doing it. Also eating regularly and cuddling my cat, caring for her are helpful too. I've taken up a few hobbies and I try to be glad about the progress I'm making.

It is small things, but little by little I hope one day I feel different. Better."
1019,"My lowest point of time is 2017. I was a sophomore. I struggled a lot during the year especially when it comes to third semester of sophomore (we have 3 semesters per year).

In the mid of 2017, I also registered as a student under a professional body in my field. It was a tough one juggling on both degree and professional studies. In Aug 2017, I failed one of the finance mid term paper. It was my first time failing a paper. My coursework barely passed.

During the finals of the finance paper, the paper was particularly tough and its different. I came out of the hall crying out loud because I was afraid of failing the paper even tho i managed to fill up all my answers. When the results came out, it was no surprise that this subject got me a pass but it dragged my CGPA down (i was putting a lot of effort to increase my CGPA before i graduate).

After that semester, I started my internship for 6 months until March 2018. I was working on weekdays and attending classes on weekends. I told myself to come back even stronger to prove that I was not easily defeated.

Fast forward, as my internship ended, I managed to pass two professional papers at a rather good marks. Also, for the next two semesters my name was in Dean's List and President's List respectively. Nobody knew how hard I studied my ass off to get the goal I wanted.

I managed to pass my professional papers in 2 years  (Mid 2017 to Dec 2019) and I'm currently an affiliate and working at a company that I have always desired for.

Lesson of the story: Always come back stronger!"

1022,He took his 3.2 test and became a 4.1 apprentice at his Electrical Union apprenticeship- the 3.2 year was the hardest one he's ever been in so far and he was busting his ass to pass it!
1023,"He started a graduate program in January for Sports Journalism. He wants to be a sports writer. He was working in AV full time last year, making decent money, but he wasn't loving it, and he kept saying he how much he would love to talk about sports all day for a career. So I found him this program and we've been making it work financially. 

The program took a trip to Florida in the spring and he interviewed an up-and-coming MLB player. He wrote a really great article about it and it was published on Sportsnet. He FaceTimed me after and couldn't stop smiling. He was so humble about it that he could hardly believe it happened. 

He's been doing so well in school since then too, making amazing friends and making a wonderful impression on all the teachers. I can't wait to continue to watch him kick ass in something he's passionate about. "
1024,"Started his own business, and it took off. I designed his business cards, t-shirts, and Instagram profiles for fun / to help out. Going to work on his website soon haha. Seeing it grow is so satisfying! We've been through a lot job wise, especially him, so I'm really proud that he's his own boss and totally awesome at it.

Edit: it started as something fun to do on the side, and he's such a wonderful person that when people meet him they instantly love him and tell their friends and word gets out. What started small and as a passionate hobby has now turned into something he's doing regularly, and hoping to do full time soon!"
1025,"He started a new job where he had to get a certification by passing a really hard test.  I know a *lot* of people who took the same position, didn't pass, and lost their job.

From what I've heard, the swelling will go down and you will get your strength back..  it just takes a while.  This is MAJOR surgery and it's a lot to deal with.

Make sure you're taking in enough calories - smoothies fortified with protein poweder, peanut butter, full fat milk..  are all great (assuming your tummy is up for it).  If you can, take a very slow walk outside or sit in your backyard, just to get some air..  it will help with your mood.

Your end result will be amazing.  I've seen pictures.  People won't really know what's been done, you'll just look..  better and healthier.  Facial balance can make a big difference and you'll have the rest of your life to enjoy it.

Can I ask if you have an underbite / overbite?

My issue is an overbite and tiny lower jaw.  Like I mentioned, I opted out of surgery and am working with an excellent orthodontist who will do what he can with my jaw structure.  If I'm still unhappy at the end, I may look into a chin implant.

I'm mostly okay with face-on views of my face, it's just the side profile that looks off to me."
1027,"I had double jaw surgery in February to fix my open bite and underbite. For me recovery was uncomfortable more than anything. 

I read some of your comments - swelling took a few months to completely go away but I felt like I looked human again at about three weeks, enough that no one in public would notice anything abnormal. At least until I tried to talk haha. The first week is the worst and you've already passed that milestone!

I still have partial numbness in some areas, and my upper gums are still completely numb.

Food was fun, I was on a liquid diet for 6 weeks. I actually didn't have soup that much so I didn't get sick of it! I had protein shakes with a banana blended in for breakfast, and soup or stew for lunch and dinner typically. I'd often blend up what my mum was having for dinner, watered or milked down so it could be syringed or sucked through a straw. Things like curry or bolognese were good. Canned stews and soups come in so many flavours now, chunky ones can easily be blended and watered down! I stayed away from anything with sugar in it for about three weeks until I felt I could clean my mouth properly. Also, eat foods high in fibre as soon as possible! Your bowels will thank you!

10 months later I am 100% happy with my decision to go through with jaw surgery. It has been totally worth it. I can eat properly and I look waaaaaay better than I did before.

Also, I made a blog to document my experience, let me know if you would like the link! Or if you have any questions. Good luck with your recovery, it should be all uphill from here :-)"

On my dad's side--my father's father died of a heart attack and his mother died after suffering a major stroke.

Due to my family history, I had to have my first mammogram earlier this year. And despite being healthy, my cholosterol was on the high side when it was tested a few years ago. I also have symptomatic mitral valve prolapse (heart palpitations, chest pain now and then and being exhausted at times are the typical symptoms).

I exercise regularly, eat well, am at a good weight, don't smoke, etc etc, but sometimes I wonder if it'll be enough. But what do I look for? If I have chest pain then I will automatically dismiss it as being my mitral valve.

I'm only 26 and if I had to guess the number of people around my age (like within 3 years) who have passed, its probably around 15 - 20. Does anyone else feel this way, that too many people they know are dying very young? Or the opposite, are you 10 years out of high school and dont know anyone who has died?

And while it has been a wide range of causes, most seem to be suicide or drug related. Some cancer. Some car accidents. Some car accidents while intoxicated. One guy had a heart attack. Another girl was murdered by her boyfriend. Is this normal??? Or does my town have some sort of Final Destination type shit goin on?"

I want to talk to them about it before I start, because I feel so disappointed by it.. I'm happy with the way I look and I enjoy talking with people.. but this is so embarrassing for me. I feel that it ruined possible relationships I could have had. 

Whenever I hook up with someone new I finish within the first few seconds. I just laugh about it before they do and pretend as if that hasn't happened before.. but it happens all the time. 

The only way I can last a decent amount of time is if I've been hooking up with them consistently for a long time or drunk (and I dont like to drink).

My question to you is how do I talk to someone about this. Whether it's our first time or someone I've been seeing for a while?

1105,"Hello /r/AskWomen, I would like your help on getting some perspective on my situation.
The long story of this goes as follows: I have always been a chubby kid, and I adapted to my situation by putting on a thick skin and trying to be funny. In high school I was bullied by some people I had considered friends, and of course they would make fun of me for being fat. I believe this contributed to me developing a rather negative self-image, which put a damper on my ability to show interest and pursue relationships with the ladyfolk. Consequently, I have never had a serious relationship or any type of sexual contact, and I am 23 now. That situation is not good, in fact I would say it is very bad.


I think I sort of went into a downward spiral when I moved away from home to go to college and my bad consumption habits had free reign. I was at a personal worst last December: no job, out of shape, very fat, ate nothing but fast food, smoked a lot of pot, played games all day, and I was doing the bare minimum for my classes. I felt really unhealthy and I eventually had to confront myself and make some changes to avert impeding bodily disasters like a heart attack or diabetes


A few months prior to hitting rock bottom I had become friends with a rather peculiar but very cool young lady through shared our shared interest in marijuana. I think getting some perspective on her life made me realize how, well… pathetic I felt. She was a much better student than I, working an internship, in good physical shape, and just seemed to have her life in order. Even though she was three years younger than me, she had far surpassed me in overall life excellence. I considered her a remarkable individual and I had an interest in pursuing a romantic relationship with her, but it was apparent to me that she was out of my league. On the 1-10 scale I estimated her to be a solid 8 and I was like a 4. With such a disparity of apparent worth it seemed it would be inappropriate and rude for me to make any non-platonic advances towards her. 


But still, I felt like we had really good mental chemistry and she was like everything I could want out of a romantic partner. We are both very logical, analytical, well read, cultured, sophisticated as fuck, sarcastic, slightly evil, and somewhat conceited. With these traits, I don’t think either of us often meet people we really click with. With a lot of people I feel like even when they are present I am mentally alone, and I believe she feels the same way.


Anyways, starting in January I made some changes, started eating healthier, started exercising, and really tried to grow as a person and cultivate a better life for myself. I have sworn off soda, snack foods, fast food, started running daily, working out at the gym, and just spending more time outside and less time on the internets. I have lost a lot of weight since then, I’ve dropped ~75lbs and gained some muscle mass. Friends and family frequently comment on how I’m looking great now, which is sort of uncomfortable for me but still very cool. I felt really unattractive before, but I like what I see in the mirror now. I would say my lady friend inspired me to strive for greater personal excellence, and I would like to tell her about this.


I would say I’ve been working on my body image as a means to work up the nerve to ask her out, so for me there has been a lot of build-up to this. About a week ago I got drunk while we were hanging out and I made a pass at her by saying something to the effect that I find her very cool and very attractive, and she reciprocated by saying she thinks I am pretty cool and she values our plutonic friendship. I am wondering if I should tell her just how deep my feelings go, and the effect she has had on me, or if I should take what seems to be a very clear social cue that she is not interested in me in that way and let it go. So I turn it over to you, /r/AskWomen, how would you respond if you were put into a similar situation?



TL;DR: Developed a crush on a friend, used that as motivation to lose weight and improve self-image. 75lbs of weight loss later I politely make a pass at her, and am politely turned down. Want to know if I should press further and let her know what’s up, or take the hint, let it go, and move on?

1106,"Hi there lovely ladies,

I'm a 20 year old female and it's been a month (exactly) since my boyfriend of 1.5 years broke up with me. 
I've gone through the motions and confusions, and I don't really know what to think or how to go about this. He's mentioned that he's open to the idea of getting back together but it'll take some time, and not only just that. 
Basically our relationship ending was a snowball effect. It started with the complete lack of sexual intimacy (from my side). I personally have never had a sexual libido, and he had a very high one. This was major problem number one. Also I'm on the pill and have been diagnosed with Vaginismus in the past year, after a very painful first sexual experience with him. 
Also I tended to lie quite a lot, especially about sex and stuff. One of my main lies was that I was supposed to use a dilator -to help my vaginismus- and i lied to him for 4 months straight before I finally came out with the truth. This completely destroyed him emotionally and he said that that was the point he knew this wasn't going to work out. The sexual side went with the lying.
I don't understand him at the moment, he still has feelings for me, but sometimes it's just...as though he never wants to rekindle anything. He always touches my legs/kisses my hand or face or tries to show he still cares. He even has still the password on his phone as my nickname. Once he even spun me around and cuddled me very affectionately. It's like he's trying to still show some affection but also being very cold at the same time. I've actually taken to not phoning or contacting him first now, but he always comes through first. Also he mentions things that are a bit hurtful like today we were passing an art store and he just said randomly ""thats where I got the paper for your love-heart for valentines day. It cost so much per piece.'' I was just like ""why do you need to say that?""
Also yesterday, he said ""don't tag me in your Facebook status about seeing Catching Fire..because you know...It'll look weird and I don't want people to see that we are together."" That really fucking hurt. I was really put off for the rest of the night after that. He just brings up shit like that all the time without me even mentioning the relationship. If anything, I want to forget and move on, but he keeps bringing it up. He then apologised for this when I brought it up. 

At the moment, I guess I'm pretty upset, because he's gone all cold and distant and I just want to be with him so much. He was the loveliest guy, amidst the panic attacks and severe OCD. 
He told me the other day he has no interest in fixing our problems that we had with the relationship, and he'd rather work on a friendly, happy friendship. The problem is, I'll always want more out of him than a friendship. We never had sex (thanks to me...) and I feel I really missed the boat there with him because he was such a loving, patient and caring boyfriend. I've said to him I'm prepared to work through things, even if he isn't, but atm he just seems to be blocking everything and also being really negative about any future. 'Sorry it's really not going to work.' whilst hugging me tightly and also kissing my hand, it's just confusing. He thinks that if we got back together, the same problems would just arise and it would be a wasted effort. Urgh! I just wish I had some hope of something, but I know he's trying not to give me 'false hope.' 

Is this normal guy behaviour? Has this happened to any of you ladies before?  

I've told him I'm actually doing the dilators now and he's very happy with that. Also going to see a psych about my lying, so I am damn well solving my problems! :) 

Long story short, how many of you women have rekindled the relationship after taking a break? How long did it take? How did you do it? 
Thanks! "
1107,"Please forgive the novel, I'm just gonna kinda put everything on the table. It's seriously way too long of a post.

My gf and I (m) are both 26. We've been dating for about a year and a half.

We had always had a lot of mutual friends, before we dated, but we were never single at the same time, and never saw each other that often. By the time we did start to see each other, I had just finished pulling myself out of a pretty rough place. I didn't have a job, but I had saved up a ton of money from my previous job, I lived on my own, I was in a good place, and super confident. This attracted her to me, and I started laying it on pretty thick, and before long we were hooking up.

In the beginning, it was insane how much we clicked. We had similar dreams and ambitions, it was so easy for us to get comfortable around each other, we went out all the time, we had sex constantly. She, essentially, never left my place. I had had a rough couple of years before this, and I kinda just gave myself to it. We fell head over heels for each other in no time.

She ended up getting her own place, after spending maybe a month or two constantly at mine. I helped her move in, and then I just.... never left. A few months later, I got rid of my apartment. There just wasn't any sense, despite how quickly the relationship moved, that there would be any drama down the road.

And there wasn't, for a loooong time. Things were great. They were amazing.

I fucked up, though. I really never wanted that first summer to end. I wanted to keep doing things with her, I wanted to lounge with her, and I didn't really wanna do anything else. I don't think I was ever overtly clingy. She could go out and do her own thing, do things with her friends on her own, whatever, none of it bothered me, as long as we still did things together.

I gave a half-hearted attempt at a new job (which I still didn't really *need*, but that time would come). I gave a half-hearted attempt at school (which I do need, but I have serious trouble motivating myself to keep at it). In time, I really just became... a slob, I guess. Not a slob, literally. I cleaned the apartment, I took care of myself, I still showed exuberant gestures of love, but I was just always home. I didn't even make much of an effort with my friends unless my girlfriend made plans with them.

This went on... for longer than I'd like to admit. My girlfriend started pulling away. It was our rapport that made us fall in love, but the things about me that attracted her to me in the first place just didn't exist anymore.

She started to pull away. She went out with her friends, without me, almost constantly. We would be silent while she was home. Eventually she started staying the night out frequently. This started to weigh heavily on me. I hadn't put two and two together, I didn't get that I was becoming that roommate that's always in the living room that you can't avoid, I just didn't understand why she didn't want to go out with me anymore, or lounge with me. This has been going on for several weeks now, and it's been seriously eating away at me, and as opposed to motivating me, which it should have, it just drained me. I just stayed at home, feeling sorry for myself.

Anyway, onto this week. We had had a plan, several months ago, that at some point down the road, I'd move out for 6 months or so, so she could have a crack at living on her own, something she hasn't gotten the chance to experience. Anyway, this week, after seeing her for all of maybe an hour in the past day or two, she comes home, and she tells me that we need to move up the timetable, that I really need to get out of the apartment, because she feels uncomfortable coming home, and thus distracted from her responsibilities.

She never outright said we were breaking up, and she even said that she thought it would improve the relationship, but everything about the discussion... it just felt like a break-up to me. I am not, in any way, opposed to the idea of moving out. Looking back, now, on the past several months, I'm humiliated. I still gave her nice gifts, I still pulled my weight at home, but I just didn't give her space while she was here, and I didn't have a life while she wasn't.

Anyway, another day or two passes, and I'm just... in really bad shape, but things are still pleasant (though I still hardly see her). She gets home, and we have another talk. This talk, I'm acknowledging what's been going on, and the burden I've been. I'm going to move out as soon as possible, I'm gonna get work, I'm gonna land on my feet. But, I still love her, I still wanna be a part of her life, I want to help her succeed. I want her to have her own space, and I wanna be my own man. It would be our chance to date each other, because we totally skipped that part of a relationship. This discussion went pretty well. It ended with an exchange of ""I love you""s, a hug, and a kiss.

If that had been where it ended, I would be happy, but... I seriously fucked up this time. We had had plans for a while to see a movie yesterday, and I had given her loads of outs, but she still wanted to. The plan was, I was gonna clean the apartment, then she was gonna come home and we'd see the movie, then I was gonna spend the night at a friend's place so she could have a good time at the apartment without me.

I kinda... had a panic attack yesterday. I cleaned the apartment, and just... I've been pretty inside my head lately and I was just suddenly overwhelmed by the idea that I was cleaning an apartment, one that I knew so intimately, but I was a stranger to it. And I thought about all the good times or whatever, and I'm just assaulting myself with ""She's over it, dude. Give up. She's probably already seeing someone else you fucking moron."" It totally wasn't one of my prouder moments, and I was ready to just ignore it, but then I call her, just to ask what time she wanted to see the movie, and she doesn't, her friends want to go out right away once she's done with school. The maximum amount of time I had seen her at once all week was, maybe, about 40 minutes.

That just totally broke me. I brought her the keys to the apartment, and I was kinda teary-eyed, and I just told her that I was gonna be out all weekend, and I was gonna move out at the beginning of next week, and I just couldn't deal with staying in that apartment anymore. She looked totally stunned, and just said, ""I thought we had a good talk the other day."" And it just ended with her saying she'd talk to me later.

I left, and I tried to make plans with friends, but it was last minute, and I ended up sleeping in a hotel.

When I woke up, I was.... totally mortified about how I had acted. I ended up coming home, right before my girlfriend was leaving for lunch, and I apologized and said I was embarrassed and what have you, and she said it was fine. It was pleasant, but... yeah, after my pity-party yesterday, it was just different. It was just... cold, I guess. She went out to lunch, and I think she had plans to stay out tonight anyway. She might come home before then, but I don't even know if it'd be... a good thing. I feel like what I did yesterday just totally invalidates the discussion we had a few days ago. We're gonna see the movie tomorrow, but at the end of the day, and I really wouldn't be surprised if I didn't see her until then.

I'd like to think that the picture I've painted of myself in this post is less flattering than the reality, because I'm obviously in rough shape right now. I mean, I get along with all of her friends and family amazingly, I'm witty, attractive, whatever. This is the person I've been, though. And I'm really breaking down because I don't have anyone to talk to about it. All I can manage to say about her to my friends is how cool and great I think she is, and how much I love her, and I just cringe to think what she tells her friends about me.

Sorry, this went on entirely too long.

**tl;dr - My girlfriend asked me to move out, and I've handled it really, reeaally poorly. Is there any hope, upon my departure, for reconciliation? Or have I spent too long showing her nothing but the absolute worst side of me?**"
1108,"(this will probably end up long winded and run-on so TL;DR will be at the end. im gunna do my best to side both sides of this as to not make her out to be a bad person... after all every story has two sides)

**Side A:** 
I've been with my GF now for a little over a year (14 months to be exact) and things have been if not great certainly manageable. we (21m and 20f) rarely ever fight and on the very rare occasion we do, its resolved quickly since we tend to be open minded and willing to negotiate. The problem here lies in a few things... First of all my gf has a pretty prominent communication problem. I'm the guy who stresses communication pretty seriously in a relationship and she seems to have a much more blurry perception of the grey area specifically between 'taking one for the team' and 'neglecting to confront'. 99 times out of 100 this isn't a huge issue and doesn't cause a problem with us. The problem here is that over time (lets say 6months~ on) she seems to have grown distant and become less interested in me. Our sex life became virtually non existent (breaks of 1-2 months aren't uncommon even right now we're almost 2 months into a dry spell), as compared to fooling around almost daily and sex would be a few times a week. She seems a lot less comfortable saying 'i love you' in person and over all less willing to see each other 'just because' (ie outside of planned meetings or necessity) part of me understands that to some small extent these things tend to happen during a relationship at random points/intervals and im willing to accept that and move past it. My problem is it all APPEARS (see part B to see other end of this argument) these all started changing after her ex showed back up. Our get together was a tad complicated because said Ex is a very close friend of mine (was before their break up and still remains so). She and He broke up over falling apart and they both kinda saw the inevitability of it. Shortly after (less than a week) she and i got together and tried to keep the relationship on the down low for His sake (not to hide it per say but in respect of his feelings since we both still cared about him to an extent). Now i (as well as her closest friend) are convinced that he isn't over her as much as he could be and its in the realm of possibility he's trying to regain ground with their relationship. I've done my best to give her/them their privacy as far as their friendship, but lately i've been skeptical. I just dont feel like she feels the same way about me anymore and that she in a sense isn't pulling her weight in the relationship anymore...

**Side B:** 
She has a lot of stress in her life be it her parents current and 'less than clean' divorce thats in the process, her full time work schedule and full time school schedule. i COMPLETELY empathize with her on this and give her the appropriate space to work, relax, and be comfortable- while still retaining a healthy relationship. As far as the sex life goes- said Best friend mentioned before told me that this low sex drive is nothing new, and WAS prevalent during her previous relationship with said Ex. And as stated above i accept that feelings might tend to dull a little after time, and maybe she is getting a little too 'comfortable' with our relationship and is letting her belt loose a bit. And as mentioned above- she has an issue with expressing emotions and im willing to accept/work with that.  Also, i admit whole-heartedly admit i have a mild jealous side. i say mild not to downplay it but im not that horribly controlling person that pulls his girlfriend by the wrist around town, but i DO feel like she's too good for me, and belongs with someone better- thus making me insecure and jealous. Finally she hasn't done anything to me or previous Ex to prove any type of cheating going on.  

The tricky part is her ex. I get the impression (though she has never come out and said it) Mr Ex was VERY manipulative in their relationship. To the point that she doesnt know how to properly have sex (she acts as if she was instructed by Ex to 'just sit there and let him take care of it') and these occurrences have crippled her sex drive, self esteem, and emotional contact. I admit our relationship would probably be a lot less rocky and more stable if he were out of the picture entirely, but i dont think that's possible given our group of friend and the fact that i dont want that held over my head that 'i made her give up a friend for me etc etc' and even though i dont think she's the kinda girl to do that- you cant be too careful ya know?

So my final question after giving you ALL this information is: how do i approach her about these feelings? How can i tell her i feel a little neglected and one-sided without implicating shes the bad guy and responsible for all our trouble? On the converse, how can i approach the fact that i feel like Ex really screwed with her head and for the better of our relationship and more-so herself, she needs to confront it? and finally how can i confront her about not being so comfortable with her current friendship with Ex without sounding overbearing and jealous? 

**TL;DR** Girlfriend seems more distant and possibly losing interest in my over Ex, and has deep rooted problems that affect important parts of our relationship. Am i over reacting, or am i justified? if so, how can i approach these subject without attacking her, while still keeping her feelings in mind?

(Thanks for letting me rant- i know this is long as hell but i think these details are important)"
1109,"Recently found out that my best friend is a cardiac surgeon by day and resident DJ by night! How many of y’all talented women have dual or multiple identities?



EDIT: wow I’m LOVING these responses ! Kinda inspired to take up more hobbies now, who only has one life these days??😂"
1110,"I recently (about a month back) stopped using oral contraception, after being on it for about 4-5 years (I'm 21 now, I was about 16 when I got on the pill). So my last period was also about a month back. Using pill made it so I always knew when to expect my period (how many pills left + 2-4 days, and my period would last about 4 days) and I became pretty complacent about keeping track of things in a more organised fashion (before that I used calendars and tried to meticulously record everything). Now that I'm off it, I don't know what to expect. I really dread getting my period unexpectedly, especially since they tended to be extremely painful and make it impossible for me to go about my day. That was under control while on the pill (worst case scenario, I'd be off my feet for only a day. If I couldn't get rest, I'd be able to work through it with a lot of painkillers).   
  
Pain management was primarily why I was initially prescribed the pill. Some days it would be so bad, I would just pass out while at school or just randomly on the road. Of course I stayed on the pill when I became sexually active (irrespective of condom use), seeing as it was still mainly the way for me to manage my pain, plus added safety. But for various reasons, I have now decided to go off it and see how it works. I am in a committed LTR, but my SO's work and mine makes it so we spend a some months each year, every year on different sides of the continent. We have been together 3 years, and don't expect our living scenario to change in the near future. So for a good part of the year, I'm on the pill for no other reason than because I take it when we're together. I've severe migraine issues, and my neurologist was concerned the OCP was interacting negatively with my medication (which mostly works, but I'll have a bad episode every now and then). He suggested I try other contraception to see if my headaches improved. So to that effect the gynaecologist I went to (not the same person who prescribed the pill, and it will not be possible to visit her again) suggested I stay off the pill when I'm not sexually active, if I did not want to rely on condoms alone (I am pretty confident I will not ""fall out"" of the habit of taking a pill, as I've literally never missed a pill in the years I was on it).  Regarding pain she said that now that I'm older things might be different/improved on that front, and that when younger my pain and subsequent symptoms (passing out, etc) were likely exacerbated by a congenital cardiac defect that I no longer have (been operated on successfully). She just said I should continue to rely on the pain medication I had been taking, except now that was all I'd have. She did have me get an ultrasound and also examined me physically, and everything is normal. 
  
So yeah, I think I've covered the facts of my situation, but I'll edit/reply to clarify if not. I'm not worried about being pregnant, I'm worried about well, getting my period. I feel like I'm 14 again. Any anecdotes, advice, really anything. The longer it gets, the more worried I am about possibilities like passing out while I'm at work or school, grossly underestimating how often I need to change, etc."

1112,"Body acceptance has been a big message, and it’s the type of message that’s really in my wheelhouse. Yet, I’ve struggled intensely with it, because I want to believe it and I want to get there myself… but I just can’t when it comes to being overweight. I do believe that being happy is an essential key to maintaining a healthy weight (negative reinforcement creates eating disorders and psychological problems, not health!), but as much as I’ve sat with myself and improved my mindset, I don’t love my fat. I’ve removed the psychological blocks that kept me from doing things that I want “until I’m thin”:  I have a good relationship, I enjoy exercise, clothes and sex. But I still view my belly as something that needs to be fixed. I don’t love my body. The simple truth is it’s uncomfortable to be overweight. I sweat. My jeans chafe against my stomach. Sometimes the arms of seats poke into my thighs, sometimes the tables at booths press into my stomach. I might avoid a rickety looking stool or chair if I’m not sure that it can support my weight. My shoes wear out faster and sometimes I hurt my ankle or knee just from being active it a normal way, like walking to work. I don’t currently have any health issues (blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol), but I know my risks will increase with age. I don’t hate my body. I think I’m pretty cute. I believe my partner when he tells me I’m sexy. I can sustain more activity than you might think from looking at me, I love walking everywhere and stairs don’t wind me. I don’t feel self conscious walking down the street. I’m okay now shopping at plus size stores for clothes that fit me well. I don’t binge or hide eating like I used to. I meet new people, I travel. I'm not perfect, but I've improved my self esteem alot and overall really enjoy my life. But I don’t love my body… I don’t hate my body, is that okay end point? You’re never going to see a Dove ad with “Don’t hate your body” plastered in white cursive across the screen, it's just not the brightest message. But is it more realistic? Accepting being overweight isn’t the same as becoming okay with the mole on my face or the birthmark on my hip. It’s not like embracing pregnancy stretch marks, it’s not letting go of the idea of a six pack or certain size of clothing that my frame would never be. Accepting being overweight is accepting all the uncomfortable things that come with it and I don’t know if I can. Being overweight is something I can change and my life would probably be better for it (assuming I do it in a healthy way--both physically and psychologically. I’ve become thin through unhealthy means before and know, in and of itself, it doesn’t solve the problems you think it will when you’re overweight.)  I love the idea of treating people well, regardless of their looks. I love the idea of loving yourself. I love the idea of not holding yourself back. But, to me, saying love your overweight body is saying “settle” and I don’t love that. Is this spreading negativity, shooting myself in the foot? What do you think and how do you feel about body acceptance?"
1113,"Would you ever play with his hands, cuddle with him, stroke his hair etc. Where is the line drawn for you?"
1114,"I'm talking about how he uses his penis in you just in case you haven't guessed that yet.

**Long strokes**= The guy pushes in deep and pulls almost all the way out to his head and then pushes all the way back in with each stroke/thrust of his penis

**Deep short strokes**= The guy pushes in deep and then just kind of rocks back and forth inside you only moving back and forth an inch or two at most so his penis is almost all inside the whole time he thrusts

**Shallow short strokes**= The guy puts his penis half way or less inside your vagina and doesn't really go any deeper. For an average size guy he only goes a few inches past his head and pulls almost all the way out before going back in during each stroke/thrust he makes

I know lots of girls might like all three but try to decide on a favorite if you can. Which one makes you come more often?

Also if you can add any other tips on how a man should thrust when inside you. I would really appreciate it."

1118,"My mom has stage 4 cancer and recently had a stroke and I feel like she might not be here for too much longer, be it a few days or another year. I feel like I'm wasting my last days with her. We joke around and talk about light things and I'm enjoying spending time with her, but I know in the future I'll think of all these important things that I wish I knew but I'll never be able to ask. Things like why she fell in love with my father and what her fondest memories are. Can you think of things that I'll wish I knew later? This might not be the best subreddit, but this is one of the safest spaces I can think of and I trust you ladies (and gentlemen).

Edit: thank you all so much for your show of support. I'm reading through the replies slowly since its not really something I can focus on for too long. I've actually never deleted a voicemail from anyone I care about in years just in case something happened to them. My boyfriend jokes that I can be really morbid, but I have dozens of messages from her and anyone else whose left one.

 She's disoriented and cranky now, I'll try to get some stories out of her in a couple days when she's feeling more herself. 

She had a seizure on Wednesday morning about 3am and has just woken up from that and she's doing alright now, so hopefully she'll be out in a few days.

Edit 2:  I've been living with mom for the past 6 months since she got diagnosed, which I feel is a huge advantage since I've been able to spend a bunch of time with her these past 6 months.  She even called me her best daughter, when I was always #2 of 3 (parents pretend they don't have favorites, we all know better).  She knows how much I love her and she sees all the things I do to make her comfortable and happy.  I know how much she loves me and she's said her entire life that her girls are her pride and joy and the best thing to happen to her (except the teenage years for me and one sis) so even if she were to die unexpectly, or hell, even months ago I'd still know deep in my heart for the rest of my life that we knew how much we cared about eachother."

- **how many strokes between each rinse of the razor?**

 If not, what were the broad strokes, were they more authoritarian, more permissive? How did they handle discipline? How did they handle you transitioning to adulthood?

Were you able to communicate with them? Did you feel loved and respected? Do you feel they helped you become effective and healthy adults? If not, are there specific things you can pinpoint as problems caused by their parenting style?

1127,"A little background: My boss is originally from China and he and I share a fairly friendly professional relationship. After some conversations with him, I learned:

a) that he used to go fishing when he had free time in graduate school and 

b) he had two incredibly smart dogs as a kid in China whom he trained to do errands 

I do freelance graphic art in my spare time and have considered doing a painting for him in a traditional Chinese brush stroke style showing a guy fishing with his two dogs playing nearby. I'm worried this gift would be a little too personal and/or disrespectful (as in, stereotyping culture or something, I don't know). Thoughts?

1129,"I cycle between having chin-length hair and hair to about mid-way down my back because I grow it out to donate.  I like short and long hair on myself for different reasons, but where other people are concerned, I've noticed that having long hair is a constant conversation starter...for better or worse.  

I am currently in a long hair phase, and it seems like my hair is a magnet for unwanted attention.  I haven't felt comfortable wearing my hair down for a couple months now because it was getting to the point that *every single time* I wore it down, someone (both strangers and acquaintances) would stroke it and go on and on about it.  But even when it's tied up, people still reference it--- A few casual friends kind of sarcastically comment on it; when guys hit on me, they almost exclusively use comments on my hair as an opening line; my coworkers bring it up repeatedly to check in on whether I'm going to keep growing it out; a woman on the street asked me if I wanted to sell it; and another woman on the train was harassing me for an extra hair tie, claiming that I *must* have some because of how long my hair is.  All of that, and it's only a few inches past my shoulders, it's not like it is an exceptional length or anything.

It just strikes me as odd that as soon as my hair gets past a certain length, people start paying a shit ton of attention to it, whereas when it's shorter, it's just kind of a neutral part of my appearance.  Something about longer hair on me makes it an ""invitation"".  It's kind of weird, and I get tired of talking about my damn hair so much.

My haircare routine is pretty minimal - wash with shampoo and conditioner (the type varies by season), usually air dry, and brush...

I see so many people out there with gorgeous hair that appears to not tangle easily, and if the wind blows it doesn't instantly mess it up (like the individual strands are sliding past each other). How do you do it? Does brushing each section of hair for longer help?

My question is about sending photos of myself - I don't exactly try new make up or hairstyles so that category is irrelevant, but out-of-the-blue pics from the male half of the relationship seem pretty unusual. I'm not thinking ""here's a picture of my cock, please stroke my ego"" but something to keep the flame going during a long stretch of being apart.

1139,"I've talked about it with her a couple of times before, but at the time my main reason was because I wanted shorter and less heavy periods.

Although I was sexually active when I first brought up the conversation, I've recently become closer with this guy and now I'm having sex way more often than before. We've had unprotected sex a few times, where he's just pulled out (I know, I know.. very bad). So basically pregnancy prevention is my main focus now.

To kind of explain, I recently had a huge stroke of luck in many things and one of the things was a job with a certain professor, who to put it kindly, had a slip up with a student many years ago.

Ever since then I've been doubting myself, so to speak, as in are my opportunities really just because someone thinks I've got a nice face?

"
1144,"So a friend of mine met this guy while playing an MMORPG, and in the past two weeks he's proposed marriage twice, and told her he loves her at least three times. Twice she's made him cry by telling him she was going to delete him on Facebook. However, she's apparently given him her email address, phone number, and address, and is planning on meeting him in person over winter break or Thanksgiving. I've begged her not to, and in a recent stroke of genius, I said this ""I can't control your actions, but I certainly will not approve of them. If you're gonna hang out with this guy, at least have a trusted male friend with you, okay?"" 

What I'm wondering is, am I being a good friend or am I overstepping any boundaries, and is there anything else I can do to protect her? I would like to let it be known that I have no ulterior motives here, romantic or otherwise, and we are currently separated by many miles."
1145,"Throwaway, obviously. Also, probably TMI.

So I suffer from depression (I have started up treatment again recently), so it's been quite a while since I've had sex, due to a lack of will. The last girl I really got close to (last summer) left me soon after I told her I did not want to get physical (due to me using her for emotional support and not wanting to lose that, yes this was not a good idea). This past weekend a friend of mine brought me out when a friend of his girlfriend was visiting from out of state. We all hung out, had a good time, and long story short, I ended up having sex with her at the end of the day. We had been getting along awesomely. We both were aware beforehand that sex was probably going to happen, barring any unforseen consequences. We didn't discuss it, but when we were finally alone, we jumped to it.

Unfortunately it wasn't that good. She was very attractive, and I had been told that she was attracted to me. There was no pullback or shyness when I was making moves. But here's what happened. Please note that I have actually never had a one night stand before, and have always had sex after about two or three weeks of dating (and they had always been friends beforehand).

She wanted me to do all the work and wasn't interested in reciprocating. She also kept wanting to drink more beer, and I had to take the can away from her a few times. I fingered her, and even quickly went down a few times. She was obviously enjoying it, telling me when it was too hard, where to position, moaning, and telling me not to stop. She dug into my back and said my name when I went deep inside her. However, she kept wanting to do it missionary only. We were on a couch, so the few times that we transitioned to the upright position where I'm sitting and she's on top of me (where it's actually comfortable for me), it didn't last long before she got off and had me go back on top. She eventually orgasmed, laid there a minute then shot up saying she hurt and went to the bathroom.

When she came back she looked done and said she wanted to put her pants back on. Obviously, I had not gotten off yet, and said this. She asked what I was expecting her to do. I said anything she was comfortable with. She told me to take the condom of, so I did. She stroked me for about two seconds and then told me to put another condom on. So I did, and sat on the couch, she got on top for about two seconds and then laid back down and told me to get on top. So I did and finished. I went to the bathroom, and when I came back she was fully dressed and lying down on the small couch. I tried to get her to sleep with me on the big couch (we had one blanket and pillow, plus the small couch is cramped) but she said she didn't like sleeping next to people. So I gave her the big couch and pillow/blanket and slept cramped on the small one.

What happened here? Since she lives in another state I won't see her again, but the next day I was feeling really sick and depressed. I don't know if it was me, or her, or this is just what happens during one night stands, or what. I asked my friend if I should send her a message on facebook (we're not friends on there) and he said no, that I'm fine. I don't want to contact her because the whole experience was really quite awkward and I don't feel good about it. I am feeling a little rejected because she didn't seem interested in helping me out at all, even though I focused a lot on her. I deleted the dating website account I had set up, cancelled my next date from there, and am not feeling good about future sexual prospects at all.

So... had a bad one night stand. What happened? Maybe I should have posted this to /r/offmychest, but I wanted some perspective from women who are complete strangers.

Here's to hoping she's not a redditor."
1146,I have recently become at a higher risk of stroke and am debating switching from my normal birth control pills to a non hormonal IUD. I would love to hear what some of your experiences have been on an IUD. Is it worth it?
1147,"I've accepted my place as a ForeverAlone, and have no illusions about a relationship or anything. 

And I acknowledge that the only interaction I'm going to have with women is me approaching and being shot down. So I might as well enjoy it.

But I'd like to think I'm actually providing a service for women, since it entertains them to reject an inept, awkward, retarded freak like me. And I seem to get a positive reaction most of the time. 

On the other hand I feel bad that women, have to be harassed all day by creeps and jerks. And I like to think my approaching is so inept, it actually amuses them. And maybe strokes their self-esteem a little. 

But maybe thats just wishful thinking. 

So thats why Im asking askwomen. 

Is rejecting guys an enjoyable experience? Does it make you feel better about yourself? In what ways can I make it more entertaining? "
1148,"I am working at a two-person nonprofit organization, am in my second month, and can't take any more of the job. 

The organization has a great mission and compared to other offices I've worked at, my boss is a good guy. He's extremely pessimistic though, and doesn't have much respect for my time - he is constantly complaining, mocking emails he receives (after reading them out loud a few times), or storytelling, which makes it difficult to focus on my work. We work in a glorified closet, and he has asked me to refrain from headphones, so there's no escaping the chatter. 

Recently I've noticed that his sour outlook has been affecting my home life. I dread going in to work. It feels like I'm carrying his emotional baggage uphill. 
The work is also mundane. I haven't been able to do almost anything that I was actually hired for - instead I'm ""gal Friday"" for my boss. 

The organization isn't related to my career at large, but I was excited to get some experience that I've since realized I won't come in contact with.

In a stroke of luck, I have a few job opportunities waiting for me. I freelance regularly and could amp up my efforts there, I'm working on a few projects around town, and am halfway through an interview process for a full-time position in my desired field. Not having employment does not concern me at the moment. 

I'm nervous about submitting my resignation because I don't know how my boss will react, but can reasonably assume it would be negative. Also, I've requested a week off for family matters, and that would be the second week of my two weeks' notice. 

That being said, I don't want to burn bridges. What can you suggest?"
1149,"Sort of a follow on from the desire post but I’d like to hear mainly about this action.

What does it feel like to be inseminated [“naturally”]?  Is it a relatively simple hot wetness, or is there more going on?  I’ve heard from one girl it sends a tingle up her spine.  How strong is the desire to want this during sex?  What are your thoughts before, during, and after?

I’ll set the stage with my general experience and the whole backstory since it’s not too long:

I’m going in and out which feels very good.   I’m acutely aware of the warmth, moisture, and soft tug as I slide.  Being inside feels unbelievable and is a strong emotional experience.  Without trying to be too grandiose, it feels like my essence or soul has relocated down South because the body is numb and each thrust is euphoric and feels like the only important thing in the world.  Giving a sloppy kiss feels very passionate and connected and tends to up the speed setting for a bit.  All thoughts are slowed down and there is a deep feeling of oneness and union that is also unbelievable -- I’m not religious but this feels “spiritual” to me.  I’ve only been with people I truly care about, which may be part of it, as “making love” sounds right to me.

So this goes on for a long while and eventually there’s a rising swell.  My jaw drops a bit and eyes widen.  Intense pleasure overtakes my body.  One way or another I’m going to finish.  I might let out an “oh my god” or something cheesy like “I’m so in love with you.”  I have enough control to pull out if I need to, but oh wow it feels great to go all the way.  The actual ejaculation feels like a throbbing, not overly powerful locally but the body high is at its strongest for the next few moments.  The feeling is full blown ecstasy now - full body pleasure but with just a ting of something else, maybe a hint of emptiness as I let it go but that sounds bad and it really isn’t.  The whole process is something akin to an alcohol buzz and a runner’s high but more powerful.  A sense of accomplishment and satisfaction sets in.  Following this is a deep relaxation and tranquility.  My favorite thing to do is stay inside as we both pant and let our heads stop spinning.  After a couple minutes this sometimes leads to another go, especially if it’s been a few days since I’ve last ejaculated.  This wind down is also very pleasurable and endearing, maybe a soft kiss and gentle stroke as you’re still intertwined.

I want to stress the psychological win afterwards.  I feel very human and in touch with reality.  And even still “I can’t believe we just did that” sets in afterwards :p
"
1150,"Hi ladies. Let me preface this by saying I understand its different strokes for different folks. Everyone has their preference. 

I'm an ass-man, but I will acknowledge a nice rack when I see one. 

My question is what does an ideal ass for a man look like? Or better yet, can you give me examples of who has one? 

Sorry for the dumb question. TIA"
1151,"I don't exactly need one like Will Ferrell's in Blades of Glory, but I'd like one a bit better than the hairbrush I'm using now. I currently own a $10 Conair hairbrush, looks like it's mostly plastic. You can hear the static after one brush stroke! I've tried using a dryer sheet to cut down on the static, but I'd rather buy a nice brush that eliminates this need altogether. 

Any suggestions? Also, I apologize if I am posting this in the wrong subreddit; I will be more than happy to delete and re-post in the correct forum if necessary!"
1152,"**Doing things together**

The worst thing you can do is not make a bad choice, but make no choice at all. Every man will be faced with those moments when he either can’t be bothered to think of something to do with his beloved, or he really can’t come up with any ideas. “What do you want to do?” are the most terrifying words a man will hear, next to “I missed my period” and “I had lunch with my ex.” Whatever you say, don’t sound wishy-washy. Even if your idea sucks, it’s better to forcefully present a sucky idea than to waver and say you’ll do whatever she wants to do. Now, this doesn’t mean you don’t get any input from her. It means you offer a suggestion, and be flexible if she makes a counter-suggestion.

**Shopping together**

If you get that expectant “Will you buy this for me?” look from your woman, muse thoughtfully about the product, and then announce it would look great on your mistress. Ask your girlfriend/wife if it comes with a motorcycle. Wait a few months, and then buy it for her. The object here is to never get caught being the type of man that asks “How high?” when his woman wants him to jump.

**Making it rain**

If you’re going to spend beaucoup bucks on your girl, (and you’re a well-off man for whom the expenditure is inconsequential), don’t get her “stuff.” Buy her experiences instead. Two plane tickets to a European city will be appreciated more fondly than a thousand pieces of jewelry.

**The crying game**

Every so often a girl just needs a good cry. Maybe she had a bad day at work, her parents are bugging her, or she got a shitty haircut. Let her tumble into your arms to sob it out. And, though this won’t need saying for the more experienced men in the audience, don’t say anything. Over and over, I’ve rediscovered the power of keeping your trap shut when a woman is in the midst of an emotional draining. Hug, stroke, and silently sympathize. That’s all you need to do.

**Compliments and flattery**

Keep it rare, spare and unawares. The best compliments are unexpected, and evenly divided between being romantic and raunchy.

**Advice**

Don’t bother.

**Conversational fluff**

Expect that in any relationship, she will be doing 75% of the talking, and you will be doing 75% of the head nodding. If you don’t like this, you should be dating a man.

1153,"So I've gotten different feedback from different women, but I'd like to ask a broader audience. 

Does it bother you/your vagina if a guy has scruff? 

Does the length of the facial hair make it better/worse?

Do you prefer that I shave you a seat?

From what I've gathered, it's usually different strokes for different folks, due to sensitivity or softness of the hair in question.  I'm a bit torn though, since I'm told that I look better with facial hair, but never want to make a box lunch unenjoyable. What do you ladies think?"
1154,"I met a girl and we really hit it off together, and became a couple pretty quickly. One morning about 3 weeks later, I woke up to see her looking down fondly at me. She stroked my hair, and explained that if we married that she would have to keep her own last name as her first name sounded terrible with my last name, and hyphenating hers with mine didn't really help. Surprised and not a little *WTF'd!?* I responded with a clever, ""okay"".... but the romance really ended that morning for her, and we split not too much after that.  Some years later,  I learned she was married, and had indeed hyphenated her last name with her husbands."
1155,"To me (and I'm guessing a large percentage of guys), it's kinda vaguely nice, but not much moreso than being stroked anywhere else. 

For those that are into it, how would you describe it?"
1156,"So some context there was this girl and we met at a martial arts gym I go to (this will be important later) I just turned 18 she turns 17 in a month. I have opted not to go for college for now and I'm a little scared of never meeting anyone in the real world. I have only had two girlfriends so I suck at women.

Now what happened we met at the gym where I am pretty much my happiest and most charismatic. one day she walked in she was hot but I was talking to another girl from school back then so I didn't take notice. Well time passed and it became pretty evident to everyone except me that she liked me... I was a clueless idiot and another girl had my attention. So everyone keeps telling me she likes me and at first I just laugh it off and don't think much of it but as time progresses I begging to notice her more and more soon I develop a crush on her and then we start face timing and talking on the phone! Turns out shes pretty damn awesome haha but we had a really weird thing going where we both liked someone else and we both liked each other as well. So we both pick the other person and we both get rejected. We both talk again but are more reserved when we talk to each other than we used to be i didn't like this very much but i just kept going and then we both find someone new that we like she gets asked out by another guy and says yes. I decided you know (let's call her R) I regret not choosing R the first time so this time I think you know fuck this chick I'm just gonna go after R now. A few days later she has a boyfriend like I mentioned earlier so I'm hurt for sure but I decide whatever if she's happy that's good enough and I just try to be a friend. Well she is always very honest and candid (one of the traits I appreciate most about her.) and she tells me about their relationship and says she was just kinda ready for a boyfriend and she liked him but she had a crush on another guy as well. So after a bit of prodding she says it's me that she has crush on.

So this is where I get weird. I in my infinite wisdom decide you know what I'm gonna just back off and let R and this guy be together without me interfering. Idk why I decided to do that I still liked her and idk but I did it... Well for about a month then I notice her looking said a few days in a row at the gym and I talk to her and we start talking on the phone again. My intentions where pure just help out my friend and see what was wrong but she started talking about all the things he did that she didn't like and he was upsetting her in general. She talked about how I was better than him (witch stroked my ego nicely) and we started flirting and she seamed much happier now and we went swimming and hung out and shit was great!!!! Until one day we were in the gym playing around and wrestling which turned me on of course haha so I kissed her on the cheek she just laid there and barely blinked. After a few seconds she said something along the lines of ""wow you kissed me even though I'm all sweaty and ugly"" we soon went home.later we talked about it over the phone she said that she wished I had kissed her on the lips (I wish I had the balls to have done it) but she was still dating this other dude and I couldn't kiss her. So I didn't and I stopped texting her and we became friends again and things seemed kinda normal.

Then she broke up with her boyfriend and I was fucking ecstatic! Things were weird for a while she was a little sad over the break up but after a week she was back to being herself again. We flirted every second we were around one another but we would never text or call each other and for a while it went on like this until I had a fight coming up and I blocked her out a bit and just focused but we would still flirt a bit and she would text me a lot and always be positive so ya. Fight day comes and I win! She was in the crowd and after I'm done my family and friends come congratulate me and she is standing off to the side I spot her looking awkward and cute. haha I finish talking to my family and I run over to her pick her up twirl her around and I just feel like fuck ya!!! So it was kinda the best day of my life and we spent the rest of the day lounging around laying on each other and talking and just bliss.

So I finally decide to ask her out three days later she has still been pretty affectionate towards me.I ask her to go see spiderman she says she can't that's cool i'll find sometime shes not busy. But then she acts very cold towards me the next day and I take poorly that she's so suddenly cold towards me (this freaks me out I am not a jealous guy I'm not a clingy guy but if a girl I like doesn't like me I try to get away from her because I didn't want my heart broken).so the next day we are having a 4th of July party she try's to be with me again and I just push her away the entire time and she gets pissed about it. Any way later we talk about it sort of so things are back to normal.

Your close to the end I promise!!! Things are normal but we both don't really flirt we just act like friends except it pretty tense. I take the strategy of well if she wants me she can come get me. I don't call her text her or go out of my way to talk to her then she does talk to me more and she things are warming up again!! She leaves for two weeks to go out of town I leave for one week and I don't text her at all I hoped she'd text me and she did the day before we were going to see each other inane she just said ""I miss your face"" we talked a bit I was happy and now we are up to current. I have no clue what to do now her dad has out of nowhere decided he doesn't like me monday, she ignored me Tuesday and she went bowling with another guy on Wednesday I can't tell if she likes him or not I'm not jealous I'd just like to e with her. So ya we haven't texted at all so I guess my question is should I go after her and maybe text and call her (not to much though) or just continue with if you want me you have to come to me strategy? Thanks and I'm sorry it's do long!!!!

1157,"I've only ever done nursing, I work in the Emergency Department, a typical day is working with 2 other nurses looking after 10 cubilcles of people with things like abdominal pain or chest pain. What about you guys?"
1158,"I'm a *bit* buzzed, and I honestly think this post would be better suited to..... any other sub, but I came here. *Please* bear with me.

I'm 25, my gf is 26, we've lived together for a bit over a year, dating for a short time before that.

As a boyfriend, I think I would describe myself as ""awesome."" I show random gestures of love, be they gifts, or cards, or what have you. I clean the apartment, do the dishes, I make a tremendous effort to build a rapport with all of my gf's friends. I let her know how attractive I find her constantly, but I never smother her, I let her go out with her friends or siblings without me, without a word. I consider myself pretty handsome, witty, charming, funny, etc etc. I feel like I'm almost constantly going that extra mile, often without any sense that it's being appreciated. I listen to all of her ideas, concerns, passions, and I'll share in them.

As a *man*? I would describe myself as ""sub-par,"" on a good day. I'm lazy and unmotivated. I can be judgmental, petty, or just generally a downer. When I'm enrolled in school, it's just a few classes that I'm barely invested in. When I have a job, it's meaningless and directionless. I'm *extremely* generous with money, when I have it, but the second I'm out, I'm a nervous wreck, absolutely no fun to be around. My girlfriend and I have a ton in common, but the core difference between us is that she's working towards her life goal, and I'm kinda just floundering, hoping for some miracle I'm in no way working towards.

Anyway, here we are. Today my gf found out I'm not enrolled for school for the Fall. I honestly couldn't be, I have *no* money right now, and I *need* to find work (something I'm working towards in the slowest, laziest way imaginable). She hasn't talked to me all day. She found out and was furious. She left for school, and immediately went out with her friends afterwards. I *totally* get where she's coming from, but I feel like she's not even considering, for a moment, what *I'm* going through. I could have asked my family for some money, but I have *serious* reservations about doing that (a trait she doesn't share). I've been an absolute wreck for the past few weeks because of my current financial situation, and that's been totally lost on her. She claims she ""could've helped me,"" but that's absurd, she's in the same financial straits as I am right now. I could have payed for tuition, but the idea of her paying for books, gas, food, what have you, is *impossible.* I've been skipping meals I'm so short on money, and she's about in the same boat.

Part of me feels like this is, honestly, the straw that broke the camel's back. I don't know where those other straws came from, though. When she goes out, it's only ever with her friends. We only ""hang out"" in the capacity that we're both in the apartment, doing our own thing. We do *nothing* together. I used to *love* that we could do that, but that's when we used to go out occasionally. I've told her that I want to go out and do things, but it amounts to nothing. She'll go on a vacation with her friend, she'll go drinking with her sister, and then when she's home, she'll watch a TV show and I'll be on my laptop, in total silence. On top of that, we'll have sex one or two times a *month.* If that's okay for her, cool, but why aren't *my* needs being met? I show the random gestures of love, why can't she do so much as give me a handjob occasionally (I wanna stress, I feel like the biggest asshole of all time saying this, but I just want to put everything on the table right now)?

I'm not perfect. I'm *faaaaaar* from perfect. I totally love this woman though, and I make every effort to show it. I'm getting nothing back.

I'll stop myself there, though. That's me putting the blame on her, which is bullshit of me. I've shown so little motivation in bettering my life. To her, I *cringe* to think how I must look. For all of my qualities, I'm a lazy asshole, and finding out that I'm, at this point in my life, putting off school for the jillionth time, *has* to be wearying.

Soooo, yeah. I'm scared, right now, that she's putting up with all of this right now out of some misguided sense of pity, or obligation, or what have you. This is *her* place, and I'm the one with no money, she might think that I'd be homeless if she broke up with me now. My birthday is in, literally, just a couple of days, maybe she doesn't want to ruin that for me. I could find a friend to stay with, and I'd be back on my feet in weeks, when push comes to shove. I've never really had a memorable birthday, stuff like that means nothing to me, I'd be fine.

I just feel, sometimes, like I'd be doing her a favor if I broke up with her. I'm a downer, I'm lazy, I'm a prick. I also feel, though, like that's me being *painfully* aware of my own flaws, without her being aware of her own, or without her acknowledging my good traits. 

I dunno, I'm all over the place, I'm so sorry for wasting anyone's time. I just had to get this off my chest, and it felt prudent to do it for women, and I can't explain why. I honestly won't begrudge any downvotes or anything."
1159,"I ask because I just pruned my fingertip with bypass shears, despite the fact that it bears exactly zero resemblance to a calendula seed head….

EDIT: I really hope this isn't an offensive post due to the example above. Its just an honest answer, guys like sex and making the act less taboo and more available would surely make any guy happy. This isn't the case and wont ever be for a long time however. Cultural norms and such. "
1161,"There's this girl I've known for a while... we kind of dated at one point towards the end of high school, but we had to break up because of her overprotective father, who wouldn't allow her to see boys and watched over her like a hawk. 3 years later, nothing has changed, and I kind of wanted to give it another chance. 

Is there any way to bypass the overprotective father or should I just back down from any hopes of dating a girl whose dad won't even let her see boys?

I'm not only asking for my situation, but this seems to be such a common thing and I really don't know what the proper response is. Respect her father's boundaries, encourage her to resist? I mean she's 20 for goodness' sake.

Do any of you have an overprotective father, and if so, what advice can you offer?"
1162,"I'm currently in the middle of a storm with my mother.

She is 62 years old and had surgery on her spine last Tuesday. She seemed completely fine on Wednesday. On Thursday she seemed groggy. I chocked it up to the surgery wearing her out. 

On Friday I couldn't reach her on the phone. She lives about 30 minutes from me. My SO and I were going to go to have dinner at his parents who live about 15 minutes from her. With the feeling I had in my gut I decided to drive separately and check on her before dinner. I never made it to dinner. 

I walked in on my mother slumped over on the couch, telling me there were bugs crawling all over the floor and that there were people in the house hitting the cats and moving her things. The house was a mess, and medicine bottles were open on the night stand, but she claimed she couldn't find them. She was telling me about things that had never existed in the house( ""What did you do with the passage way to the bathroom. It was right here!"" as she tried to walk behind the couch into the wall) About things that hadn't happened in years. I called 911 and had her taken to the hospital. 

At the hospital she was diagnosed with sepsis (fully body infection), memory loss, and hallucinations. They transferred her from the hospital 15 minutes from me to the hospital that she had her surgery in 2 hours away. The ER doctor straight up told me that they didn't want to take the blame if what was happening had something to do with the surgery. 

Since then, its been waiting on her memory to return and for her body to get back to normal. She has been slowly getting better, can hold a normal conversation, can walk around and slowly do things now. She has no memory of what happened. Absolutely nothing. Doesn't remember anything between Thursday night to sometime Monday. This is the second time this has happened this year and I still have no definitive answers from the doctors. The first time this happened I'm not aware there were any hallucinations, but she couldn't remember anything including how to put underwear on. It was as if she had regressed to being a 2 year old. 

I'm getting concerned about her health and well being. I'm not even sure where to start with how to get her the care she needs. I've started looking into senior living facilities but all of them are far more expensive than I can even begin to touch. There is one place in the area that is income based, but there is an obviously long waiting list. I'd move her in with me, but she has 3 cats, I have one of my own, and I'm living with my SO and a roommate and we don't have the room for four more beings in the house. 


I'm not even sure where to start looking. Is there a thing where people can come and check on a person once or twice a day? I'd prefer that if something happens she'd be able to get in contact with someone quickly, or I'd be able to call and see if they can check on her. 

I'm tired of feeling like I'll have not heard from her for a day or so and I walk into her dead on the floor. Its only me as far as her family goes. My uncle exists, but hes currently in the process of trying to get a brain tumor removed and lives about an hour and a half away.

Or it seems to be the age which people say someone is finally “too old” for a lot of things (like dressing a certain way, or feeling unsure in life, which someone who is only a couple of years younger gets a free pass for). I’ve even seen people here say that once you’re 25, you’re not “young” anymore (this is also implied when I see posts targeted towards “older women”, 25 is always the cutoff age)?

She also claimed to be plural and speak for all women, so maybe she's not quite all there?

(I used the search function, and the only use of the word ""cheesecake"" was something about leftover oreos and cream cheese).

1173,"Hello, I could really use some help. I am a 17 year old girl and recently (the past 6 months maybe), I decided to try to improve my cardiovascular health and also build muscle, as well as eat healthier. I have been running and hitting the weight circuit 3 or 4 times a week consistently. I've been a vegetarian since childhood but am eating better than ever- almost no processed foods, lots of lean protein like greek yogurt and cottage cheese, blah blah blah. I cannot make it clear enough, however, THIS IS NOT TO LOSE WEIGHT, just to get healthier. At 5' 1"" and 105 lbs, I'm at a good weight. So here's my issue. I haven't gotten my period the past 4 months. I've lost 3 lbs accidentally the past 6 months, but I have been eating enough and 105 is still an acceptable BMI. I feel like I should go to the doctor or something, but I'm scared to tell my mother why I need to go. She is slightly overweight and overreacts to a healthy diet and exercise-she thinks I've been excessive and unhealthy, and is always encouraging me to eat more dessert and exercise less. If I tell her about this I'm scared it'll be an ""I told ya so!"" and a demand that I pick back up my previous habits.

What do I do? Should I just not go to the doctor? What's the worst that could happen? Will my body adjust to this new routine and start ovulating again? Please help!!
EDIT: thank you guys. I talked to my mom and I'm seeing my doctor next week"
1174,"I'm older (F) and he's older too. We've had an on again, off again, LDR for two + years now. (Five hour commute for me and it's relevant in context.)

I drove away from his place the morning of Dec. 31st utterly disgusted by his best 'gal pals' behavior and his complete dis-respect towards me because of them, the night before. 

Late March he sends a text msg. My antenna is on High Alert. I wait. Then respond,  reserved. He starts blowing up my phone! At this point I'm fully aware that he's got some stuff happening in his 'little world' that has nothing to do with me and having 'tasted' his pathological lies, narcissistic bent, and massive BS factor; I'm all 'in'!

April he's pretty 'mushy & gushy' and he's straining to maintain!

 He pops over here that last weekend. We have a good time.  I chose a top rated, out of the way Restaurant and the meal was out of this World Delicious and the bill was modest. He complimented me!!!!(SHOCKER there!)

I give him some Medical/Dental Health ultimatums blah, blah, blah.... (also relevant in the length of time given to this relationship...) Thank him for coming over...

Fast forward a few days and I'm cooking with my grown kids and my phone rings. Normally, I never pick up a call on my cell from an unknown number, ever!!!!!!

The man is introducing himself as my 'guys' attorney and he wants to know if I'm willing to speak with him on behalf of 'his client'.... I nibble and he starts telling me this story.

His attorney begins telling me a story of a woman that was injured. His story doesn't at all match what I was told. His story doesn't at all match and so I tell him what I knew, I asked questions, he answered and it became clear that there was a second 'woman injured in the same manner, as the first! 

His own attorney described her injuries to me as ""gruesome, deep  wounds, requiring multiple skin grafts!"" 

The same as the first!!!

Somehow, I managed to get her age, weight, height, a first name and an location of the 'injury event',  from 'his' attorney. 

I considered this 'shit' for a few more seconds with 'my guys' attorney and abruptly ended the call. 

His attorney sends me three walls of text apologizing and can we speak at a latter date....

Give myself 48 hours to process this information and plenty of time for my 'guy' to do or say something.

He denies. He lies. He orchestrates some BS about her and then lambasts me!!! He then goes on to say, what a ""good guy he was being"", how only ""good guys finish last"" and how they met there 'casually'...

I bit harder!

Made myself a couple trips over and learned plenty!

I found this woman. 

She was severely injured; required numerous skin grafts; was laid up for three months recovering; lost her job.

The other 'girl' had insurance, ( or so I was told...)  but her injuries and recovery much the same.

Both of them are scared for life!

TLDNR: The man I met is an 'ultimate COWARD POS!!!!' His pathology of denial, subterfuge, wounded me on the surface; his actions took flesh from two innocent women! 

I found the second woman and hope my efforts will help her recover some of her devastating financial/medical/job loss.


EDIT/UPDATE: Sorry it took so long!

Want to thank each of you for helping me! All of you let me see, that I needed to regroup!

Both of the women got on the back of his motorcycle and sustained 3rd degree burns on their backsides. They were burnt from the inside out. The first girl was a young 20ish college friend of his daughter, (he hid this from me as well). The second was a 39 year old that he met on face book (he lied about that...) both incidents happened within a months time.

There is/was some kind of mechanical failure on his bike. However, I had sat the back of his bike for hundreds of miles, on multiple trips and never got physically burnt or injured.  Each of these gals outweigh me by 50/60 lbs and so, they would 'fit' the bike in a way that their butts would extend off the seat and out over the fender. The screw that holds the seat in place is tapped thru the rear fender. The screw was making contact with the tire and sent an 'static charge' up to their moist butts/a rivet in their jeans and literally burnt them from the inside out. There were no burn marks on their jeans!

The second girl had no idea he was 'dating/seeing' someone and was innocent; I did what I could to help. She was grateful for the information/assistance. When she informed me she could go no further, legally and was moving forward, I wished her the best.

He hid his assets. His boss changed his hire 'status' as ""self-employed/contractor"". He didn't carry insurance for passengers. (The minimum in our state is 25,000 and it's not mandatory. I discovered very few motorcyclists pay for coverage of passengers in our state).

I did some 'sleuth' work to find her and in the process, made it clear to the POS that he messed with the wrong woman! 

Thanks reddit!
