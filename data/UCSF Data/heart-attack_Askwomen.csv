"Women who have survived a heart attack, what was it like?","It was scary.  I actually had a series of four to five in 24 hours.  I  had never had any previous cardiac issues.  I was only 43 at the time, and I quite suddenly became nauseous and sweaty while showering.  I tried to finish up my shower and couldn’t.  I collapsed into my bed soaking wet and starting experiencing pain under my left breast, wrapping around my side to the back, my left shoulder up the left side of my neck.  I was shaking and my heart rate was high (I was able to have my son grab a pulse oximeter).  My poor teenage boys had to call an ambulance, and they were literally going to send me home from the ER because all the tests were coming back fine.  The only thing that caught it was my troponin levels increased-that’s how they knew heart damage had occurred.  It was labeled NSTEMI.  We never did find the cause-it wasn’t due to a blockage, so the doctors attributed it to an arrhythmia.  They haven’t found the arrhythmia problem to this day, I’m not on any blood thinners, and the cardiac doctors have given me a clean bill of health.  I still get concerned whenever I start getting hot/sweaty/nauseous at all, since I would have never expected those to be associated with having a heart attack, especially in my forties.  I hope this answers your question.",748,gcp1b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/gcp1b8/women_who_have_survived_a_heart_attack_what_was/,101,1588533998.0,,2020-05-03 15:26:38
"Women who have survived a heart attack, what was it like?","OMD totally scary 

I was on campus when it happened.  Buying breakfast before class, when suddenly I had a hard time breathing.  It was like the air was too warm to breathe.  I collected my breakfast, put it in my bag and quickly took my stuff to the first aid room.  I then collapsed on the floor, took my jacket, scarf, hoodie and hat off, and security called for first aid.  They called the ambulance who thought it was either asthma, acid reflux, anxiety, or an allergic reaction.  We decided to go to the hospital.  They took an EKG and said something isn't right.  Immediately to the trauma bay and this point onwards is a bit of a blur in my memory.  But they transferred me to another hospital.  They took me to the Cath Lab and put a stent in my artery via my wrist.  It was incredibly painful.  There was also something heavy on my chest. The pain from the heart attack combined with whatever heavy item was on my chest, made me feel really nauseous and unwell.  After surgery, I was in the hospital for 6 days.  I couldn't move my wrist for 24 hours, and an IV line was put in my other arm, so I couldn't move that either.  My parents had to help me with meals because of both arms being immovable.  I also hadn't eaten since the night before because my breakfast was still in my bag.  I was the youngest on the ward.  This was 2 months ago.  And I am still learning how to deal with it day by day.  I have 5 new meds to take.  I gotta check my weight everyday, and my blood pressure, and heart rate have to be monitored.  I got a Fitbit to monitor my heart rate since the clinics are closed.  I have since been diagnosed with a condition called SCAD which is the cause of my heart attack.",748,gcp1b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/gcp1b8/women_who_have_survived_a_heart_attack_what_was/,101,1588533998.0,,2020-05-03 15:26:38
"Women who have survived a heart attack, what was it like?","I had my first one at 18 years old. My entire left side went numb, I became extremely dizzy, disoriented, cold sweats and nauseated. I went to the hospital and was told my troponin levels were elevated and I likely experienced a ""heart related event."" I was never told it was a 'heart attack' but it was more likely a 'transient ischemic attack.' In any case, both of those events are centered around the inability to get oxygen normally to a part of the body (brain/heart/lungs) due to a clot or other vascular issue. I was given no meds, not asked to stay for observation, nothing.

The wildest thing to me is that at that time, it was well-known that I was having issues with my energy/tiredness due to my heart condition. I had surgery as a baby and needed surgery less than a year after this even to close an atrial septal defect in the middle of the atria of my heart that had gotten to be 15 mm wide.

I do not think women are taken as seriously as men when it comes to heart attacks. Men have symptoms that are more ""textbook"" while women definitely do not. But when your heart is fucking up, boy can you tell. Whether you're a man or a woman. I have since learned to advocated for my own health - its easy to do when you have a chronic heart condition from birth.",748,gcp1b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/gcp1b8/women_who_have_survived_a_heart_attack_what_was/,101,1588533998.0,,2020-05-03 15:26:38
"Women who have survived a heart attack, what was it like?","I had one 9 months ago, aged 38. I had terrible heartburn for days before it, at first my chest felt tight, and i felt nauseous and clammy, and almost as if i had something stuck in my throat.

"Women who have survived a heart attack, what was it like?","I think it is important for women to share symptoms because they are often atypical. I never experienced any pain but woke up feeling incredibly dizzy with an extremely cold feeling inside my chest. Lots of heart issues in my family so I called for an ambulance at 6:30 a.m. By 10:00 I was in open heart surgery for a quadruple bypass. Apparently I had a heart attack on the table but because they had already started I survived. Had I been at home at the time I probably would not have made it to the hospital.

"Women who have survived a heart attack, what was it like?","I don't know. I didn't realize that I had one until having tests done afterwards that showed there was damage from it.

"Women who have survived a heart attack, what was it like?","I was 32, a Kindergarten teacher. It was 1995. I’d been taking a triptan drug for migraine headaches for a couple of years. This one particular occasion, a few hours after I took the tablet, I began to feel terrible pressure in my chest and up into the left side of my jaw. I honestly thought it was indigestion at first and chewed some antacid tablets. The pressure and feeling of panic grew. I called my parents. They got me and drove me to the local ER. 

It was set up with a “triage” nurse at a desk where you came in. The nurse wrote down your symptoms and sent your name to the back. You were told to go to the waiting area and wait until a nurse came out and called your name. 

So, I went to the desk and said I was having chest pains and was starting to feel nauseated. The nurse looked at me and said, “Well, you’re not having a heart attack. Go sit over there and wait for someone to call you.” We sat down. I remember that I started sweating and I was moaning as the pain in my chest intensified. It was very crowded, children crying, noise, smells...we’d been waiting over an hour when I found myself suddenly on my hands and knees puking on some random guy’s foot. 

Just at that moment one of the ER nurses came out from the treatment area to call the next patient and saw me. Turns out she was the mother of one of my students. She rushed me to the back, heard the words “chest pain” and had the doctor, an IV, nitro, EKG all inside 15 minutes. 

I was in the ICU for 2 days, had a cardiac cath, and stress test. It was determined that I had no blockage or other cardiac disease. However, the triptan migraine drug had caused me to have spasms in my coronary artery. They were severe enough to cause a myocardial infarction that left me with moderate heart damage.",748,gcp1b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/gcp1b8/women_who_have_survived_a_heart_attack_what_was/,101,1588533998.0,,2020-05-03 15:26:38
"Women who have survived a heart attack, what was it like?","Not me, but my mother. A few weeks ago, my mother decided to go out and hang out with her friend. That night, I was surprised that I didn't get a goodnight text or any of the sort as she would always either call me or text me. I thought nothing of it as she probably fell asleep. The next morning, I noticed how my mother wasn't home. Once again, I thought nothing of it and that she probably wanted to spend more time with her friend. 

The next day, I was starting to get worried until she called me. She said that she was in the hospital, and that she ended up getting a heart attack. I gave my step father the phone as she wanted to talk to him, and he didn't even believe her. He truly didn't believe that my mother was in the hospital and just passed it off as ""trying to start an argument."" It took nearly an hour for him to realize that my mother was serious as he could hear one of the machines through the phone. I had to stay away from my step father that weekend as I would have cursed him out for that. 

Two days later, we picked my mother up from the hospital, and we learned that she was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. During the time at home, she always said how her shoulder hurts, and I had to massage it time to time. She also had many dark bruises on her arms. A few weeks later she is doing fine. Her shoulder still hurts but it's getting better. I'm just happy that she's here with me.

"Women who have survived a heart attack, what was it like?","My mum had a heart attack at 51.  She had struggled with heart burn for years anyway, so when she had those feelings she wasn’t too concerned.  She woke up in the night and was vomiting and my dad went to help her.  He said that she went all floppy and clammy and very pale.  My dad was in the army for 24 years and he’s had some medical training so he guessed she was having a heart attack and called 999 immediately.  My mum didn’t even want him to call the ambulance because she didn’t think it could be that serious. 

When they arrived they did tests and said that she had had a heart attack.  She was denying it even to the paramedics! I don’t know the exact details of it but she had a blockage and they removed it by going through her vein and into her artery (again, I don’t know the exact details).  She had smoked since she was 15 so she quit straight away and cleaned up her diet, as well as going on several medications.  4 years later and she’s fine! She was also diagnosed as pre-diabetic but she’s managed to control that.

I wasn’t actually there for any of this because this took place during my first year at uni.  But yeah, even my mum, in the midst of a heart attack, was denying that she was having a heart attack.  Medical advice is so clearly aimed at men, and it could have cost my mum her life if my dad hadn’t been there and acted on his instinct and knowledge.",748,gcp1b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/gcp1b8/women_who_have_survived_a_heart_attack_what_was/,101,1588533998.0,,2020-05-03 15:26:38

"Women that have had heart attacks, what were your symptoms and how long did it take you to find help?","I had a heart attack at 28 caused by coronary artery spasm (prinzmetal’s angina). 
I had been feeling pretty bad on and off for 2 days, short of breath, felt exhausted, ‘tired’ feeling in my upper chest and left arm/shoulder. Like the muscle fatigue you feel if you’ve been using your arms above your head for too long. And lots palpitations. I was fine one minute and felt like I had been running a marathon the next, over and over.
Went to the GP twice those 2 days, but I was diagnosed with an anxiety attack and told I was hyperventilating. The evening of the second day it got worse, I was so very tired and my arm felt heavy, and I started getting nauseous. I was watching a movie with my BF, and at one point I told him I was feeling really bad and was going to bed. I got up from the couch, walked 3 steps and collapsed. He dialed the emergency services (I did wake up pretty soon and was able to walk back to the couch before they arrived), and when they arrived and hooked me up to a monitor I was told I was having a heart attack. 

I had no significant pain, more like a dull ache and tiredness, like muscle fatigue, left arm/shoulder and upper chest. The exhaustion was the worst, and I couldn’t walk two steps without getting winded and my heart beating out of my chest. And I knew something was VERY wrong.

I recovered fast and with no lasting damage by the way, and with medication it has not happened again. I was in good physical condition, and still am, and because I seemed fit, healthy and young the GP didn’t think it was something serious.",7,g467dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/g467dp/women_that_have_had_heart_attacks_what_were_your/,3,1587324679.0,,2020-04-19 15:31:19

She said it never felt painful or sharp, and it didn't feel sudden like in movies.

"for those who have had a heart attack, what was the experience like?","I haven't had a heart attack, but since these stories are being shared I wanted to note the difference between cardiac arrest and a heart attack. My father had a heart attack without going into arrest and somehow this wasn't communicated to my brother or me so we didn't fully grasp what was happening, and I've since heard many people dismiss their symptoms because they don't match a movie scenario.

Below is an abbreviated version from the [American Heart Association](http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks/heart-attack-or-sudden-cardiac-arrest-how-are-they-different), but they have the full signs and symptoms of a heart attack or stroke on their website. As well as info on Hands-Only CPR. Hopefully okay to share here.

""People often use these terms interchangeably, but they are not synonyms. A heart attack is when blood flow to the heart is blocked, and sudden cardiac arrest is when the heart malfunctions and suddenly stops beating unexpectedly. A heart attack is a “circulation” problem and sudden cardiac arrest is an “electrical” problem.
 
Symptoms of a heart attack may be immediate and intense. More often, though, symptoms start slowly and persist for hours, days or weeks before a heart attack. Unlike with sudden cardiac arrest, the heart usually does not stop beating during a heart attack. The heart attack symptoms in women can be different than men.

Sudden cardiac arrest occurs suddenly and often without warning. It is triggered by an electrical malfunction in the heart that causes an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). With its pumping action disrupted, the heart cannot pump blood to the brain, lungs and other organs. Seconds later, a person loses consciousness and has no pulse. Death occurs within minutes if the victim does not receive treatment.""

"for those who have had a heart attack, what was the experience like?","I have not had a heart attack but I am a nurse who works in a hospital unit that deals with them on a regular basis :)

Just for clarification, as another Redditor pointed out, a ""heart attack"" is a term commonly applied to two different scenarios: a blockage in a coronary artery that causes heart muscle damage (myocardial infarction) OR when the heart isn't pumping blood properly and essentially stops (cardiac arrest), causing a person to essentially die unless someone helps (I.e. CPR +/- defibrillation). However, the two aren't necessarily exclusive - a myocardial infarction *can* cause a cardiac arrest if left untreated (though cardiac arrests aren't always caused by myocardial infarctions, and there are different types of cardiac arrests.....yeah, it's complicated lol).

So for this post, I'm going to assume ""heart attack"" to mean myocardial infarction, which is more common but harder to diagnose (because let's be real, if you go into cardiac arrest, you die, and that's not hard to miss).

The classic symptoms of a myocardial infarction are:

* Chest pain or pressure (often described as squeezing, like a band over the chest, or ""like an elephant sitting on the chest"")
* Pain radiating to the left arm and/or jaw
* Shortness of breath
* Nausea +/- vomiting
* Sweating
* Just generally feeling that something is very wrong

However, I've also seen lots of people say they had vague symptoms.

Most common of the subtle symptoms is the feeling of indigestion or heartburn. I can't count the amount of times I've heard the story of ""ate a big meal, went to bed, woke up with indigestion, took an antacid, and still felt like shit, continued to take antacids, and when I felt really unwell, went to the hospital."" The general rule of thumb I like to stick to is, if you're having heartburn and it won't go away with heartburn treatment, see a doctor. Even if it's ""just"" heartburn, you'll want to get it treated, anyway, because if left uncontrolled, it can damage your esophagus.

Other vague symptoms would be things like back pain, arm pain, nausea, intense fatigue, and dizziness. In fact, a couple of times, I've had patients who had no symptoms at all until we ran some tests on them; this is most common in people with diabetes.

While women are more likely to have the non-traditional signs and symptoms, men can have them, too, just like women can also have the classic signs. In fact, my first patient with a silent heart attack (no signs or symptoms) was a man!

So yeah, it's not very cut and dry but if you are ever concerned, please just call 911 (or whatever number you call for an ambulance) and get yourself to a hospital. Even if it turns out to be nothing, don't feel embarrassed or feel like you've wasted our time. We always take potential cardiac symptoms seriously because it's hard for us to tell, too, based on signs and symptoms alone, and the tests are fairly easy and quick. And  like a lot of other major ailments, it's best to get treated early rather than let it go on and on, potentially causing major damage.

Lastly, because I always get messaged, *please* no one ask me medical questions about you or a specific person. I cannot make assessments and give advice over the internet. If you have concerns about yourself or a loved one, please see a doctor in person.",63,9tdzct,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/9tdzct/for_those_who_have_had_a_heart_attack_what_was/,14,1541138421.0,,2018-11-02 02:00:21
"for those who have had a heart attack, what was the experience like?","My mom had one last year and said it wasn't what men are known to experience at all. She had gone to bed and felt uneasy, said her heart started to ""smash and bang"" and generally felt anxious and unwell. She said she just knew something was wrong and suspected a heart attack, as they run in the family (she was the fourth of her siblings to have one within a three-year span) and my grandmother had died of one when I was a baby. My dad drove her to the hospital and it was confirmed she had a ""mild, non-stemi"" heart attack.

"For those of you who have had a heart attack, or someone you know, what were the symptoms?","Not me, but I'm a nurse who works frequently with heart attack patients (for simplicity, I'm calling them heart attacks, when I mean ""myocardial infarctions"" - a blockage in one or more coronary arteries, causing heart muscle damage due to a lack of oxygen supplied by blood). The symptoms range from the very typical to really odd ones. I'd say the most common symptoms are pretty typical - a lot of chest pain (usually described as a ""heaviness"" like an elephant on the chest or a ""crushing"" or ""squeezing"", but people can have all sorts of different pains), often accompanied with symptoms like shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, and/or just generally feeling unwell and that something ""just isn't right"". Sometimes, the pain radiates to the jaw, the left arm, and/or the back, but I actually find it's less common than simply chest pain.

The most common vague symptom is definitely heartburn. Heartburn can mimic heart attacks and vice versa. I've seen people who thought they were having heartburn for days on end, when actually, they were having a heart attack (because it's not like on TV, where people suddenly clutch at their chests and keel over; such cases are usually the people who go into arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, which *can* be caused by heart attacks but not always). Usually, the key difference is the presence of other symptoms described above, but as I said, they're not always present. This is one of the reasons why it's important to get heartburn checked out if it doesn't respond to over-the-counter medications (the other side to it is that heartburn can actually do damage to your esophagus over time, so it's best to nip that in the bud in its early stages).

Lastly, I hope I don't scare anyone here, but there is also such a thing as ""silent heart attacks"", where a person is having a heart attack but there aren't any symptoms. It's more common in those with diabetes and the elderly. I once had a patient who was in hospital for a gangrenous toe (don't get diabetes, folks), and one morning, he was awake early and reading the newspaper, so I did a set of vital signs on him. To my surprise, his pulse was in the 140's (for reference, normal rate is 60-100, though we start to get worried around the 110-120 range). Called the doctor, who ordered some tests. The patient was totally calm, no pain or breathing difficulties (except for his sore toe). Turns out he was having a heart attack! He was treated for it and did fine, but sometimes I wonder what would have happened if he were sitting at home rather than in the hospital.

(**EDIT:** I am getting a few questions about the heart rate thing. I should add that heart rate alone is *not* an indicator of anything. It has to be taken in context. *Lots* of things can cause a high heart rate, from benign causes like anxiety or too much caffeine to more concerning things like a serious heart condition. One must take into consideration things like other vital signs, signs and symptoms, the patient's history, etc., to get even a decent clinical picture of what's going on. If a high heart rate can be explained, then it's not as big of a deal, either. For example, if a person is in respiratory distress, then they will have a heart rate because, well, they're struggling to breathe. As soon as you fix the respiratory issues, the heart rate should come down nicely. Also, the 110-120 range is still referring to a *resting* heart rate, and don't forget that I work in a hospital, often with patients who have co-morbidities that affect the heart's health and/or are elderly, who typically have lots of co-morbidities anyway. A young, healthy person may be able to tolerate a resting heart rate in the 110-120 range if, say, they get sick. An elderly person who has diabetes and heart disease? Yeah, not so much. A person who has just had a heart attack? Same. Their hearts just aren't able to work as hard as a young, healthy person's for prolonged periods of time. If you're young, healthy, and not sick or anxious or anything like that and your *resting* heart rate is elevated, then I wouldn't say it's a cause to panic, but you may want to get checked out by your family doctor - could be anything from anxiety to a malfunctioning thyroid to an actual problem with your heart. Again, go with your gut. If something feels *wrong* to you and you're that concerned about it, then talk to a doctor. I can't diagnose anything over the Internet...plus, I'm a nurse so I don't diagnose things in general!)

On the flip side, you can also have all the symptoms of a heart attack and even had things like electrocardiogram changes that suggest a heart attack, but in actuality, your coronary arteries don't have any blockages! (i.e. not a heart attack) An example would be [Takotsubo cardiomyopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takotsubo_cardiomyopathy) (a.k.a. Broken Heart Syndrome). I've looked after two patients with this diagnosis and it's really bizarre. Basically, the heart muscle will be injured, often due to stress (hence the name Broken Heart Syndrome - it's been known to happen after a person has lost a loved one), so we'll often see changes in the ECG, troponin level rise in the blood (often used to determine severity of a heart attack), and even indicators of heart failure. However, when an angiogram is done, there aren't any coronary artery blockages. The good news is that people generally do well after this, so long as they take care of themselves.

So basically, the heart is a very complicated organ and there is no real way to tell if there's something seriously wrong with it or not based on symptoms alone. As well, pain in the chest can be caused by so many different things, from anxiety to costocondritis to pulmonary emboli to heart attacks. Basically, if you have a concern about it, go see a doctor. Go with your gut and don't ignore symptoms that won't go away.

**LAST EDIT:** I'm getting lots of people asking me about their specific situations. As per Reddit policy (and because it's uncomfortable for me), I won't be giving medical advice to *anyone*. I can't evaluate anyone over the Internet. I'd merely be taking wild guesses, which isn't safe. If you have an actual concern about your health, please see a professional in real life, who can discuss things with you and do an examination.",101,4lrq68,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/4lrq68/for_those_of_you_who_have_had_a_heart_attack_or/,58,1464672526.0,"I've heard women can have the classic symptoms such as chest pain or arm pain.

Another time a family friend called me because she was just feeling a sense of doom and heaviness, like an elephant was sitting on her.

"For those of you who have had a heart attack, or someone you know, what were the symptoms?","This is an awesome question! Women have definitely been seen to have much different symptoms from men and it's so important to know about how cardiac episodes can present themselves for women vs. men.  Heart disease might not be the most popular or talked about cause, but heart disease and strokes are the cause of death of one out of every three women. 

I've been involved with the American Heart Association for years and they have a TON of resources but below are some pointers. Overall, all the survivors I've heard speak over the years typically say they experienced headaches and ""heaviness,"" but not the traditional arm tingling and crushing chest pain. It was much more subtle. 

Lastly, one of the big things we always try to hit home is it is so often that women are the last to raise their hand and recognize something is really wrong with them. We put others in front of us and think that it will just pass. One women told me she went the whole day, getting her sons to school, cooking dinner for her family, while she was suffering from a severe cardiac episode. She just didn't think it was serious enough to bother anyone with until she collapsed. 

**Signs of a Heart Attack**

- Uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain in the center of your chest. It lasts more than a few minutes, or goes away and comes back.

- Pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach.

- Shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort.

- Other signs such as breaking out in cold sweat, nausea or lightheadedness.

- Women are somewhat more likely than men to experience some of the other common symptoms, particular shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting and back or jaw pain.

**Signs of Stroke and TIAs (transient ischemic attack)**

- Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body.

- Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding.

- Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes.

- Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination.- Sudden severe headache with no known cause.",101,4lrq68,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/4lrq68/for_those_of_you_who_have_had_a_heart_attack_or/,58,1464672526.0,"I've heard women can have the classic symptoms such as chest pain or arm pain.

"Women that have had heart attacks, cancer, or other major medical problems--what were your symptoms and how were you diagnosed?","I've seen a lot of women having heart attacks and they have all displayed the typical ""classic"" heart attack signs and symptoms.

There is always the possibility of having an atypical presentation though, such as nausea which won't go away, ""not feeling right"", and abnormal weakness/fatigue.  These types of symptoms are more common in the elderly/diabetic community. 

If you have a strong history of heart disease in your family, you can ask your primary care doctor to refer you to a cardiologist so you can get a cardiac stress test (walking/running on a treadmill hooked up to an EKG).

>Some digestive diseases, including Crohn's disease, affect more women than men. Up to six times more women than men have irritable bowel syndrome, a collection of symptoms that affect the large intestine. Women are likelier to have gallstones, due to the effects of progesterone and estrogen. For various reasons, women are likelier than men to use aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), and so are likelier to experience their harmful side-effects.


>With some exceptions, autoimmune diseases tend to affect one sex more than the other; specifically, far more women than men. For some time, physicians and researchers have been asking why this is so. The most popular theory to date has been that female hormones set the stage for diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis. 


>Graves Disease

>Recent studies put the incidence of Graves' disease at one to two cases per 1,000 population per year in England. It occurs much more frequently in women than in men. The disease frequently presents itself during early adolescence or begins gradually in adult women, often after childbirth, and is progressive until treatment. It has a powerful hereditary component.[3] Graves' disease tends to be more severe in men, even though it is rarer. It appears less likely to go into permanent remission and the eye disease tends to be more severe, but men are less likely to have large goitres.[65] In a statistical study of symptoms and signs of 184 thyrotoxic patients (52 men, 132 women), the male patients were somewhat older than the females, and cases were more severe among men than among women. Cardiac symptoms were more common in women, even though the men were older and more often had a severe form of the disease; palpitations and dyspnea were more common and severe in women.[3]

Do any of you get panic attacks?,"I've lived with them for decades. I'm not sure there is a ""why""; some people just get them while others don't, like hives or a stutter. 

One of the best bits of advice I ever got came from a therapist who used cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to help me with the attacks: Once they start, you can ease the symptoms, but the chemical cocktail that creates that sensation of panic takes some time to metabolize out of your bloodstream. Just thinking of it as a purely physical phenomenon -- just like sweating during exercise or getting itchy eyes after dusting -- really helped a lot. 

Thinking of them in milder terms has also made a big difference: not ""this is unbearable"" but ""this is unpleasant,"" not ""I can't stand this"" to ""this will end soon and I'll just breathe my way through it until then."" Catastrophizing the attacks, I've found, really ramps them up in intensity. I no longer think of a long-lasting, intense attack as ""the worst"" or ""so bad"" but as...well, long-lasting and intense. Using those less emotionally charged words to describe the episode helps me step back from feeling the panic and more toward observing it, if that makes sense. 

I still get panic attacks, and they aren't ever fun, but they've become far more manageable by seeing them as a physical symptom of a weird little quirk of my brain chemistry. Other things that help: 

- Focusing on my breathing
- Playing some inconsequential word game in my head
- A change of scenery during the attack
- Recalling past attacks and realizing I didn't have a heart attack during any of those episodes either

Do any of you get panic attacks?,"I used to get them several times daily, now only once or twice a month. It very much feels like a heart attack, or just ""impending doom/death"" in general. The best thing for me is acknowledging and accepting the panic attack, trying to fight it just makes it worse. And distraction and deep breaths also. During a panic attack we tend to hyperventilate which in turn worsens symptoms like pounding heart, rapid pulse and shortness of breath. It's a vicious cycle.

Do any of you get panic attacks?,"When I started suffering from panic attacks in my early 20s I literally thought I was going to have a heart attack and die. Went to the hospital a few times because I believed I was dying in fact. I read this book and a few like it and found educating myself about the symptoms to be an important first step in realizing I could take back control of my body. Like some have already said, breathing deeply and slowly is helpful to me, knowing that by slowing my breathing mindfully I am also slowing my heart rate naturally. Give it a few minutes of focusing on breathing slowly and nothing else and then check in with yourself to see how you feel. I haven't had a real panic attack in 5+ years and seldom even feel high anxiety. Good luck to you!

Do any of you get panic attacks?,"I get them and I have found this breathing exercise to help a lot.  Breathe in through your nose slowly for a count of ten and hold it for a count of ten.  Then out your mouth slowly for a count of ten.  Do this several times.  When I do this, I can actually feel my heart rate decreasing while I hold my breath.  The counting also can help distract you from runaway thoughts so it can be very calming during times of stress and anxiety even when you aren't having a panic attack.",55,2ozrru,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/2ozrru/do_any_of_you_get_panic_attacks/,62,1418350270.0,"Lately I've been getting them, and I feel like I'm going to get a heart attack.

Do any of you get panic attacks?,"I used to get them a couple times a day, now I can remember 1 in the last year.

1. Breathe. If you can calm down your body, your mind will follow. There are several different breathing exercises you can look up online.
2. If there's a trigger, distance yourself from it if possible. Avoidance isn't usually good, but if you're being triggered by something it does no good to helplessly stay around it. You can deal with it later. 
3. Talk yourself through it. You've been through this before, you can get through it now. This is an overreaction on your body's part. You're not going to die. People don't die from panic attacks. 
4. Distract yourself. Watch a tv show you like, call a friend, go for a run, do something to take your mind off it. 
5. Consider therapy, if you're not already in it. A trained therapist can walk you through all of the coping mechanism for the panic attacks, and help you prevent them from happening.

another thing i do is focus on something else, like something that is actually real as opposed to the fear. other times, i've had panic attacks so dizzying i've almost fainted (and i fainted for the first time due to one last month), so the best bet is usually to sit yourself down, try to put your head between your legs, breathe, and try to take yourself out of the situation if you can.

Do any of you get panic attacks?,"All you have to do is notice what is happening but don't attach any emotion to it, the same way you might notice what colour the car is across the street. 

Acknowledge that your heart is beating quickly, you know you can't die from it beating fast (after all you have had panic attacks before and you are still here) the heart is an amazingly strong and resilient organ. Also, I bet you couldn't make your heart beat faster even if you tried to.

Don't fight what is happening - that is the worst thing you can do, don't be impatient or try to force anything. Just accept it, think like you are floating above it, as though it wasn't really happening to you and let time pass. Before you know it the symptoms will have gone. That is the only way to break the anxiety > negative thoughts > adrenalin > increased anxiety cycle and it will help prevent it happening again in the first place.

Do any of you get panic attacks?,"Yes, though luckily I don't tend to suffer other symptoms of GAD outside of them. I just get attacks, and they're almost always latent: that is to say, they occur *after* what triggered them has ended.

I once went to the ER because I didn't know what was happening to me was a panic attack and my doctor ordered me to go. The ER doctor dismissed me as intentionally altering my heart rate :/

I take hydroxyzine as needed if they're big ones, and it works instantly, which is awesome, but it also causes extreme drowsiness, which sucks. It's a lot better than the panic attack, but it still takes me out of play for a bit. It's non habit forming and there are no other side effects I've experienced though so compared to any other medication I've ever taken (besides rescue inhalers) it's an amazing medicine.

As for advice? Call your doctor. I get my medicine straight from my primary care physician.

ETA: Though I say I don't really experience other symptoms of GAD, I AM a worrywart, but it doesn't interfere with my day-to-day (beyond maybe annoying others by venting my worries aloud) so I don't really qualify that. My anxiety doesn't really prevent me from getting things done (my perfectionism, on the other hand, often slows me down).",55,2ozrru,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/2ozrru/do_any_of_you_get_panic_attacks/,62,1418350270.0,"Lately I've been getting them, and I feel like I'm going to get a heart attack.

Panic attacks immediately reduced. I was smoking too much weed. Stopped smoking weed for a few months. Even less panic attacks. From there it was mostly just accepting the panic attacks and finding out what helped. I still keep a pack of cigarettes around because what helps me most is to take a walk and have a cigarette.

Do any of you get panic attacks?,"I have various methods for different kind of freak outs. My savior is a book called ""The Portable Therapist"". I like to take long showers (not bathe) in hot water, cry & let out all my tears then collect myself and my thoughts (all done in the shower). I go to my very calm & optimistic best friend who will tell me a pointless funny joke, bcs tbh, it distracts me by a ton & actually helps calm me down. Another is going to my father, bcs parental guidance makes me feel safe. If I'm in a safe mind set to drive, going to a park & sitting in silence enjoying nature is also one of my favorite happy places.
I used to just go to sleep and shut out the world but please do not sweep your feelings under a rug & suppress your feelings. 
Be sure to have multiple available methods, bcs I once hyperventilated so badly to the point of over stretching my rib cartilage & inflaming my chest wall muscles & I actually took myself to the hospital (I hate hospitals bcs...) just to sit there for about 5 hours for them to tell me that it's hard to figure out what's wrong with me bcs I have depression & anxiety and bcs I have unknown & a wide amount of emotional triggers.

Do any of you get panic attacks?,"I've had maybe 3, the most recent being last night. I haven't been too well recently and had to go to the A&E. I'd just had a philosophy lesson, so I'd walked from the University to the hospital (2 min walk).
I waited the obligatory 2 hours and was finally seen by the nurse and then the doctor. I was then in another waiting room, where I'd really begun to feel unwell. So I rang my mum, asking her if she could come up to the hospital and wait with me, she said she was on her way and I started crying.

This was a rather packed waiting room and I started crying quite heavily and I could hear the couple next to me, talking about how I was crying.
I'm not quite sure how it happened, but my breathing started to get rather rapid and I ended up having a panic attack that lasted about 6 mins.

It was absolute hell, because there was nothing wrong with me in terms if oxygen levels (mine was 100), but I still couldn't calm myself. The doctor was ever so nice and took my hand and calmed me down, by just talking to me as a regular person, so I could understand that I was fine and I wasn't going to die. 

I don't think I'm very qualified to give you advice, but when the doctor spoke to me normally, I didn't feel as if anything was going to happen and it did calm me down a fair bit. It helps a lot if you were to talk to some close friends perhaps and explain to them that if it were to occur whilst you were with them, to just talk to you normally and not panic as the pat would further induce a sense of panic, for yourself.

Do any of you get panic attacks?,"I've gotten a couple, but they've never been too bad (luckily).  Deep breaths are really a good start, they're cliche for a reason.  I tell myself things like ""This is a panic attack.  Nothing is wrong with you, you're just freaking out,"" because they can be scary and make me think that there is physically something wrong.  Reminding yourself that you're not dying, you're just panicking, is good.  Trying to concentrate on something that isn't the source of your panic helps.

Do any of you get panic attacks?,"I get them very occasionally, some now. For me, the worst part is the feeling like ""I am going to die from my heart right this second.""

Now what's prevented them is quitting caffeine. This isn't the case for everyone, so I'm not trying to be like ""everyone ought to quit caffeine"" or whatever.

Nutrition! I don't know what this free online course will be like but it's free :) https://www.coursera.org/course/lifenutr

One of my fav fun facts: Your body uses cholesterol to make bile (among other things), bile helps you digest fats, once your digested food and bile enter your intestines your body can absorb and recycle the bile for future use - BUT - if you eat a lot of fiber it get's trapped in you stool and gets eliminated. Then your gall bladder demands more cholesterol from your body and obtains it from your blood serum. Then blood serum levels of cholesterol go down. This is how eating OLD FASHIONED oats helps you reduce your cholesterol.

"Ladies of Askwomen, what are some basic things every woman should know about the human body and general health?","The average hymen was never a wall-like barrier. It's more like a ring of folded tissue around the edges of the vagina, and it stretches and wears down over time. If it was actually a barrier, your period couldn't get out of you - a condition known as an ""imperforate hymen"" that usually needs to be corrected by a gynecologist. Bleeding during sex is not a normal consequence of losing your virginity! If you are bleeding during sex, it is probably because you aren't relaxed and lubricated enough, or your partner is being too rough, or both.

Always pee/wipe yourself downstairs if you have PiV sex, I've gotten urinary tract infections and thrush that way (basically, if your fanny isn't making it, you want it out there pretty quick). 


If you're getting anal sex, then don't go from the ass to the fanny without washing it.


You can get condoms/dental dams super cheap online, it makes it easier to get a variety of sizes.


There's more than just the pill for birth control.


And maybe explain what thrush is, and the symptoms. I had it, and freaked the fuck out thinking it was an STI, and how I was gonna tell the SO that he'd given me it.

"Ladies of Askwomen, what are some basic things every woman should know about the human body and general health?","Regardless of her current weight/fitness state, it's always good to have a general awareness of how many calories her body needs daily and how much she's actually giving it (and how much she's using through exercise). And reevaluate periodically. It changes every year as we age and it starts getting too easy to gain weight unknowingly. 

I don't want her or anyone to feel bad about their body or start to obsess over counting calories, i just wish i had understood this concept earlier. The more control i have over my own life & health, the better, right? 

The ""daily recommended calories"" on nutrition labels (2000 in US) is way too high for many women, it's such a generalized number, totally useless. There are calculators online that will give a better ballpark for your height, weight, age & sex. Most people, when they start tracking their eating habits, are ASTOUNDED at how much they were really eating without realizing it. (If i ate 2000c I'd gain a pound every 1.5wks)

Learning more about nutrition and what different nutrients do for your body is great, but there's a lot of misinformation and debate and we just don't know it all yet either.

"Ladies of Askwomen, what are some basic things every woman should know about the human body and general health?","I'm taking Health Ed to mean total body health education rather than sexual education. In that case my lessons are simple:

* Water: drink it, lots of it. Not only when you're thirsty but consistently throughout your day.
* Vitamin D: the stuff sunshine gives you is hard to get enough of. Take a supplement, it will make you feel more balanced.
* Exercise: Does not kill you, does make you stronger. Do it. Even if it is just a short walk every day.
* Carbohydrates: eat less of them, they make your body go slow motion. Stick to complex carbs and lean protein for more energy and better moods.

How do y'all decompress when stressful deadlines approach?,"Plan. I spent at least half my time just planning, sometimes a day or two in advance.    
Keep moving. Keep moving through the projects. Recognize that sleep is necessary for successful completion of projects. Eat. Crank it out. You have one more hour's worth of work in ya. Keep going and you are one step closer to finishing.   
Then step away for a few hours completely. Change gears. Watch a movie. Read a book. Recognize that grinding through a project makes you blind to mistakes because you have been staring at it all day. Ideally, give yourself 24 hours away from said project.      
And then jump back in for the final check over. Read. Re-read. Read it out loud. Fix mistakes. and then call it done.   
By that point, I *know* I have done everything possible to make it good. It *is* possible to poke the thing to death so don't keep going back once it's done. Staple the sucker and step away.

But anyway, I logged into facebook this morning to see that yet another person I graduated with has passed away.

A few weeks before graduation a girl with cancer who had made her goal making it to graduation passed on.  The whole school was in mourning.  We all wore pins at graduation.

How many young people from your hometown/high school have passed away?,"We had a disproportionate number of people in my grade die from elementary school all the way through high school. In fifth grade, my friend's twin brother was killed in a hit-and-run. In seventh grade, a boy in my math class died in a snowmobile accident (this is why you don't let a child drive a snowmobile). A special needs student died freshman year of high school as well as a girl who committed suicide, and then the next year, my first best friend when I was really young died in her sleep from a seizure disorder. Another special needs student died right before high school graduation.

This was in a fairly small community, so it was very unusual that these deaths kept happening, all for different reasons. Personally, I'm glad that none of these (except for the suicide) was a result of drugs.

As far as discussing it with women, I think it would depend on the situation.

I'm confident from the first kiss, to the first dance and up to going home with them. But at the thought of anything sex related, my heart starts to pound.

I want to talk to them about it before I start, because I feel so disappointed by it.. I'm happy with the way I look and I enjoy talking with people.. but this is so embarrassing for me. I feel that it ruined possible relationships I could have had. 

Whenever I hook up with someone new I finish within the first few seconds. I just laugh about it before they do and pretend as if that hasn't happened before.. but it happens all the time. 

The only way I can last a decent amount of time is if I've been hooking up with them consistently for a long time or drunk (and I dont like to drink).

My question to you is how do I talk to someone about this. Whether it's our first time or someone I've been seeing for a while?

I want to talk to them about it before I start, because I feel so disappointed by it.. I'm happy with the way I look and I enjoy talking with people.. but this is so embarrassing for me. I feel that it ruined possible relationships I could have had. 

Whenever I hook up with someone new I finish within the first few seconds. I just laugh about it before they do and pretend as if that hasn't happened before.. but it happens all the time. 

The only way I can last a decent amount of time is if I've been hooking up with them consistently for a long time or drunk (and I dont like to drink).

My question to you is how do I talk to someone about this. Whether it's our first time or someone I've been seeing for a while?

"Full disclosure, or take the hint?","Move on. Full disclosure is always wrong because it sets you up for the same failure. You just need to realize it's not about you ""objectively"". Objectively you're a good guy and blah blah blah but that's not where relationships happen. You've become better objectively , now learn how to connect with people subjectively. ",4,10y4sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/10y4sb/full_disclosure_or_take_the_hint/,6,1349403217.0,"Hello /r/AskWomen, I would like your help on getting some perspective on my situation.
The long story of this goes as follows: I have always been a chubby kid, and I adapted to my situation by putting on a thick skin and trying to be funny. In high school I was bullied by some people I had considered friends, and of course they would make fun of me for being fat. I believe this contributed to me developing a rather negative self-image, which put a damper on my ability to show interest and pursue relationships with the ladyfolk. Consequently, I have never had a serious relationship or any type of sexual contact, and I am 23 now. That situation is not good, in fact I would say it is very bad.


I think I sort of went into a downward spiral when I moved away from home to go to college and my bad consumption habits had free reign. I was at a personal worst last December: no job, out of shape, very fat, ate nothing but fast food, smoked a lot of pot, played games all day, and I was doing the bare minimum for my classes. I felt really unhealthy and I eventually had to confront myself and make some changes to avert impeding bodily disasters like a heart attack or diabetes


A few months prior to hitting rock bottom I had become friends with a rather peculiar but very cool young lady through shared our shared interest in marijuana. I think getting some perspective on her life made me realize how, well… pathetic I felt. She was a much better student than I, working an internship, in good physical shape, and just seemed to have her life in order. Even though she was three years younger than me, she had far surpassed me in overall life excellence. I considered her a remarkable individual and I had an interest in pursuing a romantic relationship with her, but it was apparent to me that she was out of my league. On the 1-10 scale I estimated her to be a solid 8 and I was like a 4. With such a disparity of apparent worth it seemed it would be inappropriate and rude for me to make any non-platonic advances towards her. 


But still, I felt like we had really good mental chemistry and she was like everything I could want out of a romantic partner. We are both very logical, analytical, well read, cultured, sophisticated as fuck, sarcastic, slightly evil, and somewhat conceited. With these traits, I don’t think either of us often meet people we really click with. With a lot of people I feel like even when they are present I am mentally alone, and I believe she feels the same way.


Anyways, starting in January I made some changes, started eating healthier, started exercising, and really tried to grow as a person and cultivate a better life for myself. I have sworn off soda, snack foods, fast food, started running daily, working out at the gym, and just spending more time outside and less time on the internets. I have lost a lot of weight since then, I’ve dropped ~75lbs and gained some muscle mass. Friends and family frequently comment on how I’m looking great now, which is sort of uncomfortable for me but still very cool. I felt really unattractive before, but I like what I see in the mirror now. I would say my lady friend inspired me to strive for greater personal excellence, and I would like to tell her about this.


I would say I’ve been working on my body image as a means to work up the nerve to ask her out, so for me there has been a lot of build-up to this. About a week ago I got drunk while we were hanging out and I made a pass at her by saying something to the effect that I find her very cool and very attractive, and she reciprocated by saying she thinks I am pretty cool and she values our plutonic friendship. I am wondering if I should tell her just how deep my feelings go, and the effect she has had on me, or if I should take what seems to be a very clear social cue that she is not interested in me in that way and let it go. So I turn it over to you, /r/AskWomen, how would you respond if you were put into a similar situation?



TL;DR: Developed a crush on a friend, used that as motivation to lose weight and improve self-image. 75lbs of weight loss later I politely make a pass at her, and am politely turned down. Want to know if I should press further and let her know what’s up, or take the hint, let it go, and move on?

"Full disclosure, or take the hint?","My advice is to move on. You've sexed yourself up, you are a more attractive, more confident man than you were when you met her. You have tons of options. Go meet someone new, because damn man, you are never going to be surrounded by as many well-read, interesting, charming, hilarious women again in your life. College is a great place to meet people, so you should meet them. Go out on dates with them. This way you can still have your super cool friend, and also perhaps a super cool girlfriend, instead of having things with your friend be eternally weird and have a hit to your new found confidence. Besides, maybe after meeting more people and having more interaction with other women, this lady won't still be your dreamweaver, this is going to sound harsh, but maybe you're just super into her because she's a nice, attractive girl that wanted to be your friend.

A normal anxiety attack I can thwart beforehand or even during the attack itself, but I think the panic part of the panic attack makes it more severe. 

When I mentioned routines before I meant stuff like have I been eating enough during my day? Have I been exercising?

Have you ever had a panic attack? How did/do you deal with it?,"I had a really interesting session with a CBT therapist who went though every physical symptom of a panic attack that I experienced and explained biologically why my body was causing this to happen. It really helped to ground me because I realised my body is trying to help me rather than fight me and I think back to that conversation whenever I feel a panic attack coming on. He also told me that it can be useful to try and ask your body to do the opposite of what you want. For instance, when I have a panic attack my heart rate increases dramatically. He suggested rather than me thinking I need to slow my heart rate down (which tends to just make it beat even faster because I’m freaking myself out about why it’s so quick) to instead think “Go on then, speed up. Show me how fast you can go.” Incredibly, my heart rate then starts to decrease, because I’m not causing myself further panic about the physical aspects of the attack. It‘s obviously not going to work for everyone but this has really helped me so I’d advise looking into the physical manifestations of panic and seeing if it helps you to rationalise what your body is doing.",2,ijr0ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/ijr0ks/have_you_ever_had_a_panic_attack_how_diddo_you/,33,1598874803.0,Are there any useful tricks to make it less worse?,2020-08-31 07:53:23

Have you ever had a panic attack? How did/do you deal with it?,"When I am having panic attacks or their equivalent, usually in that situation that requires me to be focused, I tend to do really well and I am really resilient and stoic in stressful situations. I do over think alot and I would tend to take the worst possible outcome in an accident and make contingency plans but that doesn't mean I don't think I'm brilliant for it. The thing about me is I have instead very hypersensitive senses, and I basically just over register everything around me, bit like a cat. I have had a very calm childhood, and a really peaceful upbringing, so maybe my hypersensitivity to my surroundings have to do with having the same senses monks usually have when they spend in retreat too much, everything is over magnified, also probably caffeine.

When did you push a doctor who didn’t believe you?,"I've had terrible anxiety and stress when I was 15-16 and my abdomen started hurting so much, I would have trouble keeping down what I eat. The pain got so bad, I would even throw up after drinking water. I was already anemic and underweight but those symptoms made that matter even worse.

My doctor told me the pain and nausea is caused by my stress and was ""just in my head."" It's only after I found blood when throwing up that they figured it might be a physical issue after all.

Lo and behold, they found out - after a few days at the hospital and an endoscopy - that I had a bleeding stomach ulcer which is why ingesting anything would bring so much physical pain and discomfort.

It took more than a dozen cardiologists and over 20 years of visiting doctors for one to finally believe her.

When did you push a doctor who didn’t believe you?,"I always had gynecological problems because of a failed surgery when i was child. Since then i had one surgery because of cysts and other stuff exactly because of that surgery. Back then, my doctor told me to be prepared for another surgery in few years, most probably when i will be 18. And there it was. The pain got back when i hit 18 and i knew it was time. I told my gynecologist that i need a surgery. She asked me why so i told her to check me. She found NOTHING. No cysts, nothing. So I believed her and i was happy like yay maybe its really over. She got me on some medication to prevent such things to even happen and sent me home.
Month later. I had to call an ambulance. Blood was rushing out of me and pain hit me like crazy. It was not my time of the month and it sure never hurt like that. Five doctors had to look at me to be sure that what they see on my sonos are cysts. There were two of them. They told me I could go on with some medication to get them smaller. I said F**K NO. I ve been in this situation on my first surgery and I knew it would not work. I immediately called my doctor to get me the f**king surgery. She did. 
Day before surgery. The head of the hospital that was supposed to do the surgery called for me and gave me a speech about risks im taking by having surgery only because of cysts. In pain that lasted for over a year i said DO IT.
Few hours after surgery. I woke up. It was like 3pm. I immediately screamed because of the pain and they had to put me to sleep again. I woke up 5pm. I got worried because the told me i would be up atleast at 1pm. Until the late evening i did not know what happened. Then the doctors show up to tell all the patients results of the surgery. Everyone except me. An hour later my doctor show up walking to me like on a funeral. What he told me? My left fallopian had rotten. Literally. Because of the first f**ked up surgery and because of a bad recovery from the second one. Also he told me they had to take care of other stuff and ofcourse the cysts because they looked really bad when the saw them from inside. And also that he is very sorry that he underestimated me.
Half a year later im recovered. Not fully, that will never be obviously but im happy its over and that the worst is behind me.

I continued to have pain for the next year or so, after every time I ate, including anything actually healthy. I finally did a consultation with a surgeon my (nurse) uncle recommended and he at least gave me the option after seeing my paperwork. He explained that the surgery may not fix the issue entirely, but in cases like mine, it usually at least provides some amount of relief.

What do you wish you would’ve learned sooner?,"That innate intelligence is not only enough, but may also be largely a lie.


If I could live my childhood all over again knowing one tip from future-me, it would be to live as if I was deaf to all the adults telling me how “smart” and “mature” I was. It conditioned me to fear failure, which led to me fearing trying anything new. Now, I have huge commitment and motivation issues and am a perfectionist to a fault.

Lately, I’m able to sometimes hit override on my brain and just push through with tasks because I know trying and failing are the foundations of trying and succeeding.

"Women who have had/currently have panic disorder, how do you manage?","I’ve had anxiety my entire life thanks to a shitty childhood. I’m 28 now and was only just recently diagnosed with ptsd and anxiety. 

My symptoms became completely unmanageable this summer, to the point I couldn’t work a six hour shift without crying or my heart pounding so fast, I felt nauseous. 

I started only sleeping for 4 hours every night, then waking up sick and puking. I told my therapist how bad it had gotten, and she urged me to seek out a medical doctor. 

It’s been two months, and I’ve finally found out I have Grave’s disease (aka a type of hyperthyroidism) , which is causing my anxiety (amongst a long list of other terrible things.) 

I could not manage this on my own. I had to quit my job and focus on my health atm. 

During the panic attacks I was suffering over the year leading up to this, everything would white-out to the point I was dizzy, though, I never actually fainted. I can’t imagine having waited much longer to seek help. Although this illness is easily managed with proper care, it can cause death if it isn’t treated.

I've had it so bad that my dad had to cradle me so i could calm down. i was also constantly told by psychologists to use the ""Find 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and one thing you can taste"" method. It worked as long as someone forced me to focus because most of the time its hard to concentrate when you feel like you can't breathe.

"Women who have had/currently have panic disorder, how do you manage?","Lots of good thoughts here already. The one that's helped me out the most, which hasn't been mentioned yet (at the time of this comment), was to be aware that this is not a heart problem, you (most likely - for me, always and reliably) are not going to faint, and it's going to go away within about 20min no matter what I do or what I don't do.

I can make myself more comfortable, I can use meds, I can do therapy stuff, I can have all sorts of techniques, but it makes a big difference for me to know that I don't have to \*be able to\* stop it. All I have to do is wait it out. And it isn't going to actually hurt me meanwhile.

I'm 'doubly lucky' now. I've recently picked up frequent PVC with periodic SVT/PSVT (mostly-harmless heart palpitations) with the onset of perimenopause, and it and anxiety seem to have a sort of circular thing going where they cause each other.

What’s a tip that every woman should know which might one day save her life?,"Coming from experience. Even if it is a boyfriend, do not get in a vehicle with someone who is being aggressive. And trust your gut. If you feel like you’re in danger do NOT go with them to try and calm the situation or avoid a scene. You can make up an excuse if you need but don’t get in a car alone. 

If they try to physically put you in a vehicle you have to be nasty. Like really nasty. And loud. Kick them in the balls, go after their eyes, their throat. Once it’s to the point of an attack, you do not owe them restraint. If you get a window, run. Into the nearest store or business or group of people. You may be strong but fighting like that is not sustainable. Fight for a window, take the window, and run while you still have the energy.  

I know this sounds like overkill, but these things can happen out of nowhere. From men you thought were puppy dogs. You will know the difference between a normal argument and an impending attack. And you should trust your gut. My attacker was a boyfriend and the situation escalated to firearm involvement.

Women who had a father daughter dance at your wedding: What did your dad say to you during your dance?,My Dad was never one for emotions. So we are dancing our father/daughter dance and he leans over my shoulder - he’s well over 6 feet tall and I’m a shorty - I try to move him off me and I see he’s now clutching his chest.

Just cried. I’m his only daughter.

How often do you notice male privilege in your life?,"I guess that depends on how you define male privilege, to be honest. I often enough notice that a lot of company leaders are male.

I notice that there aren't many female engineers at my company. I notice that there aren't any female coaches in pro football.

How often do you notice male privilege in your life?,"I see it a lot working in a male-dominated field. But the worst I've seen lately actually happened at the repair shop a few weeks ago. I've been driving my car for 13 years - it's great to have a car that long because you really learn the ins and outs of it, exactly what it can and can't do (maneuverability), and all the little quirks and sounds it makes. I've done a lot of my own work on it - replaced the whole tail light, replacing headlights, even replaced the window motor and regulator on the passenger side. Nothing engine related though. So basically, it's my baby. So a car has a lot of bushings. When bushings wear out, your car will start to squeak when you go over bumps (sounds a lot like a creaky bed during sex LOL). I took it in for a full inspection of the suspension and explained the sounds I was hearing. Once it was ready to pick up, my boyfriend (of 4 years) came in with me ... and the mechanic (male) only talked to my boyfriend. Things like that are irritating af. Basically, in terms of *my car*, this mechanic chose to talk to an amateur instead of the professional.

Unfortunately, or fortunately, I understand why now. It's scary to not know what people want. After I started presenting female, I became a lot more uncomfortable around men.

"Do you read fanfiction? If so, for what fandom?","I love all kinds of fanfiction and have been reading and writing it for over 15 years! I started in the Jane Austen fandom, the most vanilla fandom possible, haha, and then moved into HP fandom, after which nothing will ever shock me again. I was a pretty well-known Harry/Draco slasher for a number of years. Since then I've read fic in just about every major fandom there is, and I've written fic in Prince of Tennis, Hikaru no Go, Death Note, Merlin, and various slash and femslash RPF fandoms. 

But the best fandom out of all of them that I've found is Inception fandom. Best fic, most brilliant worldbuilding, most unforgettable romance (this fandom basically just took Arthur/Eames and turned it into an epic lifechanging romance, oh my god), and most creative and positive fandom community I've ever been in. I love them so much.

"Do you read fanfiction? If so, for what fandom?","I always held my choice fanfiction into 3 categories,

Wide universe: like comics or epic fantasy/sci-fi, where there are many stories to tell and things are generally flexible enough to make some small changes without upsetting the main arcs. This is also great video game stuff here. Star Wars, Marvel, DC and such.

Failed potential: things that have amazing premises and/or starts but kinda trail off or miss entirely, I like to see the possibilities. Harry Potter is a big one here, as is alot of anime, like Naruto, great premise, terrible execution. 

And everything else. Would probably have to come from a recommendation of someone I trust the taste of, but I won't go looking though things I find complete enough on their own. Crossovers, the occasional Buffy story. 

I read alot in high school reading all the Star Wars books, because that's just licensed fan fiction, I have let off quite a bit now after college.

"What's with the popularity of ""women's health?""","I'm not sure what the definitive reason is (you'd have to ask the person who designed the content of your hospital's website) but I have two guesses.

* Women's set of specialized needs is substantially larger than men's, given the complexity of our internal plumbing. It's possible that the unisex stuff was just added to the list because women seemed to be asking about it a lot.

* The majority of us will bear children. Doctors take fetal development very, very seriously, since dealing with birth defects is both heartbreaking and unprofitable. Making sure that women take care of their health (because pregnancy is frequently unexpected) is a good way to prevent problems in the crucial first weeks of cellular differentiation.

"How many of you ladies have gotten back with your SO after a breakup, and how?","I tried it once. It was about 2 years later. I liked it a lot, it just wasn't meant to be. We went to separate colleges. In another universe, it would have worked!",7,1rejvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1rejvm/how_many_of_you_ladies_have_gotten_back_with_your/,33,1385391814.0,"Hi there lovely ladies,

I'm a 20 year old female and it's been a month (exactly) since my boyfriend of 1.5 years broke up with me. 
I've gone through the motions and confusions, and I don't really know what to think or how to go about this. He's mentioned that he's open to the idea of getting back together but it'll take some time, and not only just that. 
Basically our relationship ending was a snowball effect. It started with the complete lack of sexual intimacy (from my side). I personally have never had a sexual libido, and he had a very high one. This was major problem number one. Also I'm on the pill and have been diagnosed with Vaginismus in the past year, after a very painful first sexual experience with him. 
Also I tended to lie quite a lot, especially about sex and stuff. One of my main lies was that I was supposed to use a dilator -to help my vaginismus- and i lied to him for 4 months straight before I finally came out with the truth. This completely destroyed him emotionally and he said that that was the point he knew this wasn't going to work out. The sexual side went with the lying.
I don't understand him at the moment, he still has feelings for me, but sometimes it's just...as though he never wants to rekindle anything. He always touches my legs/kisses my hand or face or tries to show he still cares. He even has still the password on his phone as my nickname. Once he even spun me around and cuddled me very affectionately. It's like he's trying to still show some affection but also being very cold at the same time. I've actually taken to not phoning or contacting him first now, but he always comes through first. Also he mentions things that are a bit hurtful like today we were passing an art store and he just said randomly ""thats where I got the paper for your love-heart for valentines day. It cost so much per piece.'' I was just like ""why do you need to say that?""
Also yesterday, he said ""don't tag me in your Facebook status about seeing Catching Fire..because you know...It'll look weird and I don't want people to see that we are together."" That really fucking hurt. I was really put off for the rest of the night after that. He just brings up shit like that all the time without me even mentioning the relationship. If anything, I want to forget and move on, but he keeps bringing it up. He then apologised for this when I brought it up. 

At the moment, I guess I'm pretty upset, because he's gone all cold and distant and I just want to be with him so much. He was the loveliest guy, amidst the panic attacks and severe OCD. 
He told me the other day he has no interest in fixing our problems that we had with the relationship, and he'd rather work on a friendly, happy friendship. The problem is, I'll always want more out of him than a friendship. We never had sex (thanks to me...) and I feel I really missed the boat there with him because he was such a loving, patient and caring boyfriend. I've said to him I'm prepared to work through things, even if he isn't, but atm he just seems to be blocking everything and also being really negative about any future. 'Sorry it's really not going to work.' whilst hugging me tightly and also kissing my hand, it's just confusing. He thinks that if we got back together, the same problems would just arise and it would be a wasted effort. Urgh! I just wish I had some hope of something, but I know he's trying not to give me 'false hope.' 

Is this normal guy behaviour? Has this happened to any of you ladies before?  

I've told him I'm actually doing the dilators now and he's very happy with that. Also going to see a psych about my lying, so I am damn well solving my problems! :) 

Long story short, how many of you women have rekindled the relationship after taking a break? How long did it take? How did you do it? 
Thanks! ",2013-11-25 10:03:34
"How many of you ladies have gotten back with your SO after a breakup, and how?","My boyfriend and I have dated for 8 years, and the last three have been very tumultuous.  We've broken up maybe 5 times--and I'm talking complete, no-contact breakups that have lasted for as long as five months.  

For us, I think we had some personality issues to work through and we also just didn't understand how to conduct an adult relationship.  Because we got together so young, we missed out on some of the experiences that teach you how to be in a relationship.  We weren't sure if we were perfect for each other, or holding each other back in some way.  We needed time apart to explore the world before we knew that we wanted to explore it together.  We also had a lot of growing up to do.  

In your situation, I hesitate to give you any advice.  Play it how you feel it, and know that the ""wisdom"" you get from others is often completely unrelatable to your own experience.  If someone told me that I would get back together with the same guy after five serious breakups, I would call them crazy.  On the surface, it is crazy.  Underneath that, I have a deep and wonderful relationship with someone who makes me happier than anyone else ever has, who is closer to me than my family, and I'm glad I was stupid enough to try again all those times.",7,1rejvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1rejvm/how_many_of_you_ladies_have_gotten_back_with_your/,33,1385391814.0,"Hi there lovely ladies,

I've gone through the motions and confusions, and I don't really know what to think or how to go about this. He's mentioned that he's open to the idea of getting back together but it'll take some time, and not only just that. 
Basically our relationship ending was a snowball effect. It started with the complete lack of sexual intimacy (from my side). I personally have never had a sexual libido, and he had a very high one. This was major problem number one. Also I'm on the pill and have been diagnosed with Vaginismus in the past year, after a very painful first sexual experience with him. 
Also I tended to lie quite a lot, especially about sex and stuff. One of my main lies was that I was supposed to use a dilator -to help my vaginismus- and i lied to him for 4 months straight before I finally came out with the truth. This completely destroyed him emotionally and he said that that was the point he knew this wasn't going to work out. The sexual side went with the lying.
I don't understand him at the moment, he still has feelings for me, but sometimes it's just...as though he never wants to rekindle anything. He always touches my legs/kisses my hand or face or tries to show he still cares. He even has still the password on his phone as my nickname. Once he even spun me around and cuddled me very affectionately. It's like he's trying to still show some affection but also being very cold at the same time. I've actually taken to not phoning or contacting him first now, but he always comes through first. Also he mentions things that are a bit hurtful like today we were passing an art store and he just said randomly ""thats where I got the paper for your love-heart for valentines day. It cost so much per piece.'' I was just like ""why do you need to say that?""
Also yesterday, he said ""don't tag me in your Facebook status about seeing Catching Fire..because you know...It'll look weird and I don't want people to see that we are together."" That really fucking hurt. I was really put off for the rest of the night after that. He just brings up shit like that all the time without me even mentioning the relationship. If anything, I want to forget and move on, but he keeps bringing it up. He then apologised for this when I brought it up. 

At the moment, I guess I'm pretty upset, because he's gone all cold and distant and I just want to be with him so much. He was the loveliest guy, amidst the panic attacks and severe OCD. 
He told me the other day he has no interest in fixing our problems that we had with the relationship, and he'd rather work on a friendly, happy friendship. The problem is, I'll always want more out of him than a friendship. We never had sex (thanks to me...) and I feel I really missed the boat there with him because he was such a loving, patient and caring boyfriend. I've said to him I'm prepared to work through things, even if he isn't, but atm he just seems to be blocking everything and also being really negative about any future. 'Sorry it's really not going to work.' whilst hugging me tightly and also kissing my hand, it's just confusing. He thinks that if we got back together, the same problems would just arise and it would be a wasted effort. Urgh! I just wish I had some hope of something, but I know he's trying not to give me 'false hope.' 

Is this normal guy behaviour? Has this happened to any of you ladies before?  

I've told him I'm actually doing the dilators now and he's very happy with that. Also going to see a psych about my lying, so I am damn well solving my problems! :) 

Long story short, how many of you women have rekindled the relationship after taking a break? How long did it take? How did you do it?

"How many of you ladies have gotten back with your SO after a breakup, and how?","Yes - together 2 years, broke up for 7 months, got back together, 11 months later got engaged. That was 5 months ago and I'm marrying him in June.

The reason it worked though was because we'd both changed. We had broken up mainly because he thought he was missing out on single life and had started going off the rails, and it got to the point where we were both fundamentally unhappy. We got back together because he'd experienced single life and realised what he had with me was way better. Meanwhile, I got back together with him because I'd sorted out other stuff that was making me unhappy (home, job) and because I missed him too. I didn't feel happy without him in my life. He felt the same. We talked at length and then decided we had to give it another go, and miraculously really, it worked. And was/is wayyyy better than anything we'd had before.

The point is - unless you're BOTH in a different emotional space, you may struggle to rekindle the relationship in any meaningful way. Because ultimately you'll just meet the same issues you did before.

My analysis of your situation above is probably that he misses your friendship and the closeness you had, but that he broke up with you because it wasn't working, and he's aware of that. As such, my advice would be to just put some distance between the two of you. At this stage, he's not your friend, he's your ex - however hard that is to think of, and however hard it is to reject him in that way. Give him (and yourself) some space, and trust that love will find you in the future - whether it's him again, or someone else.

"How many of you ladies have gotten back with your SO after a breakup, and how?","My exboyfriend and I were apart for a year with sparse contact on purpose. We have always been so compatible in terms of conversation that even weekly contact would end up with us falling back into something closely resembling a relationship. We got together young so our idea of 10/10s are essentially based off each other. Sexually and conversationally, we're perfect for each other. 

Bigger picture, he and I have quite a few differences that made things difficult. We wouldn't spend the time apart actually working on those things, we'd just be ""on"" or ""off"" and the same issues would keep cropping up.  

After a year, it was the same issues over and over, and we ended up cooling it once and for all. If those issues could be worked out, in a heartbeat I'd be back with him. I can't even talk to him or see him regularly now without feeling an intense amount of sexual and emotional attraction to him.

We never had sex (thanks to me...) and I feel I really missed the boat there with him because he was such a loving, patient and caring boyfriend. I've said to him I'm prepared to work through things, even if he isn't, but atm he just seems to be blocking everything and also being really negative about any future. 'Sorry it's really not going to work.' whilst hugging me tightly and also kissing my hand, it's just confusing. He thinks that if we got back together, the same problems would just arise and it would be a wasted effort. Urgh! I just wish I had some hope of something, but I know he's trying not to give me 'false hope.' 

Is this normal guy behaviour? Has this happened to any of you ladies before?  

I've told him I'm actually doing the dilators now and he's very happy with that. Also going to see a psych about my lying, so I am damn well solving my problems! :) 

Long story short, how many of you women have rekindled the relationship after taking a break? How long did it take? How did you do it?

"How many of you ladies have gotten back with your SO after a breakup, and how?","I have definitely been guilty of getting back together after a breakup. The last time that happened was with my current SO. I kicked him out of our apartment (he had a place to go and I didn't). We ended up talking here and there and having a few sleepovers, but I wasn't happy with the idea that when he wasn't with me he was at the bar all the time and possibly hooking up with other people (he swore he wasn't, long story).  

I told him after almost 3 months that unless he was serious about fixing things, I didn't want anything to do with him. It was harsh. I should maybe have waited until I was less drunk to hit Send on that text, but it felt gangster as fuck. He didn't text me back, and that was all the answer I needed. I was not surprised, but I was still pretty disappointed. 

Several days later, he showed up at my work. We texted some that night, had a beer the next day, and have been joined at the hip ever since. Things have been a lot better, too.",7,1rejvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1rejvm/how_many_of_you_ladies_have_gotten_back_with_your/,33,1385391814.0,"Hi there lovely ladies,

I'm a 20 year old female and it's been a month (exactly) since my boyfriend of 1.5 years broke up with me. 
I've gone through the motions and confusions, and I don't really know what to think or how to go about this. He's mentioned that he's open to the idea of getting back together but it'll take some time, and not only just that. 
Basically our relationship ending was a snowball effect. It started with the complete lack of sexual intimacy (from my side). I personally have never had a sexual libido, and he had a very high one. This was major problem number one. Also I'm on the pill and have been diagnosed with Vaginismus in the past year, after a very painful first sexual experience with him. 
Also I tended to lie quite a lot, especially about sex and stuff. One of my main lies was that I was supposed to use a dilator -to help my vaginismus- and i lied to him for 4 months straight before I finally came out with the truth. This completely destroyed him emotionally and he said that that was the point he knew this wasn't going to work out. The sexual side went with the lying.
I don't understand him at the moment, he still has feelings for me, but sometimes it's just...as though he never wants to rekindle anything. He always touches my legs/kisses my hand or face or tries to show he still cares. He even has still the password on his phone as my nickname. Once he even spun me around and cuddled me very affectionately. It's like he's trying to still show some affection but also being very cold at the same time. I've actually taken to not phoning or contacting him first now, but he always comes through first. Also he mentions things that are a bit hurtful like today we were passing an art store and he just said randomly ""thats where I got the paper for your love-heart for valentines day. It cost so much per piece.'' I was just like ""why do you need to say that?""
Also yesterday, he said ""don't tag me in your Facebook status about seeing Catching Fire..because you know...It'll look weird and I don't want people to see that we are together."" That really fucking hurt. I was really put off for the rest of the night after that. He just brings up shit like that all the time without me even mentioning the relationship. If anything, I want to forget and move on, but he keeps bringing it up. He then apologised for this when I brought it up. 

At the moment, I guess I'm pretty upset, because he's gone all cold and distant and I just want to be with him so much. He was the loveliest guy, amidst the panic attacks and severe OCD. 
He told me the other day he has no interest in fixing our problems that we had with the relationship, and he'd rather work on a friendly, happy friendship. The problem is, I'll always want more out of him than a friendship. We never had sex (thanks to me...) and I feel I really missed the boat there with him because he was such a loving, patient and caring boyfriend.

"I've been really depressed, I'm convinced my girlfriend is done with me. Could some women give me their outside perspective?","It sounds like your girlfriend hasn't given up on you yet! She is giving you a deliberate push to help you get your life back together and be the man she fell in love with. She sounds like a keeper, and you sound like you are too as long as you do everything you say you want to.",2,10omq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/10omq0/ive_been_really_depressed_im_convinced_my/,3,1348983612.0,"Please forgive the novel, I'm just gonna kinda put everything on the table. It's seriously way too long of a post.

My gf and I (m) are both 26. We've been dating for about a year and a half.

We had always had a lot of mutual friends, before we dated, but we were never single at the same time, and never saw each other that often. By the time we did start to see each other, I had just finished pulling myself out of a pretty rough place. I didn't have a job, but I had saved up a ton of money from my previous job, I lived on my own, I was in a good place, and super confident. This attracted her to me, and I started laying it on pretty thick, and before long we were hooking up.

In the beginning, it was insane how much we clicked. We had similar dreams and ambitions, it was so easy for us to get comfortable around each other, we went out all the time, we had sex constantly. She, essentially, never left my place. I had had a rough couple of years before this, and I kinda just gave myself to it. We fell head over heels for each other in no time.

She ended up getting her own place, after spending maybe a month or two constantly at mine. I helped her move in, and then I just.... never left. A few months later, I got rid of my apartment. There just wasn't any sense, despite how quickly the relationship moved, that there would be any drama down the road.

And there wasn't, for a loooong time. Things were great. They were amazing.

I fucked up, though. I really never wanted that first summer to end. I wanted to keep doing things with her, I wanted to lounge with her, and I didn't really wanna do anything else. I don't think I was ever overtly clingy. She could go out and do her own thing, do things with her friends on her own, whatever, none of it bothered me, as long as we still did things together.

I gave a half-hearted attempt at a new job (which I still didn't really *need*, but that time would come). I gave a half-hearted attempt at school (which I do need, but I have serious trouble motivating myself to keep at it). In time, I really just became... a slob, I guess. Not a slob, literally. I cleaned the apartment, I took care of myself, I still showed exuberant gestures of love, but I was just always home. I didn't even make much of an effort with my friends unless my girlfriend made plans with them.

This went on... for longer than I'd like to admit. My girlfriend started pulling away. It was our rapport that made us fall in love, but the things about me that attracted her to me in the first place just didn't exist anymore.

She started to pull away. She went out with her friends, without me, almost constantly. We would be silent while she was home. Eventually she started staying the night out frequently. This started to weigh heavily on me. I hadn't put two and two together, I didn't get that I was becoming that roommate that's always in the living room that you can't avoid, I just didn't understand why she didn't want to go out with me anymore, or lounge with me. This has been going on for several weeks now, and it's been seriously eating away at me, and as opposed to motivating me, which it should have, it just drained me. I just stayed at home, feeling sorry for myself.

Anyway, onto this week. We had had a plan, several months ago, that at some point down the road, I'd move out for 6 months or so, so she could have a crack at living on her own, something she hasn't gotten the chance to experience. Anyway, this week, after seeing her for all of maybe an hour in the past day or two, she comes home, and she tells me that we need to move up the timetable, that I really need to get out of the apartment, because she feels uncomfortable coming home, and thus distracted from her responsibilities.

She never outright said we were breaking up, and she even said that she thought it would improve the relationship, but everything about the discussion... it just felt like a break-up to me. I am not, in any way, opposed to the idea of moving out. Looking back, now, on the past several months, I'm humiliated. I still gave her nice gifts, I still pulled my weight at home, but I just didn't give her space while she was here, and I didn't have a life while she wasn't.

Anyway, another day or two passes, and I'm just... in really bad shape, but things are still pleasant (though I still hardly see her). She gets home, and we have another talk. This talk, I'm acknowledging what's been going on, and the burden I've been. I'm going to move out as soon as possible, I'm gonna get work, I'm gonna land on my feet. But, I still love her, I still wanna be a part of her life, I want to help her succeed. I want her to have her own space, and I wanna be my own man. It would be our chance to date each other, because we totally skipped that part of a relationship. This discussion went pretty well. It ended with an exchange of ""I love you""s, a hug, and a kiss.

If that had been where it ended, I would be happy, but... I seriously fucked up this time. We had had plans for a while to see a movie yesterday, and I had given her loads of outs, but she still wanted to. The plan was, I was gonna clean the apartment, then she was gonna come home and we'd see the movie, then I was gonna spend the night at a friend's place so she could have a good time at the apartment without me.

I kinda... had a panic attack yesterday. I cleaned the apartment, and just... I've been pretty inside my head lately and I was just suddenly overwhelmed by the idea that I was cleaning an apartment, one that I knew so intimately, but I was a stranger to it. And I thought about all the good times or whatever, and I'm just assaulting myself with ""She's over it, dude. Give up. She's probably already seeing someone else you fucking moron."" It totally wasn't one of my prouder moments, and I was ready to just ignore it, but then I call her, just to ask what time she wanted to see the movie, and she doesn't, her friends want to go out right away once she's done with school. The maximum amount of time I had seen her at once all week was, maybe, about 40 minutes.

That just totally broke me. I brought her the keys to the apartment, and I was kinda teary-eyed, and I just told her that I was gonna be out all weekend, and I was gonna move out at the beginning of next week, and I just couldn't deal with staying in that apartment anymore. She looked totally stunned, and just said, ""I thought we had a good talk the other day."" And it just ended with her saying she'd talk to me later.

I left, and I tried to make plans with friends, but it was last minute, and I ended up sleeping in a hotel.

When I woke up, I was.... totally mortified about how I had acted. I ended up coming home, right before my girlfriend was leaving for lunch, and I apologized and said I was embarrassed and what have you, and she said it was fine. It was pleasant, but... yeah, after my pity-party yesterday, it was just different. It was just... cold, I guess. She went out to lunch, and I think she had plans to stay out tonight anyway. She might come home before then, but I don't even know if it'd be... a good thing. I feel like what I did yesterday just totally invalidates the discussion we had a few days ago. We're gonna see the movie tomorrow, but at the end of the day, and I really wouldn't be surprised if I didn't see her until then.

I'd like to think that the picture I've painted of myself in this post is less flattering than the reality, because I'm obviously in rough shape right now. I mean, I get along with all of her friends and family amazingly, I'm witty, attractive, whatever. This is the person I've been, though. And I'm really breaking down because I don't have anyone to talk to about it. All I can manage to say about her to my friends is how cool and great I think she is, and how much I love her, and I just cringe to think what she tells her friends about me.

Sorry, this went on entirely too long.

Feel sorta neglected and like something is 'up' -advise how how to approach the situation?,"When you talk to her, use ""I"" statements instead of ""You"" statements, that way you're focusing on your own feelings rather than accusing her. For example say ""I've been feeling neglected lately"" vs ""You've been neglecting me lately.""

Be honest with her, and tell her how you feel. Communication is hard for the majority of people, but it's something that has to happen in order to have a healthy relationship. You can even start out the conversation that way, by letting her know that you understand these types of conversations can be uncomfortable, but you really value her and your relationship, so it's important that you talk it out.

Edit - To answers a few more of your questions, no, you're not overreacting. If you're unhappy with the way things are, or the way she's treating you, you have every right to say something. ",5,12z60x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/12z60x/feel_sorta_neglected_and_like_something_is_up/,1,1352606867.0,"(this will probably end up long winded and run-on so TL;DR will be at the end. im gunna do my best to side both sides of this as to not make her out to be a bad person... after all every story has two sides)

**Side A:** 
I've been with my GF now for a little over a year (14 months to be exact) and things have been if not great certainly manageable. we (21m and 20f) rarely ever fight and on the very rare occasion we do, its resolved quickly since we tend to be open minded and willing to negotiate. The problem here lies in a few things... First of all my gf has a pretty prominent communication problem. I'm the guy who stresses communication pretty seriously in a relationship and she seems to have a much more blurry perception of the grey area specifically between 'taking one for the team' and 'neglecting to confront'. 99 times out of 100 this isn't a huge issue and doesn't cause a problem with us. The problem here is that over time (lets say 6months~ on) she seems to have grown distant and become less interested in me. Our sex life became virtually non existent (breaks of 1-2 months aren't uncommon even right now we're almost 2 months into a dry spell), as compared to fooling around almost daily and sex would be a few times a week. She seems a lot less comfortable saying 'i love you' in person and over all less willing to see each other 'just because' (ie outside of planned meetings or necessity) part of me understands that to some small extent these things tend to happen during a relationship at random points/intervals and im willing to accept that and move past it. My problem is it all APPEARS (see part B to see other end of this argument) these all started changing after her ex showed back up. Our get together was a tad complicated because said Ex is a very close friend of mine (was before their break up and still remains so). She and He broke up over falling apart and they both kinda saw the inevitability of it. Shortly after (less than a week) she and i got together and tried to keep the relationship on the down low for His sake (not to hide it per say but in respect of his feelings since we both still cared about him to an extent). Now i (as well as her closest friend) are convinced that he isn't over her as much as he could be and its in the realm of possibility he's trying to regain ground with their relationship. I've done my best to give her/them their privacy as far as their friendship, but lately i've been skeptical. I just dont feel like she feels the same way about me anymore and that she in a sense isn't pulling her weight in the relationship anymore...

**Side B:** 
She has a lot of stress in her life be it her parents current and 'less than clean' divorce thats in the process, her full time work schedule and full time school schedule. i COMPLETELY empathize with her on this and give her the appropriate space to work, relax, and be comfortable- while still retaining a healthy relationship. As far as the sex life goes- said Best friend mentioned before told me that this low sex drive is nothing new, and WAS prevalent during her previous relationship with said Ex. And as stated above i accept that feelings might tend to dull a little after time, and maybe she is getting a little too 'comfortable' with our relationship and is letting her belt loose a bit. And as mentioned above- she has an issue with expressing emotions and im willing to accept/work with that.  Also, i admit whole-heartedly admit i have a mild jealous side. i say mild not to downplay it but im not that horribly controlling person that pulls his girlfriend by the wrist around town, but i DO feel like she's too good for me, and belongs with someone better- thus making me insecure and jealous. Finally she hasn't done anything to me or previous Ex to prove any type of cheating going on.  

The tricky part is her ex. I get the impression (though she has never come out and said it) Mr Ex was VERY manipulative in their relationship. To the point that she doesnt know how to properly have sex (she acts as if she was instructed by Ex to 'just sit there and let him take care of it') and these occurrences have crippled her sex drive, self esteem, and emotional contact. I admit our relationship would probably be a lot less rocky and more stable if he were out of the picture entirely, but i dont think that's possible given our group of friend and the fact that i dont want that held over my head that 'i made her give up a friend for me etc etc' and even though i dont think she's the kinda girl to do that- you cant be too careful ya know?

So my final question after giving you ALL this information is: how do i approach her about these feelings? How can i tell her i feel a little neglected and one-sided without implicating shes the bad guy and responsible for all our trouble? On the converse, how can i approach the fact that i feel like Ex really screwed with her head and for the better of our relationship and more-so herself, she needs to confront it? and finally how can i confront her about not being so comfortable with her current friendship with Ex without sounding overbearing and jealous? 

**TL;DR** Girlfriend seems more distant and possibly losing interest in my over Ex, and has deep rooted problems that affect important parts of our relationship. Am i over reacting, or am i justified? if so, how can i approach these subject without attacking her, while still keeping her feelings in mind?
