"Women who were diagnosed with serious medical conditions after originally being dismissed as a hypochondriac, what's your story?","Oh you mean being a chronically ill woman?

I was told I was fat, not sick. Until I stopped seeing male doctors

"Women who were diagnosed with serious medical conditions after originally being dismissed as a hypochondriac, what's your story?","When I was in high school I started to feel tired all the time, had bad body rashes that were so itchy I scratched in my sleep and my neck started to look thick. My mom was frustrated that I was an extra lazy teen and concerned that I was ruining my skin with scarring, so she took me to a dermatologist who tried different treatments for months. Eventually at a family gathering, a family friend and MD pulled me aside with my mom so he could take a look at my neck swelling. He told us to go to a specialist ASAP and boom, it was Hodgkin's lymphoma - cancer of the lymph nodes! 

That was a long time ago and I'm perfectly healthy now. My mom felt awful for a long time for not making the connection that all these things were adding up to something bigger but I'm a mom now and I know for sure I wouldn't have made the connection between a thick neck, itchy legs and ""laziness"" as being cancer either!",15,hrmhuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/hrmhuv/women_who_were_diagnosed_with_serious_medical/,19,1594844269.0,,2020-07-15 16:17:49
"Women who were diagnosed with serious medical conditions after originally being dismissed as a hypochondriac, what's your story?","My case isnt serious at all, but I complained about bellyaches for about 5 years (about age 13 to 18)and doctors dismissing it as wanting attention, being stressed or psychological problems 

They once put me 2 weeks in quarantine in hospital (when I was 15) and only let people see me in those weird suits that made everyone look like astronauts. I felt very lonely in those 2 weeks but they didn't find anything and sent me home. They also said I should see a therapist

Years later my mum tried a diet and we went a month without milk and stuff

I'm fking lactose intolerant",15,hrmhuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/hrmhuv/women_who_were_diagnosed_with_serious_medical/,19,1594844269.0,,2020-07-15 16:17:49
"Women who were diagnosed with serious medical conditions after originally being dismissed as a hypochondriac, what's your story?","I had a UTI, was given a 3 day course of antibiotics. It wasn’t enough so I went back to the dr and got told I was imagining the burning and the blood. 

That continued for years (at one point I was making almost weekly appointments but it was in my notes that I was making it up so other doctors wouldn’t prescribe more antibiotics) until I moved away and changed doctors. The new doctor sent me for scans and x-rays, where it was discovered I had a stag horn kidney stone taking up 3/4 of my kidney. 

Multiple operations and lithotripsy sessions later, my kidney was a mass of scar tissue that was just causing kidney infection upon kidney infection. Had my kidney removed and was told the exact same thing will happen to my other kidney as I’m now a stone former and there’s nothing they can do to stop/prevent it.",15,hrmhuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/hrmhuv/women_who_were_diagnosed_with_serious_medical/,19,1594844269.0,,2020-07-15 16:17:49
"Women who were diagnosed with serious medical conditions after originally being dismissed as a hypochondriac, what's your story?","I kept seeing my doctor because I was tired all the time and it didn’t seem normal. He ordered blood tests for iron and thyroid and both were fine. Went back six months later, same blood tests, same results. This went on for 15 years and in the end I just assumed I was lazy. 
Then I went to the doctor for something unrelated - asking about vaccinations. It was a different doctor who I’d never seen before filling in for my usual doctor. She glanced at my records, looked at my hands and asked if I’d ever been tested for rheumatoid arthritis. She sent me for tests and the results were absolutely sky high, indicating I’d probably had it for years and that’s why I was so bloody exhausted all the time. It literally took her 20 seconds to look me over and decide I needed that blood test. Now I’m medicated (for life) and I feel a lot better most days. Also, my usual doctor *really* listens to me now which is nice.",15,hrmhuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/hrmhuv/women_who_were_diagnosed_with_serious_medical/,19,1594844269.0,,2020-07-15 16:17:49
"Women who were diagnosed with serious medical conditions after originally being dismissed as a hypochondriac, what's your story?","I spent 7 years looking for an explanation for my chronic pain. Areas behind my knees, at my elbows, my neck and jaw were always tender and sore. It was always worse after work in the evening. I saw blood specialists, thyroid specialists, and even pain doctors. One even handed me a card to go to a fibro support group. It wasn't until a gastroenterologist pointed out I appeared to be very allergic to pork (main part of my weekly diet).

I was referred to an allergist who was involved in researching Alpha Gal. One of the indicators was allergies to pork, beef and lamb. 150 scratches and 75 surface injections later it was determined I in fact did have Alpha Gal. This was a result of a tick bite several years early (around the time I started having issues). My lymphatic system was for all intents and purposes chronically inflamed and my breathing issues was not COPD as I had been diagnosed but allergic reaction to what I had been eating.

3 years post diagnosis and I am slowly getting back to be the active person I was in the past. A complete overhaul of my diet was the first step with the biggest result. Pain for the most part is gone and I am slowly losing the weight I gained by being so inactive before.",15,hrmhuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/hrmhuv/women_who_were_diagnosed_with_serious_medical/,19,1594844269.0,,2020-07-15 16:17:49
"Women who were diagnosed with serious medical conditions after originally being dismissed as a hypochondriac, what's your story?","I developed Hashimotos and was feeling incredibly shitty. Like absolutely no energy. I was so weak that I'd walk up one flight of stairs and then I had to lie down because of how exhausted I was. When I told my doctor about how shitty I felt he just said it's because of stress. And this was in a period in my life where I literally did nothing that could have caused me any sort of stress. I was on a 4 month summer break after doing a semester abroad where I literally did fuck all but enjoy my life. But sure, stress.",15,hrmhuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/hrmhuv/women_who_were_diagnosed_with_serious_medical/,19,1594844269.0,,2020-07-15 16:17:49
"Women who were diagnosed with serious medical conditions after originally being dismissed as a hypochondriac, what's your story?","I was diagnosed (by biopsy) with Crohn's disease at 7. I started having what clearly were symptoms in preschool, and from birth I never ate, grew or rested well. 

From the first time my mom brought me to a doctor, to the scope that actually diagnosed me, no less than three doctors (the most involved being University of Michigan) absolutely insisted it was behavioral problems or ""school avoidance behavior"". Sometimes they also insinuated my mom was lying/causing it somehow. The worst incidents were when they sent her a letter threatening to get me taken by the state, and when the school guidance counselor and principal came to my house to drag me out of the bathroom and into class when I was in 2nd grade.",15,hrmhuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/hrmhuv/women_who_were_diagnosed_with_serious_medical/,19,1594844269.0,,2020-07-15 16:17:49
"Women who were diagnosed with serious medical conditions after originally being dismissed as a hypochondriac, what's your story?","I had undiagnosed leg pain for years, it literally would bring me to tears and I was unable to walk. My husband took me to the ER a few times and they would run tests and send me home. Fast forward ten years and we finally discovered my leg pain was because of multiple herniated discs in my back. I had damaged nerves to my legs and feet and that’s what would cause the pain. Five surgeries later and I had my spine fused and I have no pain now! Drs were always puzzled because I never once had back pain, so it was never an area that was looked at. My symptoms didn’t fit the typical diagnosis, and I didn’t physically look like someone who was loving or functioning with the level of pain normally associated with this condition.",15,hrmhuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/hrmhuv/women_who_were_diagnosed_with_serious_medical/,19,1594844269.0,,2020-07-15 16:17:49
"Women who were diagnosed with serious medical conditions after originally being dismissed as a hypochondriac, what's your story?","I'm 21, and doctors have tried to diagnose me since the age of 10. Even though I was always told that I was broken or sick, I was often called a hypochondriac.
It was first this summer that I (probably) got my final dianosis, but they're not totally certain. Still, i'm looking at a treatment that will go on for the next 2 if not 3 years. Being told that was a complete heartbreak. Not because I didn't feel ok about the dianosis itself, but because the reccomended treatment interfered with my plans for the future. I was supposed to start a bachelors education abroad this fall, which won't happen because i'll have to get treated in my home country. Seeing all of my friends and my boyfriend move on up in life while i'm stuck in a hospital sucks. Feeling sick, isolated and behind in life is terrifying. Having an illness controlling my future is making me feel powerless.
So many things about my health journey has been hard. Though one particular thing that's always been particularly hard has been to not be able to explain my situation to others. So many of my former friends, classmates, collegues and teachers has thought of me as an illness faker. I've felt alone since i've never been able to talk to someone else with similiar problems. It's been hard in those ways, and in a million other ways, and it's definitly shaped me a lot as a person.",15,hrmhuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/hrmhuv/women_who_were_diagnosed_with_serious_medical/,19,1594844269.0,,2020-07-15 16:17:49
"Women who were diagnosed with serious medical conditions after originally being dismissed as a hypochondriac, what's your story?","I started getting absolutely crippling headaches in college. So bad I considered suicide (if you’re considering also, please don’t!!). Went to multiple recommended male neurologists who would tap my knees and look into my eyes and send me home, admonishing that they wouldn’t give me pain medicine, which I hadn’t mentioned at all. Or would dismiss me with “take some Advil for your headaches if you want.” 

Finally was talking to my female OBGYN years later who actually believed me and was very concerned. Had an MRI that evening, turned out I had a brain tumor that was bleeding (which is toxic to the brain and the cause of the intense pain). Had surgery and recovered well but have permanent damage. My surgery team was actually all male but I will never again go to an older male doctor for a diagnosis. They didn’t take me seriously enough to do any testing at all which led to a lot of depression for me. Trying to accept my body and life as it is now with a very supportive husband! 

Moral of the story: believe yourself if something is wrong and keep searching for a doctor who will listen!",15,hrmhuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/hrmhuv/women_who_were_diagnosed_with_serious_medical/,19,1594844269.0,,2020-07-15 16:17:49
"Women who were diagnosed with serious medical conditions after originally being dismissed as a hypochondriac, what's your story?","At my smear and in many doctor's appointments through the years I'd complained about my periods being UNBEARABLE. And I mean so heavy that a tampon, pad and even my jeans did nothing to stop the blood running down my leg after a couple hours. Plus cramps that would cause me to vomit and writhe in agony.

""It'll getter better if you get pregnant""

No help for 13 years. Nothing. Nada.

Until I had an ovarian cyst rupture. Cue a week long hospital stay, and MANY drugs later and things are a bit better. I'm still fighting for the surgery to confirm the endometriosis diagnosis, but the NHS in my area is struggling financially (Covid).",15,hrmhuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/hrmhuv/women_who_were_diagnosed_with_serious_medical/,19,1594844269.0,,2020-07-15 16:17:49
"Women who were diagnosed with serious medical conditions after originally being dismissed as a hypochondriac, what's your story?","I was tired all the time as a kid, I needed naps after school in Jr high. I spent years fighting skin so dry it flaked off and wearing hoodies and jeans all summer because I was so cold. My mother kept asking for thyroid and mono tests and being told ""they're fine your daughter is just lazy."" I turned 20, changed practices and saw a doctor for insomnia (I had been up for days). The blood work showed Hashis. When I pulled my old files, you could see my thyroid die test by test over my jr high and high school  years. No one had ever compared the tests, they just kept filing them. The same doctor had also missed much more severe Hashis in my immediate family - one person had a TSH of 75?!?!  (They were just ""old and a smoker."" ) I still don't bother telling doctors that insomnia is actually a sign I'm hypo and need meds adjusted - no one ever believes me.",15,hrmhuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/hrmhuv/women_who_were_diagnosed_with_serious_medical/,19,1594844269.0,,2020-07-15 16:17:49
