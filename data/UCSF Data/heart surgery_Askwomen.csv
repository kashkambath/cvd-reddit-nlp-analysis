Have you or anyone you know had a near death experience (ie. been clinically dead for a minute or so) and what did you/they experience in that moment?,"My dad had a heart attack and spent over 7 minutes without oxygen. He was paddle shocked 5 times and now jokes ""when I die...again..."". He says there was absolutely nothing. No ""white light"", no ""seeing your whole life before your eyes"". Nothing. He said it wasn't even scary since there just wasn't anything. The most jarring thing for him was that he woke up from his medically induced coma earlier than they expected and they didn't have anyone available to pull out his breathing tube, so he was awake for a good 10 hours before they could remove it. He was looking at us very oddly, but couldn't verbalize what the deal was. Apparently all his colors were jumbled and my very white mom looked almost eggplant purple to him. His black nurse wasn't a normal person color at all. When he was finally able to talk he asked my mom why she was purple. Then he asked the nurse if she was black, but he fought with finding words that weren't offensive until he stopped caring about trying and just blurted out ""are you black?!""",10,kqifhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/kqifhk/have_you_or_anyone_you_know_had_a_near_death/,18,1609824517.0,,2021-01-05 00:28:37

She had a sudden peanut allergy (never had one before) and was coding and she saw her dad who had died 20+ years before. He told her that she had to come back and it “wasn’t her time yet”, and she woke up.

On another note, my best friend “died” and came back (medical complications) and she told me she saw nothing. Like she didn’t even realize she had died.

Have you or anyone you know had a near death experience (ie. been clinically dead for a minute or so) and what did you/they experience in that moment?,"I am not sure it counts as a near death experience, but I have a bit of weird amnesia from a house fire I was stuck in.  I remember driving home from work, then I remember a party happening with a bunch of friends coming over, drinking games, playing video games, my grandfather showing up with a dog, and I know I got punched in the face at least once.

Except none of that after I drove home from work happened.  Most of it literally could not have happened, due to people being dead(like my grandfather) or being unavailable due to the location.

I woke up later in the hospital.",10,kqifhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/kqifhk/have_you_or_anyone_you_know_had_a_near_death/,18,1609824517.0,,2021-01-05 00:28:37
Have you or anyone you know had a near death experience (ie. been clinically dead for a minute or so) and what did you/they experience in that moment?,When I was 16 I was about to go into surgery to remove part of my lung. Right as they were about to make an incision the anesthesiologist told the surgeon my lungs had collapsed and I had been without air for 10 minutes. The surgeon was PISSED and kicked the whole anesthesia team out and ended the surgery for another day. From what I remember it was black and I just woke up with a tube down my throat and my hands tied down. Surgeon was really excited when he found out that I was texting to communicate with people.,10,kqifhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/kqifhk/have_you_or_anyone_you_know_had_a_near_death/,18,1609824517.0,,2021-01-05 00:28:37
Have you or anyone you know had a near death experience (ie. been clinically dead for a minute or so) and what did you/they experience in that moment?,"I had Kawasaki’s Disease when I was 2 due to my parents cleaning the carpets and my inhalation of these dust mites.  I was hospitalized for weeks and because at the time nothing was known about it, the doctors wrote me off and encouraged my parents to cut their loses and just have another kid.

Being 2 at the time, I only remember bits of what happened.  But the most vivid memory I have was feeling incredibly empowered.  There was a point where I stood up in my crib holding  the doll shaped pillow my mom had made, looking out the window and thinking how important it was to protect the people I saw walking around outside the hospital.

I managed to recover through aspirin (prevents the blood from thinning).  I later read that experiences such as these are examples of shamanic death.",10,kqifhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/kqifhk/have_you_or_anyone_you_know_had_a_near_death/,18,1609824517.0,,2021-01-05 00:28:37

I was on ECMO life support where the heart is not beating. I remember before and after the surgery but I have no memory of during the surgery, so no supernatural experience for me.

Have you or anyone you know had a near death experience (ie. been clinically dead for a minute or so) and what did you/they experience in that moment?,"In June of 2020, my Dad collapsed in our yard while helping us mow the lawn. He's an older guy, 3-time cancer survivor with dizziness issues but this was a worse fall than we'd ever seen him. He insisted to my Mom that he was fine, and that she didn't need to worry about him. We were both skeptical, but we took his word and kept a close eye on him for the rest of the day.

Fast forward to a cardiology appointment I took him to in October. He was joking with his nurse that he didn't know why he even had a pacemaker put in back in 2015 or so, since it's not like it did anything when she looked him dead in the eyes and said, ""I beg to differ.""

Turns out his collapse was a heart attack, and he flatlined. If it wasn't for the pacemaker in his chest shocking his heart back into rhythm, he would have died right then and there. The good news is they figured out where the blockage was in his heart that caused the problem, and put a stent in. So he's doing alright, all things considered.

He later admitted to my Mom and I that it felt like he was being buried. He kept trying to climb out of the pit he was in, towards a bright light, but he never could get anywhere. And then he woke up. He didn't want to tell us when it happened, because he knew we would bring him to the ER.",10,kqifhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/kqifhk/have_you_or_anyone_you_know_had_a_near_death/,18,1609824517.0,,2021-01-05 00:28:37

I developed a massive kidney infection in my other kidney. My family were told to come in twice to say goodbye to me and at one point my heart actually stopped and I was resuscitated. 

I don’t recall anything. One minute I was lying in a hospital bed, trying to make myself wee so I could go home but feeling like I had the flu or something, the next I was waking up and thinking I had been asleep for only a few minutes. It wasn’t until later on that they told me I had been in a coma and had effectively died.",10,kqifhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/kqifhk/have_you_or_anyone_you_know_had_a_near_death/,18,1609824517.0,,2021-01-05 00:28:37

Have you or anyone you know had a near death experience (ie. been clinically dead for a minute or so) and what did you/they experience in that moment?,"Yes, I  experienced nothing while ""dead"", I was already unconscious. As I was bleeding to death I remember I couldn't move, I couldn't even see. The last thing to go is hearing. I was aware I was dying but I  wasn't bothered. I was vaguely aware of bring lifted somewhere. There was what I assume was a nurse stroking my face and saying something. I don't know what he said. It was just a nice tone?
 
Then nothing

Then I was aware I was alive after all. It took a long time for me to force myself to see and hear and even think. Let alone move. It's like being the most tired ever. I was a little confused. Since I was still dangerously low on blood, I didn't really have the energy for a ""woo, I'm alive"" moment. I had arrested multiple times in the ER.

There's no bright lights, no flash backs, nothing. I can see how you might interpret the things experienced as you lost consciousness as that sort of thing.

When did you push a doctor who didn’t believe you?,"I've had terrible anxiety and stress when I was 15-16 and my abdomen started hurting so much, I would have trouble keeping down what I eat. The pain got so bad, I would even throw up after drinking water. I was already anemic and underweight but those symptoms made that matter even worse.

My doctor told me the pain and nausea is caused by my stress and was ""just in my head."" It's only after I found blood when throwing up that they figured it might be a physical issue after all.

Lo and behold, they found out - after a few days at the hospital and an endoscopy - that I had a bleeding stomach ulcer which is why ingesting anything would bring so much physical pain and discomfort.

Around 25 she started regularly having episodes of severe heart arrhythmias. So bad she fainted and seriously thought she would die (and once almost did because it happened while she was driving). Every doctor she saw told her she was just having panic attacks or was hysterically imagining things and that is wasn\`t as bad as she made it out to be, because by the time she reached the doctor the attack was over and she didn't show any signs of a heart attack in the EKGs. It took more than a dozen cardiologists and over 20 years of visiting doctors for one to finally believe her. She has Wolff-Parkinson-White-Syndrom in combination with a  disorder causing the blood to clot faster and form miniscule clots that reach the heart and trigger an attack but disolve later and can't be detected.

When did you push a doctor who didn’t believe you?,"I always had gynecological problems because of a failed surgery when i was child. Since then i had one surgery because of cysts and other stuff exactly because of that surgery. Back then, my doctor told me to be prepared for another surgery in few years, most probably when i will be 18. And there it was. The pain got back when i hit 18 and i knew it was time. I told my gynecologist that i need a surgery. She asked me why so i told her to check me. She found NOTHING. No cysts, nothing. So I believed her and i was happy like yay maybe its really over. She got me on some medication to prevent such things to even happen and sent me home.
Month later. I had to call an ambulance. Blood was rushing out of me and pain hit me like crazy. It was not my time of the month and it sure never hurt like that. Five doctors had to look at me to be sure that what they see on my sonos are cysts. There were two of them. They told me I could go on with some medication to get them smaller. I said F**K NO. I ve been in this situation on my first surgery and I knew it would not work. I immediately called my doctor to get me the f**king surgery. She did. 
Day before surgery. The head of the hospital that was supposed to do the surgery called for me and gave me a speech about risks im taking by having surgery only because of cysts. In pain that lasted for over a year i said DO IT.
Few hours after surgery. I woke up. It was like 3pm. I immediately screamed because of the pain and they had to put me to sleep again. I woke up 5pm. I got worried because the told me i would be up atleast at 1pm. Until the late evening i did not know what happened. Then the doctors show up to tell all the patients results of the surgery. Everyone except me. An hour later my doctor show up walking to me like on a funeral. What he told me? My left fallopian had rotten. Literally. Because of the first f**ked up surgery and because of a bad recovery from the second one. Also he told me they had to take care of other stuff and ofcourse the cysts because they looked really bad when the saw them from inside. And also that he is very sorry that he underestimated me.
Half a year later im recovered. Not fully, that will never be obviously but im happy its over and that the worst is behind me.

My gall bladder functionality was just at the level where if it drops below X functionality, it's never getting better.

I continued to have pain for the next year or so, after every time I ate, including anything actually healthy. I finally did a consultation with a surgeon my (nurse) uncle recommended and he at least gave me the option after seeing my paperwork. He explained that the surgery may not fix the issue entirely, but in cases like mine, it usually at least provides some amount of relief.

what’s the best memory you have with your gal friend?,"Best gal1- we had a deep heart to heart convo in her car right before I moved to another place. We were mainly talking about the future and how life would pan out now that we’re not gonna see each other all the time. We still send each other birthday gifts and greeting cards via mail, facetime at least once a month :)

Best gal2- she was often questioned about her sexuality by others and she’s a very private person, don’t think she even knew what she wanted so didn’t have anything to tell people. Her fear of judgment from family and friends grew. One random day she told me everything on her mind and it wasn’t a strict label “gay”, “bi”, “pan”, etc... I’m glad I was there to support her as she was really having a verbal conversation with herself which she felt she needed to have.

Have you ever chose to live with a medical problem over seeking care? [Serious],"I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.  I had to go to like 6 different doctors and lose 80 lbs on my own before it got diagnosed.  My endocrinologist told me to have my primary care provider give me a birth control pill with more estrogen and less progesterone.  She tried to stick me on depoprovera, which is a huge progesterone-only injection.  I didn't want to leap through the hoops any more.

So I just don't eat carbs anymore.  Most of the problems associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome are associated with insulin resistance, so if I don't eat carbs the hair, the cysts, the excess weight gain, they don't happen.  My period is only 20 days long, but it's better than the constant bleeding when I was on birth control.  My hair loss is less noticeable with a pixie cut, and I'm gay so who cares if I'm infertile anyway?  It just wasn't worth trying to fix.",9,3wy54z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/3wy54z/have_you_ever_chose_to_live_with_a_medical/,61,1450221684.0,"What sort of issue were you having?

Have you ever chose to live with a medical problem over seeking care? [Serious],"I have a cervical rib at the top of my rib cage that pinches a cluster of blood vessels and nerves in my shoulder. The whole set of messes there is called Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. From time to time, it causes me excruciating pain, I've almost blacked out a couple times just trying to raise my arm above my head. It causes poor circulation in my hands, making them cold and tingly sometimes. Repetitive movement of my arm/shoulder makes it worse, which sucks for me because most of my job involves repetitive arm/shoulder movements.

Thing is... The only real fix is surgery to remove the extra rib, which has a fairly low success rate, a very long recovery time, and a high chance for lingering pain and/or permanent nerve damage. Not only am I not willing to risk any of that, I couldn't afford to get the surgery in the first place.

So, I just put up with the pain. Several times I week, I'll have a pretty sharp pain in that area of my shoulder. Maybe once every month or two, I have a day where I'm just in tears all day and I can barely move my arm. But it's better than not being able to use my arm for six months after recovering from surgery, and risking permanent nerve damage which would probably just cause the same kind of pain anyway.",9,3wy54z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/3wy54z/have_you_ever_chose_to_live_with_a_medical/,61,1450221684.0,"What sort of issue were you having?

I live in the US, and I fall into the ""health insurance gap"". I don't qualify for the ACA, but I can't afford unsubsidized health insurance, especially since my condition is ""pre-existing"" and my premiums would be inflated due to that.

My issue started in 2003, and is chronic and degenerative, so it has only gotten worse.  I've been without treatment or pain management for over two years now.

It affects every aspect of my life. I can't be the mom I wanted to be. I can't be the partner I wish I could be. It affects everything from clothing choice to mobility limitations to not being physically able to work (I don't even get disability payments, because I was a SAHM for too many years prior to my disability).

Have you ever chose to live with a medical problem over seeking care? [Serious],"After researching for many years (yes years.. Took me about seven years after my surgery and about twelve from the time my symptoms began to affect my daily life..) I figured out the Celiac was likely responsible for my debilitating life-threatening illness when I was younger that they couldn't find the root cause for. I had surgery and blood transfusions and IV iron to treat the symptoms but the cause was never known. 

The symptoms lined up with symptoms of Celiac, which I had never considered because I thought since it affects the intestines and I don't get intestinal issues, I didn't have it. But only 1 in 3 adults gets gastrointestinal issues as a result of CD. So I stopped eating gluten. The symptoms are not present on a gluten free diet, and at the time when they were the worst, I was a vegan and eating a fair amount of pasta, bread, and seitan (which is literally wheat gluten).

I got tested for the genetic marker that is present in 98% of people with Celiac disease and I have that. Celiac only presents itself when two factors are present (like, having the marker and having been exposed to wheat before the gut barrier was fully developed; or having a relative with celiac or other autoimmune disorder and having the marker; etc) So my parents both have AI disorders and I have the marker.

The only way to definitively diagnose it is doing an endoscopy and seeing if there is any damage to the intestine. However damage starts to heal itself the minute a person stops eating gluten. So to get a definitive I would have to start eating gluten again in order to see if it damaged my intestines.

And then if it turned out I 100% have celiac, the treatment for it is... Go on a gluten-free diet....

So...I'll stick with my 80% diagnosis and forgo the pain and suffering of eating gluten for three weeks if the only result at the end is going to be them telling me ""don't do that"". I'm not going to spend $thousands for someone to tell me to do what I'm already doing",9,3wy54z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/3wy54z/have_you_ever_chose_to_live_with_a_medical/,61,1450221684.0,"What sort of issue were you having?

It's not dangerous but makes my eye looks a little bigger than the other and makes me not wear any eye make-up, both annoying. The way to get it removed is doctor injects local anesthesia around your eyes, turns your eyelid inside out, surgically removes it, and your eye stays with bandage on for a day. I already get anxious at hospitals no matter what the procedure is and calm myself down by closing my eyes during the procedure. I can't close my eyes when my eyelid is inside out. I would just see a knife coming towards my eye, which freaks me out. I've been waiting and hoping it would maybe go away on its own, apparently it happens to some people and takes 1-2 years, but it's just not going anywhere and now I'm pretty sure I have to get it removed.

Have you ever chose to live with a medical problem over seeking care? [Serious],"Celiac disease. I was not properly diagnosed because my parents didn't believe I had a problem with gluten, so I stopped on my own to show them I had a problem. Yes,  I did. Also?

I also have several food intolerances (other than gluten) but all the tests come back clear, and I'm in a considerably great shape, so pretty much the doctors tell me to keep doing what I'm doing. 

So I did seek out help, but it was pretty much useless. I checked out common gastrointestinal problems and my symptoms match none of them. That, plus the clear tests, plus the fact I'm NOT going back on gluten, pretty much had me giving up on seeking further help.

I've had docs suggest it's lupus, plus kidney issues that need more tests. I can't miss any more work. My insurance company keeps denying my claims. They want to do a series of 24-hour urine collection tests where I have to collect (and refrigerate) all my urine for 24 hours 3 or 4 times. There aren't three or four days where I spend the entire day at home, and the test is invalid if you miss any urine at all. 

Honestly, I'm exhausted even thinking about it. I just want to move to a country with universal care. A friend of mine suggested more people should start seeking asylum in universal coverage countries, and at this point, I can understand why.",9,3wy54z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/3wy54z/have_you_ever_chose_to_live_with_a_medical/,61,1450221684.0,"What sort of issue were you having?

Have you ever chose to live with a medical problem over seeking care? [Serious],"I lived with my chronically infected tonsils for YEARS until finally taking the dive and getting them taken out this past spring. 

I lived with a cracked molar for a few years as well before finally going to the dentist.

Money was always the issue. It still is as I'm making payments on the procedures. Even with good insurance. ",9,3wy54z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/3wy54z/have_you_ever_chose_to_live_with_a_medical/,61,1450221684.0,"What sort of issue were you having?

Have you ever chose to live with a medical problem over seeking care? [Serious],"Frequently. Right now I have suspected kidney stones (per a urinalysis from my gynecologist) and they huuuurt, but the urologist they referred me to costs $140 for the first visit. Shockingly, I cannot afford that. It's been going on for an undetermined period of time: I have had intermittent left lower quadrant pain for months, and very intermittent kidney/flank pain for... also for months, actually. And for the past month or so I've had a few episodes of very intense pain that lasts several hours, then it just kind of goes away. 

And once I had a bladder infection that just wouldn't go away, so I eventually went to the doctor and got antibiotics. Well, they didn't work, so it still hurt to pee and I was also getting this weird back pain I didn't recognize. So I waited several hours while in excruciating pain, then eventually went downstairs and told my mom. She got me some AZO, but by the time she got back I was crying hysterically and we ended up just going to the ER. Had a kidney infection. 

Oh, and I had depression for yeeeears before I did anything about it. I was just too embarrassed to talk about it. Made my life a living hell and made me want to kill myself. Honestly, it was the worst of the three. Not really sure why I let that go on so long.

Have you ever chose to live with a medical problem over seeking care? [Serious],"I leave my OCD untreated because I have coping techniques that seem to be keeping it under control. 


My lupus is also untreated because the medicine I used to treat it started destroying my retinas, and my current doctor doesn't think I'm sick enough to try any other meds. It's pretty awful. I feel like shit 24/7 now, but there's nothing I can do.",9,3wy54z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/3wy54z/have_you_ever_chose_to_live_with_a_medical/,61,1450221684.0,"What sort of issue were you having?

Have you ever chose to live with a medical problem over seeking care? [Serious],"I chose to live with my OCD for years rather than seeking help.

I mostly chose to not seek help as I was scared of being judged, not taken seriously, I felt like I deserved it and I didn't have the money for it.

I didn't realise it until it became severe, but I've always had OCD. It kind of remained in the background until I went through some really traumatic things. I didn't seek help for these things so the trauma manifested in my OCD and it went from 1 to 1000. After seeking therapy, I have reasonable control over my OCD but I don't believe I'll ever be rid if it, so to answer your question I guess it lasts forever.

It affected my life in every way imaginable. At my worst, I was taking 18 hour showers. That left little to no time for anything else, including eating and sleeping. I did some serious and lasting damage to my skin and hair by washing with bleach and domestos. Everyone around me felt helpless and helplessness is often expressed through anger, so the angrier they got, the more I fell apart inside. I experienced thoughts so vulgar and grotesque that I would actually have the urge to wash my mind with bleach. I would have to scrimp and save every cent I could and borrow money so I could afford the amount of soap I was using. I was housebound for a while. It crept into absolutely everything.",9,3wy54z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/3wy54z/have_you_ever_chose_to_live_with_a_medical/,61,1450221684.0,"What sort of issue were you having?

Have you ever chose to live with a medical problem over seeking care? [Serious],"I have IBS. It has been apparent since I was about 4 or 5, yet I only got medical treatment for it when I was 23. Mainly because I just learned to live with it, and dealt with it no matter how bad it got. 

I only ended up getting treated because I met my SO and after a few months of seeing me in so much pain he managed to persuade me to go to the doctor. I now have medication and pain relief, so all is good.",9,3wy54z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/3wy54z/have_you_ever_chose_to_live_with_a_medical/,61,1450221684.0,"What sort of issue were you having?

Have you ever chose to live with a medical problem over seeking care? [Serious],"I broke my tailbone when I was 10 or 11. I remember getting X-rays, but for some reason, nothing was ever done about it. The bone is broken, jammed upwards, and displaced to the side--you can literally see and feel the bone sticking out above my butt. I'm 24 now and still have pain when sitting or laying down, on long car rides, etc. My legs lose feeling and fall asleep from sitting and even going to the bathroom can cause a feeling of pressure pushing at me from the inside. For some reason, doctors just haven't seemed concerned about it at all...",9,3wy54z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/3wy54z/have_you_ever_chose_to_live_with_a_medical/,61,1450221684.0,"What sort of issue were you having?

Have you ever chose to live with a medical problem over seeking care? [Serious],"Recently I went through strep without seeking help from a doctor.  My reasoning behind this is simply that I am severely allergic to the antibiotics used in treating strep and thus visiting the doctor would have been a waste of time and money.  

I have a cyst in my shin (this is something that was found by a doctor when I was much younger) that has been hurting.  Looking up the type of cyst tells me that pain is common and untreatable. 

The last issue is that I'm fairly certain that I have endometriosis.  It would explain the excessive pain, the significant blood loss each month, and honestly the scarring the ultrasound tech found when I was pregnant with my son (he had asked if I had several miscarriages of which I had had none). I am unable to take BC with estrogen and from what I understand that's  a big part of treatment.  Plus, I just really hate going to the doctor.
