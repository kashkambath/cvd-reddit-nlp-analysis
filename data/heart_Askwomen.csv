"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","When I was 14 I badly sprained my ankle. I told my mum it really hurt but she said it’s just a sprain, the hospital won’t be able to do anything. So I just rode it out. 

She was always weirdly against going to hospital, and we live in the UK so it wasn’t a cost thing. I think she just didn’t want to waste their time. 

Anyway long story short my foot was never right after that, and it was only 20 years later I had a proper MRI and they found that when I sprained my foot, I snapped a ligament, and a piece of bone went with it, and it’s never healed. So essentially I’m missing the support of a ligament that should be there. They could have repaired it at the time but not now. 

My mum is the most awesome mum in all other ways so this event especially bewilders me. Like... just take me to hospital. That’s what they’re there for. Oh well :/",2531,knruu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/knruu6/what_is_that_situation_of_your_life_where_you/,1027,1609457110.0,Because they could have easily helped but didn't.,2020-12-31 18:25:10
"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","When I was 22 and fresh out of college, my parents decided to take me off the family cell phone plan. 

I'd moved out to the dorm at 17 and had paid my own way on all my bills since. The only bill that I didn't have full responsibility for was my cell phone. It was 2008 and I'd just graduated, and I was struggling to find work to support myself. My rent -- with a roommate -- was $355/month and my main job paid $400/month, so I was supplementing my income with various gigs, selling any personal possessions I didn't need, etc just to afford utilities, and my grocery budget was only $15/week so I often only ate one meal a day. 

My parents were in poverty too, so they couldn't afford to help pay my bills or anything like that, and they were struggling in their own way. In order to save money, they decided because I was an adult they'd kick me off the family phone plan.

I broke down when my mom told me. I begged her not to. Doing it would save them a whopping $20/month, and it would force me to spend an extra $55-75/month that I didn't have. Of course I offered to pay them my portion of the bill - just keep me on the family plan! I'll give you my share of it every month! But because I was *an adult* they dumped me anyway.

My mom likes to brag to her friends about how resourceful I was during that time period, how I hustled and pushed in order to survive. Every time I hear her talking about it, I want to break down, even 10+ years later, because all I remember is being miserable, terrified, and hungry. She also doesn't know that part of how I ""hustled"" to survive at that time was by getting into sex work for a few months, and a big part of why I had to start doing that was because of that sudden extra monthly bill I couldn't afford to pay.",2531,knruu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/knruu6/what_is_that_situation_of_your_life_where_you/,1027,1609457110.0,Because they could have easily helped but didn't.,2020-12-31 18:25:10
"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","I wet my pants once in public because of my mother. I'm still upset about it

Edit* (full story)

We're out shopping for school clothes and I have to use the bathroom, I was about 11-12ish . I let my mother know I needed to pee and she says she'll find a bathroom after we try on these pants first.  I wasn't super desperate while we were still finding clothes so I held it.  Fast forward about 5 minutes its feeling more urgent and er are just starting to head into the dessing room. I was hoping there was a bathroom in ther that I could quickly bolt to and then try on the pants.  We were clothes shopping for school.

We get to the dressing area and I'm fidgety and there's no bathroom back there.  I ask again to use the bathroom and i am again told I could hold it and we go into a dressing room.  I start trying on pants. I am visibly fidgety and doing the pee pee dance between pairs. I am verbally telling my mother I have to use the bathroom and I am trying to be quiet about my desperation.  I'm grabbing myself at this point, we try on the last pair I can't even stand still so she can see if they fit me or not.

I know I don't have time to make it to the bathroom s I am pulling up my pants to leave the dressing room. I contemplate literally squatting and peeing in the dressing room. We walk out to try to find a dressing room, she doesn't ask the dressing room attendant and I'm begging her to tell me where a bathroom is and then.... hissing sound and the strongest spurt of pee of my life squirts out of my pants. I'm mortified, humiliated and frozen from the force...I couldn't hold it and begin to cry while I piss myself in front of about 6 people in this outlet dressing room. Im looking at my mom and crying she's just standing there watching me pee my pants and now she's crying saying sorry.

I dont even remember walking out of the dressing room and going to a nearby Wendy's to dry my pants and underwear either the paper towel in thr bathroom.  My mother didn't bring me new clothes even though we were out clothes shopping, nope she just had me dry off to thr best of my abilities and we proceeded to shop for hours and even do lunch before we went home. I'm still upset about this situation its been almost 20 years.",2531,knruu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/knruu6/what_is_that_situation_of_your_life_where_you/,1027,1609457110.0,Because they could have easily helped but didn't.,2020-12-31 18:25:10
"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","I’ve had periods of depression since approximately 13/14ish. I was labeled a moody teenager with anger issues. My parents joke that I was such a happy young kid and don’t know what happened...like did you not think further about a huge change in attitude and behavior. Mental health discussions weren’t as common when I was that age (publicly or privately).

I was sexually assaulted in the same month, lost my virginity shortly after to a guy who gave me a bad UTI and cheated on me with my best friend.

I ended up completely coming apart at urgent care, sobbing in the waiting room for hours, crying so hard I had people asking me if something else was going on. This is when they decided to tell me that they were finalizing the divorce. They didn't really ask what was wrong and they were never there for me after that.

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","My teenage years.  My sister died when I was a preteen/teenage and I was the only girl except my mother in a house full of boys.  I was suddenly the painful reminder.

So I went the opposite direction of my sister so I was not that painful reminder.  Kinda went into bad directions because my sister was so much on the good side of things.

My mother(and to a lesser extent my dad) could have stepped in and paid attention to me being good rather than just when I got in trouble.  But....it was rare I did something even remotely like my sister and got praise.  I quit choir even though I loved it.  I quit track.  I got in trouble at school.  I stopped getting good grades after I saw my mother crying over my report card in junior high when I got the same score as my sister in her favorite class. I got brought home by the cops instead of always following the rules.

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","2 of my 3 siblings were adopted, as well as myself. My younger sister and I were adopted from birth but my older sister was in foster care for a few years before being adopted by our parents. She was pretty messed up from abusive family members and neglectful foster parents(not mine obviously). She was almost constantly violent, screaming, and just generally abusive to me, my younger sister, and my parents. Because I wasn't the baby sibling, she usually targeted me: threw me down the stairs, splashed boiling water on me, and even slammed my arm in a door and broke it. 

My parents really did their best to keep us all safe but I wish they had cut their losses and gave her back to the state or something. I have been diagnosed with PTSD and occasionally have nightmares and will go into an instant panic attack in situations of screaming and anger. She's just as dysfunctional and awful as an adult so it's not like adopting her did any good for her. I don't talk to her unless I'm forced to as holidays. The only resentment I harbor is for her directly and I know that my parents just thought they were doing the right thing.",2531,knruu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/knruu6/what_is_that_situation_of_your_life_where_you/,1027,1609457110.0,Because they could have easily helped but didn't.,2020-12-31 18:25:10

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","Being super depressed in my teenage years. I was a pretty unpleasant person to be around at times because of the depression, but I wish my mum had been bit more mature and supported me more, rather than taking my terseness, lack of motivation and sensitivity as personally as she did. My depression was made so much worse because she was preoccupied with the effects it had on her and was v reactionary and never asked about my mental state.

I've grown a LOT since then. While I still get depressed, I no longer see myself as ""an unpleasant person"" or ""too sensitive"", because I know those are just signs I'm not feeling resilient bc of my depression flaring up and not something I should hate myself for. 

I did all of that growth by myself once I was independent enough to seek out medical intervention for myself; it was never discussed with parents. A big part of developing compassion for myself was developing a critical view of my parents' behaviour during that time, and then having empathy with them and being able to let those resentments go. 

Browsing r/raisedbynarcissists did nothing but keep me angry and bitter and cause more arguments between myself and my parents (I don't think I'm the target audience of that sub, tbh, my parents weren't bad enough) but reading the book *Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents* really did help. It wasn't their fault, but it wasn't mine either, and they definitely made it harder at times. Overall I'm grateful for the experience, and if I ever get to have children it will inform the way I raise them.",2531,knruu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/knruu6/what_is_that_situation_of_your_life_where_you/,1027,1609457110.0,Because they could have easily helped but didn't.,2020-12-31 18:25:10
"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","There are some things I openly and actively blame them for because my childhood suuuucked but the one I don't really talk about is that I never learned any kind of reasonable work ethic. My role models were:

- My mother, who went on disability very early in a progressive illness (MS) and *immediately* stopped doing any work, parenting, housework, meaningful hobbies, etc. She sat around the house all day and got waited on hand and foot by adults who didn't want to (and TBF, back then, probably didn't know they *should*) push her to try. Or, say, get therapy. 

- My father, who worked like crazy *and* took on all of the parenting duties, plus a lot of responsibilities for other family members like my grandmothers, and was pretty clearly stressed and unhappy a lot of the time.

Those examples + the fact that I was smart enough to sail easily through school meant that the real world absolutely *clobbered* me after graduation. I still really struggle to, like, put actual effort into things I don't want to do / that don't come easily. And ironically, it's even worse now that I'm also disabled.",2531,knruu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/knruu6/what_is_that_situation_of_your_life_where_you/,1027,1609457110.0,Because they could have easily helped but didn't.,2020-12-31 18:25:10
"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","I started puberty early - 9 or 10, which actually I don’t think is that weird. I ended up having to go for regular goal it am visits and getting puberty blockers injected every couple of months. I had to go for really intrusive tests that involved doctors checking my pubic hair growth, MRI scans, lots of blood taken. I was always a weird kid but generally alright even if I was an oddball. I thought of this time of my life earlier and almost cried - I was fine, it was adults treating me like I was a freak, or different that really effected me. I felt violated but didn’t really know how to express that at the time. The medication made me gain weight and I got bullied for that as a result, I went on to develop recurrent episodes of anorexia and whilst it’s under control now, I don’t imagine my issues with food will ever go away. I wish my mum had never done this, when I think to when I started becoming I unhappy, when my life became miserable and chaotic I can trace it back to feelings at that time. I lost control, I felt like I wasn’t in control of my life. It took me until mid 20’s to really get my mental health under control but I genuinely feel I’ve been robbed of so many years, robbed of the ability to function fully as a young adult and each my potential. Of course there were other factors at play, and other events exacerbated my inner turmoil subsequently but i wonder if they would have happened otherwise.

Sorry for the rant - for years I told no one about this because I was ashamed. I’m glad to have had the chance o get it out there. My mum was trying to do the best for me but I don’t think I 9 year old can really consent to unnecessary medical treatment.",2531,knruu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/knruu6/what_is_that_situation_of_your_life_where_you/,1027,1609457110.0,Because they could have easily helped but didn't.,2020-12-31 18:25:10

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","My mom was abusive when I was growing up. Generally it was only verbally (but that was worse- she told me I was a burden, that nobody would want a daughter like me, that I was ugly and evil, etc), but on two occasions she snapped and started choking me. Once was when I was 7. She also threw my head on concrete, when I was about 7 or 8. 

She has untreated borderline personality disorder. Her brother violently abused her and her mom ignored it. Honestly, maybe I’m just projecting because I love her and we have a better relationship now (she’s gotten a lot better with age, it’s mellowed her out significantly now that she’s past menopause), but I blame my uncle and grandma for how they made my mom this way. My uncle is my godfather and I hate that he is. I feel repulsed whenever I see him, even though he’s “changed.” The shitty thing is he’s now a great, non-abusive husband and father. He just abused his own vulnerable little sister. I don’t hate anyone but I come close to hating him.

My dad had to work long hours because my mom is disabled (bad osteoarthritis since she was 40) and needed to make money for the house, and he had to move to Texas for a while to keep his job.

Eventually I got old enough to use the fitting room on my own, but like a trained animal, I would stand sideways, frown into the mirror, and call myself fat.

I can't think of a time in my life when I truly loved my body. I've always had a potbelly, even before I was clinically overweight. Now I'm just getting bigger and sadder. I even dipped my toe into bulimia earlier this year. I'm not sure if I will ever NOT feel fat and gross.

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","I began suffering heavily from generalized anxiety and depression when I was 9yo.   

By the time I was 10 it was impacting my school attendance and I was vomiting daily.   

By 11 I was chronically late to school because I was vomiting for hours every morning, and the ever present nausea made it so I was eating only 1 meal a day (dinner).   

When I was 12 I went to high school and insomnia was added to the mix. Now I was lucky to get one full meal in, AND i was averaging 1-2 hours of sleep a night on school nights.  

I ended up having a psychotic break 3 months before the end of grade 8. I was 5'3"" and weighed less than 100lb.

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","There was never any money for me to go to the doctor. There was always plenty for my older brother, no matter what was going on with him. Surgeries, consultations, specialists, medications, lab work. If he needed it, he got it. 

I wasn't diagnosed with epilepsy until I had seizures in front of *his* neurologist. 

I've struggled lifelong with anxiety, depression, ptsd, epilepsy, gastrointestinal issues (these debilitate me), joint pain, and fatigue. I don't have a personality. I'm just a trauma response.

But her motherly care came in the form of, ""Okay, it's time to be done being sick. You're just doing this for attention."" Didn't matter if it was the stomach flu, mononucleosis, or injury. Same treatment. I'm pretty sure if I had been bleeding internally she'd have argued there wasn't anything wrong because she didn't see anything and I was ""so dramatic"".

Now I'm a chronically ill adult that no doctor will take seriously because I've been struggling since childhood but there's no record of it. 

Money was tight while I was growing up. It was hard, and I won't just gloss over that. We lived in poverty for the first 14 years of my life.

Still, though, my mother made sure I knew that his health was more important than mine, because he got every scrap of help he could wish for, and I generally got none. I guess I just had the rotten luck of being an accidental (and apparently unwanted) second pregnancy eight years later.

I realized then that I could never trust her with my feelings. My dad at least tried, even if he didn't understand. 

Their culture doesn't believe in mental health so to a degree I see why I shouldn't blame them, but for the love of god how does another adult tell you that your child tried to kill themselves and your response is essentially ""hmm.... sounds like a lie"" instead of ""how can I help my child""",2531,knruu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/knruu6/what_is_that_situation_of_your_life_where_you/,1027,1609457110.0,Because they could have easily helped but didn't.,2020-12-31 18:25:10

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","I suffered severe injuries as a child during a horrific car accident. Multiple broken bones, brain bleed, coma. By a miracle, I recovered. And after months of rehab, I healed so rapidly that I was able to return to a fairly normal life. On the outside, no one could really tell what I had survived through.

But brain injuries are strange and terrible things. At the time, things like PTSD and ADHD were not as well understood as they are now, so no one could explain to my parents or child me that I would now experience crippling emotions, flashbacks, memory problems., and disconnectedness...for the rest of my life.

My parents are the best kind of people and I love them. But they are military, and of the mindsets “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” and “pain is weakness leaving the body”, and “A’s are for average.” I can remember struggling to keep up in high school because of short term memory loss issues. My parents lovingly told me that “you can’t use your brain injury as a crutch.” Like WTF?!
And struggling with the flashbacks...their sage advice was to “think about something else”. It doesn’t work like that...
And when I would struggle with depression, they kindly encouraged me to “be strong because we can’t afford therapy.” Lol.
I am grateful for how well my parents raised me, and that we have a good, strong relationship. But I am doubly grateful to have moved away and to have found a wonderful partner who actually understands my struggles, and helps me through them instead of ignoring or invalidating them.

My dad gave me his best of a sex talk once when I was 10 and that's it, they never talked about sex and I ended up teaching my mom a lot more about her own body when I was older. 

So...they just grew up in a very misogynistic world view with very little knowledge about sex. But also, that wasn't my problem as a kid. My mom was raped. She should known what it was like for young women to be harassed and assaulted and no one to believe them. She could have also just been projecting which is again, not my problem.

But this year (in 2018) my mom was going through treatment for lung cancer. She had at this point stopped all treatment and decided to live out the rest of her months as peaceful as possible. We came to the conclusion that it wouldn’t be a good idea for her to go, she just wasn’t doing well and the idea of being far away from the hospital etc was scary. So we all decided to stay home. My dad kept mentioning how we invited people up for the weekend, therefore if I was planning on staying with my mom he still wanted to go so that they wouldn’t lose out completely. My mom of course feeling guilty, told him it was fine and to go.

I didn’t have a good feeling about it, and I even asked my dad “what if something happens?” And he assured me everything would be okay. So I was home with her alone, Friday and Saturday and honestly I’m glad I got to spend that quality time together. We went through old photo albums together, and watched tv together. But it broke my heart that even my mom questioned my dads actions. Yeah, she didn’t want to feel guilty so she said it was fine. But she still asked me if that was you, and your wife wasn’t doing well, would you have left? And I said no. It broke my heart that she felt that way. 

Saturday night she became unresponsive. I had to call my dad and brother, and frantically tell them I thought she was dying and that they needed to come home. I had to call 911. Thankfully the EMTs stayed with me until the hospice nurse showed up because I already was absolutely panicking dealing with this all alone. 

Of course as soon as my dad got home he apologized profusely. And on another day, weeks after broke down crying and saying how guilty he felt about it. I forgave him. But part of me still holds on to it, because it was the worst day of my life and I shouldn’t have had to go through that alone, and because of what my mom had said to me.

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","I’ve always been the “easy” one. I argued less, I don’t have anxiety, I didn’t sneak out, I slept well, I was agreeable, I was nice, I did sweet things for everyone. As such, I definitely had an easier childhood than my siblings. My parents were nicer to me (I’m also the youngest; I watched my siblings try to fight my parents for more autonomy/better conditions, and saw it never work out; I learned from that). 

In reality, I did have anxiety. I snuck out ALL the time. I internalize stress. I’m sneaky, because I just learned how to lie REAL well. I have horrible communication skills. I had to actively cultivate empathy instead of just being nice to people as a self-preservation/lightly manipulative tactic. I don’t feel like I can share when something is wrong because I’m the level-headed one in the family. 

I was so terrified of any kind of communication with my parents that I didn’t even tell my mom when I had my first period for three whole years. I just dealt with it myself (no easy feat when you live in rural America and don’t have a job or even access to a grocery store). 

Everyone comes to me if there’s an issue because they know I won’t freak out. But I don’t have a safe place. I feel a lot of pressure to make my parents happy because they have strained relationships with my other two siblings (one of whom is just straight up a narcissist who I’m no contact with), and I know if makes them sad. 

I also feel a lot of pressure among my siblings (even the one I don’t speak to) to be okay all the time. They both had much harder childhoods than I did, and we talk about that often. I feel bad even bringing up any of my issues because they had it so much harder. The reality is, though, that I still had an absolutely wild childhood and how could I POSSIBLY escape from it unscathed?

A lot of it is on my parents because we didn’t have a safe, happy childhood. My parents had god-awful childhoods and were absolutely doing their very best, and I recognize that so I don’t blame them, but I really wish I had been taught better communication as a kid.

We left the city and house I loved deeply and moved to a majority white (we were a mixed family), aggressively Conservative area. The constant onslaught of bullying I experienced in my new school (I was being beat up at least weekly by boys on the school baseball team for looking like a ""lesbo"") led me to attempt suicide twice. I know my dad had to make a huge decision about the financial livelihood of his family vs their emotional livelihood, but thinking about the terror I experienced that first year in a new school (until I grew my hair out and began dressing more feminine) still haunts me. I made a decision that if I ever had a partner or a family, I would do everything I could to ensure their happiness and stability before listening to the asks of employers and to seek workplaces where work rarely overtakes one's personal life (on a side note, it was a difficult search, but I finally found a great, woman run company that believes that).

During winter break of my senior year, my ex and I just broke up and I was so sad and depressed. I really turned into myself and didn’t want to interact with anyone. I asked my parents to just please let me be and leave me alone. I just didn’t have the mental energy to put up a front and try to be happy. 

Not only would they refuse my request, they constantly badgered me to talk to them, do things with them, and basically anything that made people happy (not saying people shouldn’t be happy around the holidays or anything but seeing people happy made me even more depressed and I felt that it was better to remove myself than to make these situation sour). 

It basically to the point where my parents cornered me at dinner one night with questions and just making me feel bad about myself. I’m already a pretty private person to my parents, so they had to force out of me that my ex and I broke up.

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","I grew up in an abusive household, so...so many things.  But let me just explain one (because it's still a problem).

Growing up, I was sick to my stomach all of the time.  Vomiting, runny stools, ect.  Eventually, she took me to the doctor to figure out what was wrong (after BEGGING for years).  I was diagnosed with lactose intolerance and told to do a food elimination diet so that I could pinpoint foods that made me ill.  Turns out I can't eat dairy, red meat, and a few other random things.

WELL, growing up my mom was in denial.  Even though the doctor told me that I couldn't eat dairy or red meat (via the elimination diet), my mom did not care.  She would make red meat/dairy dishes every night for dinner (if she would cook at all).  If I wouldn't eat it then I would not get food.  If I did eat it I would vomit.  I lost a ton of weight and got very skinny.

As an adult, she still does this.  When I go over there she doesn't have options for me, or will prepare food telling me that I can eat it...only to then add something that I clearly cannot eat.  She thinks it's a big joke and hilarious.

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","I've long suspected I have autism but getting help as an adult was more difficult than I thought (and involved an extremely dismissive doctor who thought being autistic was just ""trendy"" nowadays). I also tried therapy while in uni and it was freely available, the therapist was also pretty dismissive and kept trying to get me to practice mindfulness rather than anything that might have helped me. I gave up on help.
 

I was talking to my mum last year and the topic of a young family member who was just diagnosed with autism came up. She briefly mentioned how she always thought I had autism when I was growing up, and then the conversation moved on. 

Internally I was screaming! Why not get me help?! Why not mention this to me?! Why not do anything other than ignore it?! 

She had a lot on her plate. She was a single mother with not a lot of money, working a hard minimum wage job. The doctors probably wouldn't have helped anyway.

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","When I was 14 my mom thought it was time for a ""proper"" relationship with a boy (I was not a virgin or new to dating but she felt I needed to settle down). She introduced me to the ""son of a friend of a friend's cousin"".  She said he was 18 or 19 but looked older cuz he had gone through a hormonal imbalance early in his teen years.  She basically made me swear to never bring up his age or mine as it was a ""sensitive issue"".

So we meet.  He was actually an amazing person.  I felt listened to and respected for the first time in my life. We of course ended up in a relationship and had sex and wouldn't ya know my stupid teenage ass got pregnant.  My mom was ecstatic.

I gave birth to my 1st child at 15yo.  2 months later I was pregnant again (we only even had sex once around 7-8 weeks post party and it was not pleasant).  My mother had told me it was impossible to get pregnant while breast feeding. Wrong. 
I gave birth to twins (b/g) a few days b4 my 16th bday.  6 months later I lost my son to a medical issue (prefer not to say as it tends to upset ppl), and I barely made it through.

By my 17th bday I was pregnant again (antibiotics messed with my b/c).  B/f proposed..I accepted..
Now this is where all hell breaks loose (as if the other stuff was a walk in the park lol). He wanted to get married before the baby was born and before I was too big to fit into my dress (I had made my own dress from old dresses I bought from thrift stores).  At this point I was not speaking with my mother due to an unrelated issue.  But to be married before I turned 18 i would need her permission/signature. I mentioned in passing to him that i would rather wait so i didn't need to involve her, and by the time I didn't need her permission I would be too big to fit in my dress.  He didn't understand.  I realized I messed up but then figured ""hey..we have been together almost 4 yrs,  we have 3 kids and one on the way, and we are about to be married.  Im sure mentioning ages can't be that bad....right?""

Oh. My. God.  It was beyond bad.  I basically told him to just wait til after my 18th bday and he effin lost it.  Well, first he laughed and said ""what?"", then he went white as a ghost and started crying and saying he's going to jail, and how he must be sick or blind (mostly talking to himself).  I was beyond hurt but i tried to comfort him and said not to worry.. a 3-4 yr age difference is nothing.  He asked me how old I thought he was...I told him my mom told me he was 18 when we met so he can't be older than 22.  He started crying again and said ""I'm fucking 28 years old.  I made babies  with a baby."" He then up and left

Besides losing my son that was the hardest time in my life.  It turned out my mother told her friend of a friends cousin that I was 20!! But I had such a baby face and hated anyone bringing up my age or bday.  

My mom knew his age.  She set her 14yo daughter up with a 24 yo man.  Her defense ""what does it matter, you worked out didn't you?"" UGH!!!

Just so u know the story does have a happy ending.  We went to couples counseling for a year.  We got married. That was all over 20 yrs ago and we now have 3 more beautiful daughters and a wonderful life together.  My mom was diagnosed with depression and underwent years of therapy.

My theory as to why she didn't get me birth control was because I had expressed early on that I wanted to join the military at some point, and she was totally against it.

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","I was a really sassy, bubbly kid up until I turned 8. When I was 8, I was sexually abused by my uncle’s nephew and from then on I became very introverted, depressed, just a blue kid. I used to love being a kid, doing kid stuff, then I kind of became closed off. I didn’t know how to cope with what I was feeling as I was growing up. I went through a phase where I gained a lot of weight because I started eating my emotions - that was how I started to cope. My mom has always been petite and very feminine. I wasn’t. I would wear baggy clothes and things that hid my body and my mother hated it. She hated that I was gaining weight and that I wasn’t as girly as she was. She’d try to motivate me to work out but her way of motivating me was by pointing out all my flaws. Whenever I’d grab a snack she’d make comments about my weight and how no one would want to date a chubby girl, things like that. I grew to resent her and I hated myself for it. It was until I was 16 that I tried to commit suicide because I felt like I couldn’t handle the burden of living a life like I was - carrying all those feelings and memories with no one to tell and the feeling of disappointing my mother by not being the daughter she wanted me to be. My parents found me just in time and I came clean to them. My mother apologized and still does to this day. I’m not mad at her for what happened to me when I was 8, but I look back at those years where I gained weight (preteen) and can’t help but think how miserable I was and how much kinder my mother could’ve been. Maybe I wouldn’t have tried to do what I did. I don’t necessarily think I blame her for anything, but I look back at my childhood with sadness and I wish that my mother could’ve been there for me and noticed how her daughter went from being a ray of sunshine to a rain cloud.

I’m not sure, and am doing some research and planning to bring it up with my doctor, but... god, i’m frustrated that they never REALLY looked in to it when i was younger because it could’ve explained a lot and saved me a lot of trouble if i’d potentially gotten treatment for it earlier!

I don’t blame my parents for “having ADHD” (if i do have it”), but it kills me that they heard a therapist say one thing, the pediatrician said “nope”, and then they just... left it at that!

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","I had an undiagnosed disability called ehlers danlos syndrome that nobody acknowledged until I was 21 and finally got it diagnosed.  

I told my mom over and over how much pain I was in and she and my father told me I was a liar.  I had so many of the symptoms formally diagnosed as a kid but she didn’t believe I could have something causing them all, and she would be sympathetic for periods of time and then when it annoyed her it wasn’t real.  At doctors appointments there was so much concern and I was just like “who is this person and where was she yesterday when I was crying and couldn’t go to class?”

They knew I had scoliosis from the time I was born, but they didn’t want to do the less invasive stuff for it when I was a kid.  Because of that I had to get a back brace later and spinal fusion after that because it progressed so much a brace couldn’t stop it.  Despite having rods in my back they didn’t think I should be in any pain after that, and they said I was lying and my dad called me spoiled (for getting medical procedures done??).  My dad still makes fun of me for being in pain sometimes and my mom doesn’t do anything about it.

I didn’t expect anything better from my dad but I used to from my mom.  I can’t blame anybody for having an illness but I think I’d be in better shape now if I had more caring parents.  I’m 22 and I’ve ground the discs below my rods to nothing, not sure what I’m going to do about that.  Maybe none of this would have been an issue if they took me to physical therapy as a kid.

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","My brother. He's depressed, has a gaming addiction, and definitely has something else wrong - OCD? Anxiety? Narcissism? I guess we'll never know.

He failed out of high school twice, and now university once. He's never had a job and takes no responsibility for himself or his actions, and has no concerns or compassion for other people at all. He's not even aware enough of other people to not slam doors in the house at 3AM, every godforsaken night because he's up all night playing video games and then says he has a ""headache"" so he can sleep through the day. He lies through his teeth that he's doing his school work and doing great, and then has a complete mental breakdown at the end of the semester because, surprise, turns out for the fifth year in a row he's done no work and just lied the whole time. 

My mum enables him and refuses to force him to get treatment, it's been five years and he hasn't been in therapy, hasn't taken his medication regularly, she acts like his best friend not his parent and won't let my dad or I intervene. She does everything for him, from waking him up so he doesn't have to set an alarm, cooking, his laundry, driving (he's never gotten a license), even picking his dirty clothes off the floor. I've told her for years he is not going to get better if he doesn't go to treatment and she does everything for him. 

I get that he's sick. I've been depressed. I have an anxiety disorder. I get it. (I went to treatment, to therapy, I take my medication.) But at the end of the day he doesn't want to get help because she enables him. Why would you want to do your own chores and get a job and take responsibility for your life if someone else could do everything for you? 

At this point my biggest worry is about my own future. I've told her that him living with me is a hard boundary and he is not welcome to do that, ever. I feel like an ass because he'll be on the street if anything happens to my parents but I refuse to be like my mum, I'm not his mother or his wife and I will not be put in that situation. But when they're gone it will be my responsibility whether I like it or not. Whatever happens to him will be my fault because it'll be my choice that puts him there.

When I was 12-13 my mom (single, raising myself and my brother) decided her 40s was a great time to pick up a crack addiction. I’m not going to touch on addiction being a disease because I know the science but my feelings have their own opinion and I recognize those are based on trauma and pain. ANYWAY. My brother and I moved in with my dad and stepmom. We had just spent the last year watching the only involved parent we really had lose her job and take the (both fast and slow) downward spiral into hard drug addiction. By the time we moved out of there the house was being foreclosed on, there wasn’t any food, and the power and water had been shut off multiple times. I had been taking care of myself almost entirely for months. I knew my parent wasn’t reliable and my house wasn’t safe. I had started locking my bedroom door at night because the friends she brought around scared me. 


What I truly do not understand is why, when my dad and stepmom got us, I wasn’t put in therapy. I realize now I was hella traumatized, and then further traumatized by being yanked out of a situation where I had nearly full control over my daily decisions to a house where all of that control was taken from me. That sense of control was the only thing I could cling to during that time and then I was uprooted and stripped of it. I was a very angry teenager after that. 


I’m not in therapy for the last five ish years and I’ve even asked my dad that question. He said he was focused on giving me a safe physical place to live, like the hierarchy of needs. I couldn’t help but point out the base physical safety was met the day I moved in with them, and then it felt like nothing was done to further address any of it after that.

TRIGGER WARNING FOR VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 

Context: When I was 13 I was raped by one of my exes. We had been been “dating”, and that whole time he pressured me to have sex with him and let him touch me and I stood my ground, no. After our breakup, he came over to my house on his bike and asked to speak with me about our break up. I shouldn’t have let him in at all, but I was home alone, and he raped me. He went around bragging to mutual friends that he finally got to screw me, and that’s when these friends asked for my side and started telling higher-ups in the school. CPS was called to my house and that’s when my mom found out. 

My mom thought it was consensual. I told her I didn’t want it and he had hurt me, I don’t know why but I think she too assumed that since we had “dated” it was consensual. She then punished me, took away my electronics in a time when I needed support, banned me from going out at all when I needed it most. And at his house, he wasn’t punished even though he was the one who did wrong. I had everything taken away from me and for weeks I sat in my room with nothing and cried. My mom made me go into a CVS sobbing with her and ask the lady to get me a plan B. She said she was embarrassed and wanted to move away because of her “whore daughter”. People at school took his side as well and started calling me a whore and a slut at school, it was hell there and at home. My mom eventually apologized and said that if I was raped, she didn’t go about it right. I told her it was fine, but I don’t feel fine about it and never have. 

I know they were just angry, but I’m quite a bit older and wiser now. I know they were trying to do what’s best for me and punish me as they had thought I’d done wrong, I did let this guy into my home knowing he was bad news. But they still punished me and kept me away from support I needed. They did get me therapy afterwards, which helped significantly, but I still suffer from horrible anxiety and trust issues. Low-self esteem too. It’s been almost 3 years and I still can’t think of my mom in the same light or create new relationships easily.

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","Being sexual abused by my uncle and I’m pretty sure by my older brother too and most of the neighborhood boys. I have barely any memory of my childhood but sometimes things will trigger certain memories of my childhood. I also have vague memories of my upstairs neighbor attempting to do things to me.

Even if I didn't like it, even if I wasn't hungry. I would ask to go to the bathroom and spit food into the toilet. I wasn't allowed to leave the table until I ate everything.

I developed disordered eating in high school due to my weight and still struggle with that too.

I know my parents didn't grow up with much and they didn't want to waste food, I know they never meant to cause me problems and would be horrified to realize how deeply those actions have affected me.

I should be more like my sister
I am smarter than_______
You don’t have the brains of a piss ant 
ADD which no one knew
I was berated for being shy

So many things were hell, and she was always a bitter angry woman.  But she doesn’t remember that stuff.  It would only break her heart.  I have to understand the circumstances and forgive.

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","I always knew that something bad had happened to me when I was young, I just couldn’t remember what. I had all these questions, all these feelings, and I didn’t understand them. I would ask my mother about it, and she would tell me to stop worrying, to get it off my mind, I had a normal childhood, I had a normal birth, I hit all my developmental milestones normally, case closed. When that wasn’t enough for me, she made a point to tell everyone I was just being an attention seeker, that I was lying, that I shouldn’t be taken seriously, I’m just being manipulative, etc etc...

Well imagine my surprise when I turned 18 and was able to look at my records. I did indeed go through some horrible stuff that I couldn’t remember, really really fucked up stuff. She let me think that was all in my head simply because she didn’t understand how to explain it to me. For the longest time I would make excuses for her, and say well, she didn’t want to burden me, she didn’t want me to have to know, she thought it was a good thing that I couldn’t remember it, (which it is) but for her to go even further, and start putting all these horrible characteristics on me, making me think I’m crazy, that was not ok. 

That was so selfish of her, all she could think about was herself in that situation, how was she gonna be able to handle it, how will she explain it, blah blah blah. I blame her for every time I was raped or assaulted after that and told nobody, because of the way she treated me when I tried to express to her my feelings. I knew all she would do is tell me I was lying, being manipulative, all of that, and because of that, it kept happening. I talked to her as an adult, and she was still trying to hide it from me. I cut her off, told her that I knew, and that I didn’t appreciate how she dealt with it when I was younger. She pulled a victim card and started trying to make me feel guilty.

Instead, I’ll say that my sophomore year of high school I had a kidney stone. When it formed I was on my period so I just thought I had insanely painful cramps and put up with it for a day. That night it got really bad. 

My mother is a registered nurse. I told her the pain felt too intense, something was wrong. She slapped two ibuprofen in my hand and told me to go to sleep. I woke up in the middle of the night in such bad pain I couldn’t even make a sound. 

I ended up army crawling down a flight of stairs and across the floor to her room at 2am. She was still awake. I was terrified. I thought legit, I was dying. I was crying and when I got in there she screamed bloody murder, then put her hand on her hip and very annoyed, asked “do you need to go to the hospital?” And I just muttered, “I think so.”

I was terrified and upset the whole way and my mother was stone silent. Every bump in the road was excruciating and when we finally got there, the already terrified teen I was entered into full panic mode when the nurse took a urine sample and my mother started screaming really loudly. I was like hyperventilating and everything. 

I wished she’d have kept her cool. Maybe that’s petty... idk. Just seems like a registered nurse would be fine and be a bit better about the whole thing. My mother is just a stone cold person to the core.

I specifically remember how one day he brought home this girl that he was interested in and she asked me if she should “go out” with him and I said “no because he masturbates too much” and everybody got mad at me for saying that but like, I didn’t actually know what masturbation was and thought that what he was doing to me was that, because that’s what he told me it was. In hindsight I just get so sad for baby me, because no 7 year old knows what masturbating is or even means. Another incident that comes to mind would be how I was always drawing girls crying but intentionally omitted their mouths and that memory pisses me off too because now my mom is a middle school art teacher who’s always talking about how art depicts the psychology of the creator, like why couldn’t you have been interested in the psychology of art when I needed you the most?

My parents are unable to conceive by themselves, so they adopted my brother (21m), then me (20f) later on (same moms, different dads). 


Around when my bother was 2, he started having seizures. To make a long story short, he now has severe epilepsy, as well as a slew of other disabilities. It came out of nowhere, and it was really hard on my parents. 


I was a newborn at the time, and my aunt came and watched me for a few months while they were reconciling this new life they were going to lead. 


Growing up, my brother has just always needed more care. Diaper changes, feeding, things like that. Totally not their fault, but seeing that for years and years, I internalized a lot of my own needs and suffocated them because I didn't want to burden my parents any more than they already were with my brother.


As a result, I have a *very* hard time asking for help or making my needs known, but at the same time I have almost abandonment problems from all the times my parents had to drop everything and take my brother to the hospital because he had a seizure and hurt himself or something along those lines. 



All this being said, my parents love me very much and I did almost always have my needs attended to. They did their very best with the cards they were given, and im grateful for them.

Basically I could have had 15 extra years without pain and chronic fatigue if I had been listened to and taken seriously. The thing that really grates me is that my parents didn't do any research or anything, they just assumed that they were right. It wasn't even that it was *possible* I had a condition but they decided on balance that I probably didn't; they just assumed as a starting point that they were right and strongly suggested to me that they knew what they were talking about and no doctor or specialist would say different, so it wasn't worth even looking into it.

For some reason, I had to pay for driver’s ed out of my own pocket, even though my older brother and sister didn’t. But I had no income because I lived a 20-minute drive from any workplace. Finally I got a job on the way to my parent’s work, and paid for driver’s ed. By that time I was 18, already 2 years behind when most of my peers were driving. 

After I took driver’s ed, I had a permit, but my parents barely ever took me out to practice driving. They always said they were too tired every time I asked. I needed 90 hours to apply for my test. I only racked up 15 in 2 years, by which time my permit expired, and I had to reapply to take the written test. I paid for the test fee, got my permit, and then forged my hours and went for the road test anyways (which I also paid for out of my own pocket, unlike my siblings). I tried to fake it the best I could, but I’ve always been anxious, and I failed. (The examiner also started out the exam by making a joke about how I’d had my permit for 2 years and never took the test, and they also gave me 2 examiner’s instead of 1 - a tester for the tester.) I bawled my eyes out about how I’d never be independent. 

A month later I moved an hour away from my family. Now I live in a small town I can easily walk around. But quarantine has made it difficult for me to befriend anyone with the legal qualifications and comfort level for me to practice driving with, and my lack of practice (it’s been a year) makes me too nervous to try. I don’t have enough money to hire a private instructor. 

My older sister is 29 and still lives at home. She is heavily codependent on my parents. She just got her license at 28 (for some reason whenever she asked for driving practice, they made time for her...) and even though she’s living rent-free at home and is almost 30, my mom gave her her old car for free. My parents also paid for my brother’s car insurance after he went broke on a drug binge. Meanwhile, I’m the youngest, out of home before any of them, paying all my own bills, and I know that when I finally do get my license because goddammit, I will, I’ll be paying for my own car and my own insurance all by myself.

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","I have two siblings: an Older sister and a younger brother. My sister went away to college and it was just me and my brother. My parents were working really hard and so I barely saw them. I took on the load of watching my brother and cooking, cleaning. Even when it snowed I would go out at night and shovel so my parents could park the car and go to sleep. I was only 13-14 at that time. I never complained about that because it was so small compared to what my parents had to do for work. My brother was abusive. I know people would laugh, “how can someone years younger than you be abusive? Stop being a baby.” But his punches hurt. He was physically and emotionally abusive. Now he is older but very manipulative to the whole family. He once pushed me down the stairs and said I threw myself downy them. I never complained about that either. My father started having more time to spend with my brother and they would always be out. I would be the only one in the house and there were times when I couldn’t make myself food because all the groceries were gone. My brother eats a lot and the excuse is, “he is a boy and needs to eat to grow.” My father and brother would be out of the house for hours and come back with food. But they would only get food for themselves. My mum worked until midnight so I was sleeping by the time she got home. After months of not eating properly my stomach shrank and I couldn’t hold down food. I ended up going to the hospital. I spent 9 hours in the hospital getting tests done. They first thought it was appendicitis but then found nothing wrong. Sometimes I think back to those days and cry because I never told them how I felt. I knew if I told them then it would probably start an argument or they would become more stressed about what they would do. So I kept all of those problems to myself. Now I’m in my first year of college and the pandemic hit. Things are boiling over and I just want to go away to college. I told them I can’t handle being home for college, so I’m hoping I can go this fall. I love my family to death but I need a few months or a year of not contacting them.

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","My current athletic position. My current educational and career endeavors. My parents are/were the most unsupportive humans I could have ever encountered.

I am a (fairly) gifted athletic human (as an adult) and should be and could be further along if I had been put in youth athletics. They decided to forgo youth sports (I wanted to do) to save their time and money. Their home is  paid off and they've both driven opulent vehicles for years (Cadillacs and big trucks) which was bankrolled by my mother's social security (my mother died when I was 13 so the social security office made a payment of $650/month for a triplet set from 13 - 18 ), my father's disability checks and my stepmother's GS12/13 salary. I also paid for my own college.

I am now early 30s pursuing a medical career to have a bigger/better career that is still unsupported as an adult while paying off my undergrad (BA, btw) loans because I wouldn't allow them to have access to my email accounts. I was pushed out on my own as soon as I moved out of the house at 18. At various points during college they billed me for what I owed for my portion of health insurance to which I stopped paying and they tried to force legal action. 

I have VERY mixed emotions about my father and stepmother and truly blame them for a lot of my current circumstances. I can appreciate what it has made me learn to do as an adult from a physical and monetary perspective however without therapy I would not have matured and grown into the human I am to respect certain things.

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","I was molested by more than one of my mom’s boyfriends/husbands. She left them as soon as she found out of course. But other forms of abuse that were present make me blame her for not leaving sooner. She always was on their side and never stuck up for me. Even when she found out, she still visited one shortly after, while I was deeply disturbed and needed her. 

My current step dad is the lesser of two evils, but still has behaviors that are borderline abusive (it is hard for me to tell sometimes because I have had way worse). She still will not stick up for herself or my other siblings. Unfortunately I have picked up a lot of those traits and have been with a few bad ones, as well as having my abuser moments. Every relationship has been a little better and I am too, but still have a lot to work on and little to no support. 

I am 28 and some days place more blame than I should on my mother for how I am and where I am in life. A lot of learned helplessness and pity parties.

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","Just before I turned 17 I lost my virginity by being date raped. That person never did take accountability for it or ever face consequences.

I know I shouldn’t blame my parents (at 34 no less) but I do. They still don’t know. My parents were always hard on me. Nothing I ever did was right and I have carried shame and the thought I am unlovable since a small child. When I was raped I had no safe adult to go to. My parents saw me as an extension of themselves and if I had gone to them they would have covered it up and told me to keep quiet as me being raped would have made other parents judge their parenting (in their minds.) so they would have projected that shame onto me. They would’ve blamed what I was wearing and my friends I was with that night. At the end of the day not a single comment or reaction would have been one of compassion or support on my behalf so I held it in then and hold it in now. If I had parents that weren’t emotionally neglectful I could’ve had courage to get a rape kit done, and maybe stood up to this person who raped me instead of forever hiding it. 

It’s greatly impacted my life and hopefully this year in therapy I can forgive and let this go for my own sake.",2531,knruu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/knruu6/what_is_that_situation_of_your_life_where_you/,1027,1609457110.0,Because they could have easily helped but didn't.,2020-12-31 18:25:10
"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","I got married at 18 to my abusive ex-husband. He was 6""2 to my 5""1. He ""accidentally"" hurt me a lot. He'd never leave marks on me and would make comments about how he learned in the military how he and other guys could joke around and beat each other up without leaving marks.

We got married in August and I came to my dad in October terrified telling him that I was scared my ex would hurt me and that he was aggressive and the relationship was unhealthy. My dad told me that my ex wouldn't hurt me and I was just being dramatic.

In February of the next year my dad decided that he'd help me get out of it (for other reasons, general behavior, lack of work ethic etc.) I was raised in an incredibly religious home and felt a lot of guilt around a marriage not working out and being divorced, especially at 18.

I pushed through a few more months and filed for divorce after I found evidence of my ex cheating.

I was an only child, earned good grades and performed very well in my activities like dance and karate, but you can tell my parents never told me “no”. I recently watched some old home movies and was kinda shocked at how they let me behave - very hyperactive, no filter, constantly needing to be the center of attention in a group of people. My parents were those parents that thought I was “just being a cute kid”. No chores or responsibilities at home either. 

I think overall I turned out pretty independent and well-off as an adult because of their encouragement to perform well in school and my activities, but sometimes I still struggle when I face a problem and can’t get something I want.",2531,knruu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/knruu6/what_is_that_situation_of_your_life_where_you/,1027,1609457110.0,Because they could have easily helped but didn't.,2020-12-31 18:25:10
"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","Long one, but it's how I feel about my parents. I love them, but they failed me in so many ways. Sorry for any errors, I'm on mobile.

I had my son very young, 17. I was in an abusive relationship; mentally, sexually, physically, all of it. This was my first serious relationship and it started around 15 years old. My parents saw me dealing with this abuse for long before my son and they didn't really say much about it, just kinda passive about it.

 They were never really parents in the sense of talking to me about life and good life/relationship skills. I would leave for a week or more at a time and they never tried to contact me or seemed worried. They just kinda assumed I was an adult and I was fine. Let me tell you, ages 14-18, they very much still need their parents in their lives. Obviously in a different way than when the child is younger, but still need guidance. My parents never created a relationship between us, so we couldn't really talk about personal things. My parents were always distant, unsupportive and mentally unstable. Often blaming me for things that weren't my fault. They weren't abusive, but emotionally unstable and not willing to grow. So we grew apart since I was young. 

When I was 16, my ex convinced me to move 2 hrs away with him. My parents, knowing I was being manipulatied and abused allowed me to leave aways and to dropped me out of high school to live with this guy that had been arrested a few times for abusing me and then manipulating me back into his arms. They never even had a chat with me about life and goals, etc. Just acted like it was a child moving out and that's that.

Anyways, I had my son at 17, and the abuse was still very bad. Holes all over the walls, clear signs things were not okay. They visited and said nothing.

 I tired to leave his dad multiple times and finish high school at 18. Eventually I succeeded. I wanted a different life for my son. I was still cognitivley learning to function as an adult, while being a mom and going to high school, but somwhow I made it through.

As soon as I finished high school, my parents left to move across the country to help my brother who was in an abusive relationship. I was hurt how they would talk about helping him, saving him and how horrible his partner was. I mean, his partner was awful, but why didn't they help me in that way? My brother's partner was mentally and emotionally abusive. Not saying that any abuse is better then the other, but they didn't seem to care when the signs of me being physically abused where vivid or even done in front of them (they called the cops once and then never talked to me about it again).

Anyways, my parent moved across the country to help my brother. Leaving me alone in a city they moved me too when I was in my early teens with no family or support system.

Now, it isn't their fault I had a son and it's 100% my responsibility, I did what I did and that's on me. But they knew I was mothering alone, no help in any form from the father, even though the father said he would be there at the start of the pregnancy, saying he would help and be there; which is why I went through with the pregnancy. Obviously, I was young, naive and manipulated by this abusive person with no support system to help me figure out what to do. So I believed him.

I've worked my butt off since and now have a university diploma, working on my degree and wanting to do a masters. All of this while working and raising my son alone which is hard. Now, slowly with therapy I'm slowly healing from my young life and recovering from all the trauma I've lived through. I have trouble trusting anyone, sex isn't really something I can do because of the abuse. I'm too independent and can rely on anyone because I can't trust. Frendships and intimate relationships were I can trust and not be on guard are still new to me. 

I'm mad because had they been better parents from the start maybe I wouldn't be a young mom. Maybe I wouldn't be so mentally ill from all the abuse and things I went through. My life could have been maybe a little better during those years. I'll never know.

Recently, my parents moved back to the city I live in. Having been across the country for the majority of my son's young life, they realized they missed him and wanted to be by him, especially since he is probably going to be their only grandson. My son loves them and they are good to him. But I fake a smile and relationship to keep the peace. I never told them how I felt about my young teens and adults life because I know they wouldn't understand and would fight me. 

But I'll keep going so my son has a great life. I don't regret having him. Without my son, I would probably be dead and never had left that relationship. My son and I have an amazing bond. We talk about everything. We apologize to each other and work on social skills together so he can grow up knowing boundaries and what healthy relationships look like. Even if it's no perfect, I'm not going to be a passive parent. I love him too much and I'll be strong for him forever.",2531,knruu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/knruu6/what_is_that_situation_of_your_life_where_you/,1027,1609457110.0,Because they could have easily helped but didn't.,2020-12-31 18:25:10

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","Growing up my parents weren’t super well off financially. They got divorced and my mom had to switch jobs around the same time when I was about 13. According to my mom, her new job didn’t have great benefits and it was too expensive to put me or my brother on her insurance plans. Because of this the last time I saw a dentist was when I was 13 getting my braces off. I’m 22 now so granted, I could’ve gone myself, but I was struggling to pay bills with two roommates and I knew if I went it would be a hefty bill because of how long it’d been since I’d gone.

Fast forward to now and I’m trying not to cry from the pain I’m in. Since I never went to a dentist as a teenager, I never got my wisdom teeth removed. Now one is growing sideways and shoving my molar into the tooth in front of it. The decay has gotten down to the nerve so it’s just a constant throbbing. Luckily, my grandparents were able to co-sign a medical credit card of sorts so I can get the teeth removed, but I’m still having to take this semester off from school considering I also pay for my tuition out of pocket.

I think the absolute icing on the cake is that my mom is decently well off now. She’s not rich by any means but she remarried and they both make decent money.

My mom started working soon after we arrived, she worked just as much as my dad to the point were they had to take my aunt in to take care of us. I hardly saw my parents from the age of 5 onwards. 

My mom got pregnant when I was 7 and I lost more of little attention I got from them. Not only that, but my aunt had a horrible falling out with my parents and had to leave, so the responsibly of taking care of/raising my twin sisblings fell to me

I love my parents and will always admire their work ethic, my mom went to school and became a nurse and my dad started his own construction company. They game me and my siblings a life we could never had in our home country, I  am forever grateful for everything they've done. But I've never been close to them, they know nothing of who I am, what I believe in or what my struggles have been.

I wish they did.",2531,knruu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/knruu6/what_is_that_situation_of_your_life_where_you/,1027,1609457110.0,Because they could have easily helped but didn't.,2020-12-31 18:25:10

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","I stopped being a child and became an adult. That included moving out with a lot of drama. We didn't speak for several months. When we started speaking again it was tense but I still kept myself financially separate from them.

I went from having them graciously pay for everything to handling it all on my own. I'd do it again. Financially it was tight but feasible. 

Then I got in a fight with some housemates, I was horribly sick to the point of needing surgery, and realized I didnt have any friends. My boyfriend and I were LDR at the time. I started living out of my car. 

My parents didnt believe me when I called them mid panic attack for help. I continued to live out of my car for a week until a coworker noticed and mentioned it to my mom, who I also worked with (different departments and I was PT). Only because she was *embarrassed* did she tell me I could come home and they came out to move my things. Only then did they see how hostile and unsafe my living arrangement was. Only then did they see how much weight I lost because I couldn't fucking eat. 

They have always thought I was a drama queen and I believed them. I was so used to downplaying everything that it wasnt until a doctor and a therapist sat me down to say I could *die* due to another mental health spiral that i realized that yes, maybe it was traumatic, and maybe, they could have stepped up. And maybe, I can take myself and my health a bit more seriously and less candid than my parents did. 

They love me. They always will. But I will never forget hanging up the phone as my mother *laughed* at me for crying and sitting there in stunned silence realizing how alone I was. I got through it, sure, and they did help me, but I will *never* need their help again.",2531,knruu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/knruu6/what_is_that_situation_of_your_life_where_you/,1027,1609457110.0,Because they could have easily helped but didn't.,2020-12-31 18:25:10
"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","My mom met my dad as a one-night-stand. She accidentally got knocked up with me, and blamed me for so long for 'keeping her stuck with my dad'.

*""Oh, if you had never existed, I'd have never been stuck with your dad for so long.""*

The thing is, I have 3 younger siblings; she could have just never went back to my dad, but she did, and had 3 more kids with him. But she made me feel like I was the one who started the downfall of her life. She'd tell me all the time under her breath when she was mad, that she wished she had just aborted me.

Hearing this constant stuff as I was growing up heavily influenced my mental health. When I was 12 years old, I tried to end my life for the first time. There are dozens of more times after that, too. She either didn't know, or didn't care. I've had to cover my own self-inflicted wounds at 3 am in our bathroom and viciously clean every surface so she never knew what I had tried to do; then wake up, go to school, and pretend nothing happened.

I'm 21 now, and I still struggle to see that I matter, that I have good people around me who genuinely care about me, and I'm not a burden at all. My mom thinks we are just 'good', but I secretly carry this around with me every single day. 

It flares up a lot sometimes; I need validation from people around me that I'm not ruining their day by being around them. I wish I wasn't like this.",2531,knruu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/knruu6/what_is_that_situation_of_your_life_where_you/,1027,1609457110.0,Because they could have easily helped but didn't.,2020-12-31 18:25:10
"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","Being groomed then molested as a child from 5-8 by a family member.  

My heart is so split -- I've never told them but they missed all the signs.  

Pulling the plug on my gran at 22 and my mom going into a rage blackout after the realization hit she wouldn't survive.  Angrily blaming me for killing her.  I was a co medical proxy because she was too biased and would've kept her on life support.  I watched her die for 12 days while my mom said it was too hard to go and see her.  I get my mom was angry-- but I don't feel I was mature enough to make that decision on my own.  The rest of the family who were fighting agreed with me and it pissed my mom off.  I can still hear her voice saying ""you just gave up on her and threw her away"".  I feel I pay that price all the time for my decision.  My gran was like my mom and I felt the only person at that point in my life who loved me unconditionally.   My mom always acted like a friend or sister and if she had stepped up and done her job as her daughter I wouldn't have had to.

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","I’m one of four kids. We weren’t wealthy by any means. But my parents tried hard to give us the things we needed and sometimes (Christmas usually) the things we really wanted as well. I’m very thankful for that. 

But they did NOT prepare me for life. I didn’t know what a credit score was or how a credit card even worked until I was in debt. I signed up for student loans for college like it was nothing at all, now I owe $80k. I worked hard to be a straight-A student for all of my academic career only to find that I have zero business skills and it took me almost 3 years of constant applying and interviewing to get a job in my field (librarian). My parents call and ask why I’m not buying a house or marrying my boyfriend. Um, we are poor? 

Also, my parents are (for some reason) extremely against mental health care. I vividly remember my mom *threatening* to send me to a psychologist after an angst-filled teenaged argument. It was a threat  meant for me to just shut up, not that it would be because I actually needed therapy. Which I did! I was incredibly depressed as a teen, overweight, and lonely and developed a severe eating disorder when I went to college. My parents’ response? Dad asked “how much more weight are you planning on losing” and Mom said I “look like a Holocaust victim.” That’s all. And I harbor that fear of psychological help still to this day. 

Also, I’m bi, but I’ve never ever said that out loud to anyone because I truly cannot imagine what my parents would say. We went to catholic school (though they are Lutheran) and my grandpa was a pastor. I remember my mom saying those lines, how it’s not a sin unless you act on it or people can do what they want but they don’t want to have to see it, etc. I actually have a sneaking suspicion my brother is gay but I don’t think any of us will ever come out of our closets. It’s just not possible. 

They never talk about ANYTHING. When my grandma died, my mom called me and talked for twenty minutes about the weather and how my schooling was going before casually mentioning that her mother had passed away and the funeral was that weekend.

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","When I was in high school I was in an abusive relationship. I didn’t know the term at the time, but my then boyfriend was a skilled gas lighter and was very emotionally manipulative. It took me years to realize the extent of the manipulation and sexual abuse.

He would show up to my house unannounced, sometimes claiming that we’d had plans even though I was sure we didn’t. He’d refuse to leave, and sometimes give me a story about his parents kicking him out and having no place to go. 
My mom was planning to go out of state for a week, and I was going to be alone at home. She knew I was keeping this information from my boyfriend because I didn’t want him showing up knowing I was by myself. Anyway, she and I ended up getting in to an argument, and the next time my boyfriend was over she told him she’d be leaving and to “watch me”. 
She made eye contact with me as she said it, making it clear that she understood what she was doing. 
I hid a lot of what was going on, as I was really in denial about being abused and couldn’t admit it to myself, let alone others. When other people noticed I denied/downplayed it. But looking back as an adult, I can’t believe I was really tricking the adults in my life. That was one of the most hurtful things she ever did to me. She died a few years ago, and that betrayal is one I still grapple with. I just have a hard time believing she didn’t know .  I wish she or someone else would’ve tried a little harder to figure out what was going on. It would’ve saved me years of pain.

My mom instead acted victimized as if I were an evil child who was being mean to her for not eating her cooking. And the reason I would have any sort of empathy for them is because I know that the disability was (and still is) somewhat stigmatized then. And I know if I had been diagnosed, the schools might not have let me have the same honors experiences other students did because they assumed people with my condition are ""dumb"" no matter what (and I didn't get into honors until 8th grade), and college is important to my parents as neither of them went. Even though I can't see not getting someone checked over these feelings, I can understand intellectually why they wouldn't.

But at the same time, it doesn't justify things. I went all my life thinking I was evil and had the worst intentions because my parents wouldn't see the good in me. When other people were mean to me or did the same for no good reason, I attributed it to something I was doing wrong personally instead of something I didn't have much control over (and how could I have control if I didn't know what to control sometimes?). I sometimes wouldn't even question disproportionate meanness as disproportionate and didn't realize the extent to which I deserved better. Stigmatizing my disability is horrible, and also: There are many conditions where people have trouble eating for any given reason, so this could have been a more serious health problem and they didn't check even though they had time and money to do so. This could have been bad and I might have had serious long term health affects (and probably do) all because of their pride. 

I blamed myself for not articulating myself better at a young age, but then a therapist told me ""I don't think that was on you to do at 5 or 9 or even 15"" and it hit me that I had been taught to feel responsible for many things I shouldn't have been responsible for.",2531,knruu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/knruu6/what_is_that_situation_of_your_life_where_you/,1027,1609457110.0,Because they could have easily helped but didn't.,2020-12-31 18:25:10
"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","My mom's late life scoliosis. She got it at age 62. I moved home from college because I couldn't find a job, despite an engineering degree. I also didn't have a car. I was 23 and had never had a car, although I had my license since 16. My mom gets alimony and hadn't worked a job in literally 20 years.

In July I got a job making $16/hr with a 40 minute commute there and 40 minutes back. My mom let me use her car. All was well. I chipped in for maintenance expenses and obviously paid for the gas I used. 

In September my mom decided to get a job as a cashier. We shared the car, and often would pick-up or drop off the other. All was well.

In October she decided to start biking to work. This was only 3 miles there and 3 miles back, and she figured it was good for her health. So she biked.

In December I bought a car for $3,400 cash. She stopped biking.

In those 3 months, she got scoliosis. To this day she blames me because I used her car. The way I see it, she hadn't worked in 20 years, and decided to get a job suddenly. She had enough money to buy me a car if she really had to. I couldn't afford a car at the time. She has exercised very little her entire life, and I'm sure she had bad posture on the bike. We also could've carpooled, as we had done without problems previously.

Her back looks really bad, and seeing it makes me want to cry. I didnt understand how car payments worked at the time. Looking back if I'd known this would be the outcome, I would've made getting a car a priority over my schooling experiences.",2531,knruu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/knruu6/what_is_that_situation_of_your_life_where_you/,1027,1609457110.0,Because they could have easily helped but didn't.,2020-12-31 18:25:10
"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","I love my parents and I appreciate everything they've done for me wholeheartedly. And so I would never tell them this. But both of my parents are reactive, and have childhood trauma, and are afraid of being alone. I do believe that they love each other, but their relationship has always been fraught with tension, and I've had to play somewhat of a ""therapist"" role at times.

My ex cheated on me but we ended up getting back together (for a time). And our relationship was also very fraught with tension with a lot of reactivity, and I think I stayed for so long because I learned from my parents that it is worse to be alone than to be with someone that doesn't treat you well.

Again, I do think that they love each other, and they do have good times, vacations, and moments. So I'm not saying that they treat each other poorly or horribly or abusively, just that I think I learned from them that relationships can/should have a greater deal of agitation and frustration than they need.

"What is that situation of your life where you don't blame your parents for it, but secretly in heart you do?","TW: sexual assault, self harm (hopefully this is how we do warnings here, im sorta new to reddit sorry)

In middle school one summer i was sexually assaulted (i struggle saying I was r***d). I wasn't in a position to realize that what happened was bad or damaging. I just went on with my life like everything was normal, even talking to the guy still. It was on a cruise, so once that was over and I knew deep down that I was safe, I slowly started to realize how scared I was

After a slip to a camp counselor that I thought I may have been pregnant (which obviously rang some alarms) I was pulled to the side after a dance to talk about what I said. I remember not being able to leave until I talked about this trauma that I hadn't even recognized as traumatic yet, and I remember leaving in tears. I was so angry and sad and I felt like I couldn't breathe.

A rule at this camp is to not leave your rooms at night unless youre going to the bathroom, and I broke that rule to go see the guy I really really liked at this camp for comfort. And my parents were furious, especially because I had to call home to tell them not only that I had broken a huge rule and needed to be picked up but for some reason I was made to tell them about what happened to me on the cruise on the phone in the best way my scared preteen brain could make sense of it.

That following school year I struggled with the worst depression I had ever felt, I started drinking, I started self harming, I took pills, just everything I could to lessen this immense pain I couldn't make sense of. I blacked out at least once and I was just in a real bad place. Because to this day I couldn't tell them what really happened, they had already made up their mind. To this day, my dad still calls that period of my life ""wilding out"" rather than the utter cry for help it actually was.

I'm happy to say that I've been in therapy for a long while, I've been sober since, and I haven't been hurt like that since then, but the fact that my parents mention The Cruise Incident with such nonchalance and clearly with the intent to make me feel bad is just.

I did 3 years completely single to enjoy my freedom, travel, party and focus on myself (no regrets. My best 2 years of my life were in this window.) Then I did 3 years of casual dating with my guard completely up. It was super difficult and unfulfilling so I finally let my guard down a little and allowed someone to call himself my boyfriend. Even though I allowed it, I felt  avoidance tendencies and pessimistic about committing. It wasn't until recently I realized I'm finally ready for commitment and a fulfilling loving relationship.

After those two years I got in contact with said current boyfriend again and still tried to keep my guards up at least for a while and very much failed at that.

Fast forward to last year, I had this urge to just try dating apps and all that and then November came and a friend introduced me to someone. This guy, we hit it off and it just felt like I can welcome another person into my life. It felt comfortable and peaceful, with no efforts. Sadly, I noticed some red flags after 3 days of talking to him (he lies a lot and cuts off convos abruptly when he doesn't like the topic and expects you to go along with it 🙃 NOPE!).

How long/when did you realize you were emotionally ready to open your heart up again after an intense heartbreak?,"When I felt safe within my body to trust another man with my entire being again.When I made sure to actively work through the pain with my trusted therapist.  


 I was very intentional about taking proper time to nurture myself and actually grieve after my last relationship ended so by the time I felt ready to date again, it was a whole body yes and felt proud of myself for honoring myself and my last relationship with my perception of integrity with the space I allowed for myself following it. I really got to know myself during the grieving process. Where did I abandon myself within my last relationship? There was so much emotional,etc betrayal toward the end of my last relationship on both ends- where did I betray myself within that relationship? Getting down to the nitty gritty. Allowing the process of grief to actually be worked through and not avoiding any of it. (yes, there are aspects I am still grieving or moving through,etc. yes, I am honest and open about that with my partner) Yes, I was still scared that heartbreak would ensue moving forward but I trusted my intuition with every step this time. It allowed for such a beautiful relationship to eventually flourish between me and my current partner. Though we took our relationship slow in comparison to most (or anybody I know really) and were super intentional about the process of relationship with each other. I allowed myself and gave myself permission to Not rush anything and to really pay attention to what came up for me and why these things were coming up for me and really work through things, without laying that responsibility on my partner (though he has been openhearted every step of the way with my moving thru that, as have I with him). I learned that often times when theres like this 'whirlwind' honeymoon phase very quickly at the beginning, it can mean that there is something either party are trying to avoid and/or escape from. I paid attn to if ever he or I felt like rushing things.   


All I can really add is pay attention, pay attention PAY ATTENTION to how you feel in your body and ask yourself if you're truly honoring yourself, your love for yourself and whatever the love existed within your past relationship? Is it resolved or not? Try not to bring as much of that baggage as possible into your next relationship by deep-diving into inquiry/therapy/reading certain books etc.

Young at heart is someone who has not been jaded by life. They are able to assess risk and consequences, recognize mistakes and take responsibility.

"What, to you, is the difference between someone who is immature, and someone who is ''young at heart''?","There was a girl at work, about early to mid 20s, and I considered her immature. It was a bunch of factors. She was there a year before I was hired and was devastated when she found out I made the same salary as her. She wanted a raise to pay off her car loan and the boss said she didn't deserve a raise yet. She also met with the cheif HR person. She was so... inexperienced with office life. 

She had bright pink hair and never dressed professionally. She lived rent free with her parents and she and her boyfriend were big into playing video games and going to conventions where you dress up in costumes. Every single month her period would catch her by surprise and she's have to go home to change. She didn't know how to talk to coworkers or clients. 

Then there's my uncle. He's the fun uncle. Never married, no kids. He goes to work and then has his passion projects on the side. He plays in a band and goes to concerts, makes jokes and is a joy to be around. That's young at heart to me. He's got wit and charm and charisma and is unlike any other 60 year old I know.

"You are in a relationship, your heart is telling you to stay but your brain is telling you to leave. Which one do you listen to and why?","It really depends. I would probably reach out to get other opinions first.

Reason being: I have learnt that my gut can be trusted, or rather is to be trusted. But I've also leant, that I should try and look for the main problem first  aka , never shutting off the brain.

A classic situation would be me being gaslighted yet again. That has nothing to do with how much you love them. My gut would tell me to leave before my brain did .  

Which doesn't make sense, because me not having any feelings, let alone regards to the wishes of others ( aka my partners not getting what they wanted at that time) , was a main complaint.

What helps you against panick attacks?,"☆ Driving to the hopsital and sitting in the emergency parking area. (If it's really bad) 

☆Taking an anxiety tablet 

☆There's a particular spoken breathing guide on YT I listen to which really helps calm things down, I follow 5 minutes of the breathing and it helps regulate things. 


I have definitely been that person in emergency and calling ambulances because I 100% thought I was going to die, my heart rate has been crazy at times. I have different levels of severity with panic attacks but a few have just floored me.

 Then of course you live in fear of having another and don't feel safe. Haven't had one in a while TOUCH WOOD.

"For those who have lost someone recently, how are you doing?","I lost my dad November 30th. He was only 58 and I feel like I’m right back at the beginning of the pandemic when I was confused and angry every day.  I have trouble with my short term memory now and I no longer have the energy for small talk or the question “are you ok?”

I think I can only compare grief to that feeling you have when you don’t know what to do with your hands when you’re nervous, except now it’s I don’t know what to do with my entire body some days. I walk into rooms and sort of just stand around people, but don’t participate in the conversation. I start sentences that have no endings, and I’ve had hyper ventilating crying moments in front of people I don’t know very well.

I’m grateful that I started therapy 3 months before it happened (I’m actually very VERY grateful for that) but it doesn’t make it less sad.",291,kthnp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/kthnp9/for_those_who_have_lost_someone_recently_how_are/,227,1610187224.0,EDIT: 💜💜 Wow it hurts my heart so much to see so many people grieving for lost loved ones.

"For those who have lost someone recently, how are you doing?","I lost my dad 7 months ago suddenly. He was 58. It was extremely hard the first few weeks, and of course celebrating our first Christmas/my birthday without my dad was tough. I’m at the point in my grieving where I’m fine throughout the day and then it just hits like a truck out of no where. I’ll begin to remember him and how much my life has changed. Some things just trigger memories and I’ll randomly play out his last day (I had to call 911 when he was unconscious, he had a second stroke).

One of the biggest thing about grief that was hard to deal with is that if no one else around you has gone through loss like you, they will forget you’re grieving. They will give you support for the first two weeks or maybe the first month but then they go back to their normal lives.

"For those who have lost someone recently, how are you doing?","I lost my mom to cancer in October. Like others, I’m doing ok but just ok. Things like this thread will get me to cry, as do other semi random events. I was lucky enough to get back to her before she died, and had a week with her, holding her hand with my brother when she passed. That was important 

I’m really grateful she went quickly (was golfing three weeks prior to her passing) as she would have hated being incapacitated, but it’s still a bizarre world without her in it. I thought she’d live forever. I have a great family and support system of friends, so that helps, but I worry about always being the guy who talks about it too much. Everyone has this experience in one way or another

The loss itself, I'm doing fine. It's been a bit hard over christmas and my birthday, but otherwise, I'm fine.

 Since there's COVID, the various entities that I owe money, or have to send back paperwork aren't harrassing me, so there's that.

Due to the restrictions and covid worries, I couldn't visit them often enough, and when I did, they were already no longer aware of a lot, due to cancer progress and heavy medications. 

Only seen my family twice this year, on both funerals. No hugs, ofc. Also, my job is extremely attached to the pandemic, so I worked overtime often. If it weren't for my amazing SO, I would have gone mad depressed.

"For those who have lost someone recently, how are you doing?","I lost my Grandad really suddenly bang in the middle of the first UK lockdown.

He was in pain for a very long time with heart failure but never told anybody, no one got to say goodbye. I’m struggling to accept that it’s even happened, he was the most wonderful man.

But the stories and hundreds of people we don’t even know have reached out to tell the family how he helped them, or a story about him and it’s made things more bearable. I like the quote “to live in the hearts of those we leave behind, isn’t to die.”

Lost my brother due to an overdose back in July. No one in our family knew he was using, it was half heartedly assumed, but never ever did we assume to the extent of going to rehab (unaware to us) and eventually relapsing to his death. 

It’s heavy on everyone as we all feel direct fault for not reaching out to each other more. Can’t imagine the pain it has on my mother and father but we’re fighting through it and unfortunately this was the wake up call that told us to all be a little closer (at least on a communication level).

"For those who have lost someone recently, how are you doing?","I lost my husband. The one year anniversary of his death just passed, but it seems impossible that that much time has passed since I was last with him.

I gave up our apartment and moved home with my mom in a different city and I haven't been able to return to my job due to anxiety and PTSD. 

In a way, it feels like I've lost almost everything. My husband and best friend, my home, my job, and my future... since even after a year, I can't imagine my future without him. 

At this moment, I'm doing okay. I am in a much better place than I have been in the past. I've been getting out of bed every day, showering, getting dressed, going on walks, eating healthy meals. Sometimes all I can manage are the basics, sometimes even those are a struggle. People say that grief comes in waves, and I've definitely found that to be true. 

Grieving during a pandemic has been hard, since you aren't able to spend the time with your loved ones, or like, going to the gym was really good for me, but now they're closed. It is so easy to just want to stay in bed all day in your pajamas and not see or talk to anyone... and like, that's all you want to do, but you also know its not healthy for you.

It’s even worse because so many people just don’t see it as a significant loss.

"For those who have lost someone recently, how are you doing?","Horrible. I (F26) lost my ex boyfriend (M24)
 last year in April. April 21st.
I cry myself to sleep every night because we were going to ammend our relationship that fell apart 3 years ago. My mother always told me ""if its true love, it'll come back to you."" He sure did come back. He tried.
Jan 2nd was his birthday. That would of made him 25 today. Im depressed. Im not sure what stage im grieving im in anymore. Im all over the place. The last conversation we had was to hang out and patch things up and catch up. We were too scared to meet because of Covid. It wasn't even that bad then..I wish I had a time machine. I've managed to find a job that pays good and I have an interview coming up next week. I have butterflies in my stomach of course. I haven't had any sort of normalcy in such a long time. I think I'll be okay. I'll be fine.

"For those who have lost someone recently, how are you doing?","I lost my mom almost three months ago. It was excruciating the first few days, weeks, and months. But I’ve learned to process it. But no doubt, I have moments where I cannot believe she’s no longer physically here. She was my best friend and my world. We spent everyday together pretty much for the past 3 or so years and she passed pretty unexpectedly. Losing a parent as a youngish adult (I’m 30) fucking sucks, no doubt about it. Luckily, though, I was able to be there when she passed. Me and bro were there when the docs shut off the life support machines. Unimaginable pain but also, I’m glad I was with her in those final moments. 

My spirituality has most definitely helped me through, as I know she’s still here in spirit, guiding me now more than ever. I get confirmation of this quite often. I even dreamt of her a month or so ago and it was beautiful. I’m also now in grief therapy which I think is helping some. I miss her SO SO much, but it gives me solace that she’s no longer suffering from her long-term chronic illness.

What about yourself do you take most pride in?,"I think I'm courageous, often I might actually feel timid and frightened but I push myself to go past that ... even if I'm quaking inside I try to push myself to face the fear. I actually took this DNA test that has all this personality related stuff, according to that I have way more of a chance of essentially being a super timid and fretful person. I think a huge part of it is that my parents were very brave, they aren't biologically my parents btw as I was adopted, so they modeled for me that one shouldn't be afraid of the world but instead reach out and try as much as possible. It was so good for me to grow up in an environment where people tried to show the world as a place to be enamored and interested in, to be open and curious. Dad loved art and was a painter and loved music from all over, mom loved people and was very warm. Both very open and curious about others, very bright and hopeful. 

As a child my mom was always trying to get me to engage with the world, from having me place my hands onto the bark of trees and feel pleasure and awe in nature to going out and meeting new people to really engaging me in the scientific method of observing the world with openness ... they really were so formative in getting me to view life with a kind of wonderment.

it touches so many sensitive issues and i think we could all relate to the main character and it's wonderful how she was so far from being perfect. one of the most real protagonist i've seen in tv. and while sometimes being heavy, it's just incredibly fun to watch, has so many heartwarming moments and i just love it.

Which TV Series has captured your heart?,"Psych. It's so perfect, extremely funny, and incredibly underrated. I feel like those responsible for the show absolutely made it their passion.

It's about a fake psychic detective and his conservative best friend who solve crimes for the Santa Barbara Police Department. Shawn, the fake psychic, sees life as an adventure and is very outgoing and a bit ridiculous. He is hyperobservant and charming. Gus, his best friend since infancy, is Shawn's foil - very cautious but also knows lots of scientific, medical, and historical facts, which help a ton in cases. At the police department, there's junior detective Juliet O'Hara and her partner, head detective Carlton ""Lassie"" Lassiter. Juliet is empathetic and thoughtful, but also an amazing detective. Her partner, Lassiter, is extremely skeptical of Shawn's claims that he's psychic. He's a gun-loving, trigger-happy, guilty-until-proven-innocent detective. Then there's the Chief of Police, Karen Vick, who is stern but respects her staff and often hires Shawn for cases (...although sometimes Shawn gets involved in cases he wasn't exactly invited to work on!). And whenever Shawn gets stumped, his retired detective father, Henry, is always there to help, one way or another. He's extremely strict and tough on Shawn, but he does love him and is actually the one who taught Shawn the abilities he utilizes to navigate and solve his cases.",204,gbt4ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/gbt4ly/which_tv_series_has_captured_your_heart/,476,1588405220.0,,2020-05-02 03:40:20

"Women who have survived a heart attack, what was it like?","It was scary.  I actually had a series of four to five in 24 hours.  I  had never had any previous cardiac issues.  I was only 43 at the time, and I quite suddenly became nauseous and sweaty while showering.  I tried to finish up my shower and couldn’t.  I collapsed into my bed soaking wet and starting experiencing pain under my left breast, wrapping around my side to the back, my left shoulder up the left side of my neck.  I was shaking and my heart rate was high (I was able to have my son grab a pulse oximeter).  My poor teenage boys had to call an ambulance, and they were literally going to send me home from the ER because all the tests were coming back fine.  The only thing that caught it was my troponin levels increased-that’s how they knew heart damage had occurred.  It was labeled NSTEMI.  We never did find the cause-it wasn’t due to a blockage, so the doctors attributed it to an arrhythmia.  They haven’t found the arrhythmia problem to this day, I’m not on any blood thinners, and the cardiac doctors have given me a clean bill of health.  I still get concerned whenever I start getting hot/sweaty/nauseous at all, since I would have never expected those to be associated with having a heart attack, especially in my forties.  I hope this answers your question.",745,gcp1b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/gcp1b8/women_who_have_survived_a_heart_attack_what_was/,101,1588533998.0,,2020-05-03 15:26:38
"Women who have survived a heart attack, what was it like?","OMD totally scary 

I was on campus when it happened.  Buying breakfast before class, when suddenly I had a hard time breathing.  It was like the air was too warm to breathe.  I collected my breakfast, put it in my bag and quickly took my stuff to the first aid room.  I then collapsed on the floor, took my jacket, scarf, hoodie and hat off, and security called for first aid.  They called the ambulance who thought it was either asthma, acid reflux, anxiety, or an allergic reaction.  We decided to go to the hospital.  They took an EKG and said something isn't right.  Immediately to the trauma bay and this point onwards is a bit of a blur in my memory.  But they transferred me to another hospital.  They took me to the Cath Lab and put a stent in my artery via my wrist.  It was incredibly painful.  There was also something heavy on my chest. The pain from the heart attack combined with whatever heavy item was on my chest, made me feel really nauseous and unwell.  After surgery, I was in the hospital for 6 days.  I couldn't move my wrist for 24 hours, and an IV line was put in my other arm, so I couldn't move that either.  My parents had to help me with meals because of both arms being immovable.  I also hadn't eaten since the night before because my breakfast was still in my bag.  I was the youngest on the ward.  This was 2 months ago.  And I am still learning how to deal with it day by day.  I have 5 new meds to take.  I gotta check my weight everyday, and my blood pressure, and heart rate have to be monitored.  I got a Fitbit to monitor my heart rate since the clinics are closed.  I have since been diagnosed with a condition called SCAD which is the cause of my heart attack.",745,gcp1b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/gcp1b8/women_who_have_survived_a_heart_attack_what_was/,101,1588533998.0,,2020-05-03 15:26:38
"Women who have survived a heart attack, what was it like?","I had my first one at 18 years old. My entire left side went numb, I became extremely dizzy, disoriented, cold sweats and nauseated. I went to the hospital and was told my troponin levels were elevated and I likely experienced a ""heart related event."" I was never told it was a 'heart attack' but it was more likely a 'transient ischemic attack.' In any case, both of those events are centered around the inability to get oxygen normally to a part of the body (brain/heart/lungs) due to a clot or other vascular issue. I was given no meds, not asked to stay for observation, nothing.

The wildest thing to me is that at that time, it was well-known that I was having issues with my energy/tiredness due to my heart condition. I had surgery as a baby and needed surgery less than a year after this even to close an atrial septal defect in the middle of the atria of my heart that had gotten to be 15 mm wide.

I do not think women are taken as seriously as men when it comes to heart attacks. Men have symptoms that are more ""textbook"" while women definitely do not. But when your heart is fucking up, boy can you tell. Whether you're a man or a woman. I have since learned to advocated for my own health - its easy to do when you have a chronic heart condition from birth.",745,gcp1b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/gcp1b8/women_who_have_survived_a_heart_attack_what_was/,101,1588533998.0,,2020-05-03 15:26:38

"Women who have survived a heart attack, what was it like?","I was 32, a Kindergarten teacher. It was 1995. I’d been taking a triptan drug for migraine headaches for a couple of years. This one particular occasion, a few hours after I took the tablet, I began to feel terrible pressure in my chest and up into the left side of my jaw. I honestly thought it was indigestion at first and chewed some antacid tablets. The pressure and feeling of panic grew. I called my parents. They got me and drove me to the local ER. 

It was set up with a “triage” nurse at a desk where you came in. The nurse wrote down your symptoms and sent your name to the back. You were told to go to the waiting area and wait until a nurse came out and called your name. 

So, I went to the desk and said I was having chest pains and was starting to feel nauseated. The nurse looked at me and said, “Well, you’re not having a heart attack. Go sit over there and wait for someone to call you.” We sat down. I remember that I started sweating and I was moaning as the pain in my chest intensified. It was very crowded, children crying, noise, smells...we’d been waiting over an hour when I found myself suddenly on my hands and knees puking on some random guy’s foot. 

Just at that moment one of the ER nurses came out from the treatment area to call the next patient and saw me. Turns out she was the mother of one of my students. She rushed me to the back, heard the words “chest pain” and had the doctor, an IV, nitro, EKG all inside 15 minutes. 

I was in the ICU for 2 days, had a cardiac cath, and stress test. It was determined that I had no blockage or other cardiac disease. However, the triptan migraine drug had caused me to have spasms in my coronary artery. They were severe enough to cause a myocardial infarction that left me with moderate heart damage.",745,gcp1b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/gcp1b8/women_who_have_survived_a_heart_attack_what_was/,101,1588533998.0,,2020-05-03 15:26:38
"Women who have survived a heart attack, what was it like?","Not me, but my mother. A few weeks ago, my mother decided to go out and hang out with her friend. That night, I was surprised that I didn't get a goodnight text or any of the sort as she would always either call me or text me. I thought nothing of it as she probably fell asleep. The next morning, I noticed how my mother wasn't home. Once again, I thought nothing of it and that she probably wanted to spend more time with her friend. 

The next day, I was starting to get worried until she called me. She said that she was in the hospital, and that she ended up getting a heart attack. I gave my step father the phone as she wanted to talk to him, and he didn't even believe her. He truly didn't believe that my mother was in the hospital and just passed it off as ""trying to start an argument."" It took nearly an hour for him to realize that my mother was serious as he could hear one of the machines through the phone. I had to stay away from my step father that weekend as I would have cursed him out for that. 

Two days later, we picked my mother up from the hospital, and we learned that she was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. During the time at home, she always said how her shoulder hurts, and I had to massage it time to time. She also had many dark bruises on her arms. A few weeks later she is doing fine. Her shoulder still hurts but it's getting better. I'm just happy that she's here with me.

"Women who have survived a heart attack, what was it like?","My mum had a heart attack at 51.  She had struggled with heart burn for years anyway, so when she had those feelings she wasn’t too concerned.  She woke up in the night and was vomiting and my dad went to help her.  He said that she went all floppy and clammy and very pale.  My dad was in the army for 24 years and he’s had some medical training so he guessed she was having a heart attack and called 999 immediately.  My mum didn’t even want him to call the ambulance because she didn’t think it could be that serious. 

When they arrived they did tests and said that she had had a heart attack.  She was denying it even to the paramedics! I don’t know the exact details of it but she had a blockage and they removed it by going through her vein and into her artery (again, I don’t know the exact details).  She had smoked since she was 15 so she quit straight away and cleaned up her diet, as well as going on several medications.  4 years later and she’s fine! She was also diagnosed as pre-diabetic but she’s managed to control that.

I wasn’t actually there for any of this because this took place during my first year at uni.  But yeah, even my mum, in the midst of a heart attack, was denying that she was having a heart attack.  Medical advice is so clearly aimed at men, and it could have cost my mum her life if my dad hadn’t been there and acted on his instinct and knowledge.",745,gcp1b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/gcp1b8/women_who_have_survived_a_heart_attack_what_was/,101,1588533998.0,,2020-05-03 15:26:38

How do you stop taking things to heart and be laid back?,"Assume the best of others. Often when people lash out, it's because they're projecting their feelings about themselves onto others. Maybe they're having a shitty day or a shitty year or they have a history of trauma that causes them to react in less-than-ideal ways. That has nothing to do with you. 

Also, realising you're responsible for your feelings and your own projections, too. Learn how to hold solid boundaries with others and with yourself. I find most of my resentment crops up when people cross boundaries that I haven't articulated. Learning how to talk about my boundaries and actively enforce them when needed has helped me become a lot more peaceful with myself and others.",37,hobwlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/hobwlx/how_do_you_stop_taking_things_to_heart_and_be/,38,1594359382.0,,2020-07-10 01:36:22
How do you stop taking things to heart and be laid back?,"I agree with a lot of these comments, but it’s also important to remember that “being laid back” for a lot of people means to just let people treat you how they like without having natural emotional reactions depending on how they’re acting. Women get pressured into being “cool”, “easy going”, and “laid back” way too much, often at the expense of their own well-being. Be true to your emotions and your heart, honor them and voice them, and ALSO learn when to pick your battles. Also, being extra sensitive or emotional isn’t some god-awful crime. Having a tender heart is a great quality to have for so many reasons.

No? Easy then, their opinion doesn’t matter. I know who I am, they don’t. 

Yes? Maybe I should reconsider having them in my life. If what they are saying is out of genuine love, consider what they’re saying and know it’s most likely not meant to hurt me, but help me. If it’s not out of love and to hurt me, then they don’t deserve to be in my life.

As the following day was Valentine's Day, and as he had made it seem like he was asking me on a date, I got pretty excited. Got all dressed up to meet him at the restaurant. He then proceeded to tell me, ""I know you have a huge crush on me, but I just don't think a relationship between us would work."" He laid out his reasons, some of which I agreed with (we would have to drive 3-4 hours each way to see each other, since he lived in another city) and some of which I didn't.

I had to finish out the rest of that dinner with a total poker face even though I was sad AF, and to make matters worse, we'd had plans to go to another friend's Valentine's Day party afterward, so I had to go there and dance/drink/pretend to be happy, despite being really deeply sad and embarrassed.",10,kphts0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/kphts0/whats_the_most_brutal_way_someones_rejected_you/,19,1609695594.0,,2021-01-03 12:39:54

Have you or anyone you know had a near death experience (ie. been clinically dead for a minute or so) and what did you/they experience in that moment?,"My dad had a heart attack and spent over 7 minutes without oxygen. He was paddle shocked 5 times and now jokes ""when I die...again..."". He says there was absolutely nothing. No ""white light"", no ""seeing your whole life before your eyes"". Nothing. He said it wasn't even scary since there just wasn't anything. The most jarring thing for him was that he woke up from his medically induced coma earlier than they expected and they didn't have anyone available to pull out his breathing tube, so he was awake for a good 10 hours before they could remove it. He was looking at us very oddly, but couldn't verbalize what the deal was. Apparently all his colors were jumbled and my very white mom looked almost eggplant purple to him. His black nurse wasn't a normal person color at all. When he was finally able to talk he asked my mom why she was purple. Then he asked the nurse if she was black, but he fought with finding words that weren't offensive until he stopped caring about trying and just blurted out ""are you black?!""",10,kqifhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/kqifhk/have_you_or_anyone_you_know_had_a_near_death/,18,1609824517.0,,2021-01-05 00:28:37

Being 2 at the time, I only remember bits of what happened.  But the most vivid memory I have was feeling incredibly empowered.  There was a point where I stood up in my crib holding  the doll shaped pillow my mom had made, looking out the window and thinking how important it was to protect the people I saw walking around outside the hospital.

Have you or anyone you know had a near death experience (ie. been clinically dead for a minute or so) and what did you/they experience in that moment?,"In June of 2020, my Dad collapsed in our yard while helping us mow the lawn. He's an older guy, 3-time cancer survivor with dizziness issues but this was a worse fall than we'd ever seen him. He insisted to my Mom that he was fine, and that she didn't need to worry about him. We were both skeptical, but we took his word and kept a close eye on him for the rest of the day.

Fast forward to a cardiology appointment I took him to in October. He was joking with his nurse that he didn't know why he even had a pacemaker put in back in 2015 or so, since it's not like it did anything when she looked him dead in the eyes and said, ""I beg to differ.""

Turns out his collapse was a heart attack, and he flatlined. If it wasn't for the pacemaker in his chest shocking his heart back into rhythm, he would have died right then and there. The good news is they figured out where the blockage was in his heart that caused the problem, and put a stent in. So he's doing alright, all things considered.

He later admitted to my Mom and I that it felt like he was being buried. He kept trying to climb out of the pit he was in, towards a bright light, but he never could get anywhere. And then he woke up. He didn't want to tell us when it happened, because he knew we would bring him to the ER.",10,kqifhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/kqifhk/have_you_or_anyone_you_know_had_a_near_death/,18,1609824517.0,,2021-01-05 00:28:37

I have a couple of best friends, and I see one more than the other - coincidence with our schedules, and our closer proximity.

I would get a book from his bookshelf or make myself a cup of tea and lie in bed until he woke cause I was an early riser. That was rummaging through his things. 

He would make plans - I wouldn’t ask to see him he would offer. Then two hours after we were supposed to have met, I’d finally get a text saying his mates were over. Then I was “hysterical” for being angry. 

He would chat with “models” on Instagram then tell me I was paranoid when I asked why he had blocked my profile.

I'm noticing a massive difference in those who'll ask and those who pry. Those who ask have this air of acceptance, and it's all going to be ok, and it's those I'll feel it's ok to be vulnerale with and admit my mental health struggles to and lack of answer to most things. Then there are those who push for answer, deciding there's always something wrong and those people just make me feel backed into an emotional corner.

when I REALLY like someone I’ll make a playlist for them, filled with songs that they like, that remind me of them, that I think they’ll like, etc. and I just throw a bunch of songs their way. they usually don’t listen to it, and if they do they’re just like “aw thanks” but I could go for hours on end about why I decided to dedicate the song for them.
if someone EVER made me a playlist or dedicated songs to me, I really wouldn’t know how to act. I’d roll around on my bed and kick everywhere like a giant baby.
some other things I turn into a big softie for are good senses of humor (like teasing, bullying, being able to roast each other, etc.), skin-ship, and the ability to be completely comfortable in front of one another. like yes, your loud and obnoxious laugh is so adorable, your loud sneezes are hilarious, your little snores are so cute, pls.

What’s a way to your heart?,"I’m a self titled crazy cat lady and I’ve had this cat since I found him 12 years ago as a kitten. He’s my best friend and when I first met my husband I was sub letting and couldn’t have my cat in the apartment. When I finally moved out on my own I was so excited to be able to bring my baby back and my husband said something that was just the sweetest thing. He said he was worried about meeting my kitty and what if my cat didn’t like him? My husband wasn’t really a cat person at all until he met me and the fact that he’d really never had an interaction with a cat before but realized how much my kitty meant to me was just the sweetest thing ever. He was almost as nervous to meet my cat as someone would be about meeting their partners parents or something. 

Of course my cat loved him and now if I ever go away for the weekend or something my husband will send me pictures of them having a little guys weekend. We also adopted another cat of our own and my husband helps me feed/care for the feral cats outside our house and supports me when I foster kittens or pick kittens up off the side of the road.

What’s a way to your heart?,"I like people who respect my interests or are willing to try and understand. I breed snakes, mostly ball pythons, and a lot of people act terribly when I tell them. The reactions are normally ""What if it eats you"" or ""Ew but they're slimy"" or ""I hate snakes"". People say this but no one actually knows anything about snakes. 

For example, ball pythons are very docile and will never bite (unless you step on them or smell like a rat). They are also not venomous, could not possibly eat anything bigger than a baseball, and are the equivalent of a very chunky rope. And no, snakes are not slimy, they are actually very soft like holding pizza dough.

Sent me a single gold-dipped rose from Steven Singer (not even $80), for no reason.

What’s a way to your heart?,"Each person is different and has different needs. Love language is the way to nail this,  Gary Smally has written a book. Mine are acts of services and gifts( these can be a very small things)I need a minimum amount of words, but a lot of woman do need this.

What do you do to heal after a breakup?,"Firstly, so sorry you’re feeling so rubbish! I totally understand how you feel. I went through the worst break up of my life last year and it was HORRENDOUS. I’m not going to lie, you’re probably going to feel pretty bad for a while but I can promise you that you are going through the worst of it right now. The only thing that’s going to get you through it is time (I know, everyone says that and you want to tell them to fuck off) but the good news is there are things to help time move quicker (and less painfully!) Here’s a list of things that helped me personally. 

- WALKING!! 

Even when you feel like you’d rather be swallowed up by your bed sheets amidst listening to Coldplay I guarantee you getting fresh air is vital. You might cry in public (that’s normal) but force yourself to get out and expel that negative energy by moving forward. 

- CRYING WHEN YOU NEED TO

Just let it out. Sob, like the GUT WRENCHING kind of sob. You will feel better for it. 

- JOURNALING 

I have a whole ass google doc of letters to my ex. It was cathartic at the time which is why I think it’s a great idea. Now I read them and laugh. 

- BLOCK THEM ON EVERYTHING

I was reluctant to do this for about 2 months because I didn’t want to look like an asshole. But unless you can promise to yourself that you’re not going to stalk your ex, blocking will be necessary for you to get over them. Trust me. 

You will get past this. You will look back at this in a few months and laugh at yourself. Happier days are ahead of you and there are lots of good times to be had although it might not feel like it. You will miss them, terribly, especially when your life was so intertwined but here is an opportunity that the universe has granted you to be your own person. Push that anger into new skills for you, for new gains and new experiences that you will benefit from. All the best!",24,kub8e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/kub8e6/what_do_you_do_to_heal_after_a_breakup/,46,1610298537.0,Feeling so incredibly heart broken right now And random bouts of grief just hits me in waves.,2021-01-10 12:08:57
What do you do to heal after a breakup?,"How long has it been for you? I'm 3 weeks in and they still come in waves. But I have a dog so that gets me up everyday, and I've been doing chores. I vacuum EVERY SINGLE DAY. Listen to music, someday you'll dance and sing along.  Talk to some friends or family.

What do you do to heal after a breakup?,"Allow yourself to cry when you need to, check in with friends and arrange phone calls/video chats about whatever, and take the time you need. My relationship recently ended too and the first few days were tough and I didn't want to see or hear anything happy or romantic lol but it's been almost two weeks now and I'm enjoying romcom movies and stuff again. Also, and this is kinda a more random one, Taylor Swift's new album Evermore has really helped me. It just feels like the epitome of healing for me and I've found peace in my situation with every song on it. Not to be cheesy, but some lyrics from her song 'Happiness' are 'there'll be happiness after you, but there was happiness because of you. Both of these things can be true, there is happiness'. And that really helped me.

What do you do to heal after a breakup?,"I found out on New Years that my ex what cheating on me. We weren't together long, honestly one of my shortest relationships, but it hit HARD. I think in all my past relationships the end came slow, I knew it was happening, so by the time I ended it I was beyond ready. This one, I had about 2 minutes to make a decision upon finding out and not nearly enough time to grieve it. 

I spent the weekend getting drunk, crying, and eating anything in sight. Then I started to make myself move. Working out is a passion of mine and I need to do it to feel like myself. So I got into the gym, I ran a few miles, I just kept moving. The more I keep pretending to do the things I used to do, the more I feel like me. I started journaling, just letting the words flow as they needed to. I'm sure what I wrote would make no sense upon re-reading, but that doesn't matter.  I also started planning my future. I wanted to take a trip this summer (covid friendly) so I went ahead and booked it. I'll go solo, I'll do what I want to do, and life will be just fine. 

Basically, grieve. Take time to sit on the couch and cry. Then get moving, fake it until you start to believe it.",24,kub8e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/kub8e6/what_do_you_do_to_heal_after_a_breakup/,46,1610298537.0,Feeling so incredibly heart broken right now And random bouts of grief just hits me in waves.,2021-01-10 12:08:57
What do you do to heal after a breakup?,"Cry when you need to cry. Let it out. Reach out to your support system and be honest about how you feel. Don’t hide anything or hold back. Let everything out. I find the best way to get over a heartbreak is going straight through it, don’t try to avoid it. Then think about all the things you want in the next partner, things that may have been lacking with this one. Think about the things you won’t accept next time. Think about the pieces of yourself you sacrificed, changed or held back to be with this person. Make a list of all of your amazing qualities and remind yourself how great and capable you are on your own. Don’t rush to find someone else. Be okay with being on your own and be kind to yourself. Give yourself some grace.",24,kub8e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/kub8e6/what_do_you_do_to_heal_after_a_breakup/,46,1610298537.0,Feeling so incredibly heart broken right now And random bouts of grief just hits me in waves.,2021-01-10 12:08:57
What do you do to heal after a breakup?,"I got dumped a month ago before Christmas so I was feeling blue though now I’m glad we split. 

First breakup I ever had (few months ago) I had a day to feel like crap about myself then I got all dressed up, did my hair and appreciated myself and realized he wasn’t what I wanted in a partner and reminded myself what I’m worth. He hurt my feelings with an attack on my boundaries, he was immature when I made things clear from the beginning. I deserve respect. 

Second break up (a month ago) I reflected on the reasons why we split and see it’s for the better. We all have different needs and neither of ours were being met. We’re two very different people who want and need different things. I also realized again what I deserve in a partner, he wasn’t it. I’m glad for the breakup. 

It’s important to reflect on why things ended, how you can learn from the relationship and refocus on how you can improve yourself and better find who you’re looking for. 

Never forget your worth. Build yourself back up and learn from that relationship. I also think it’s important to process your feelings, if it’s hurt, anger, disappointment, fear. It’s ok to feel however you feel, just don’t suppress it. Take time to heal before plunging back in. You heal in your own time.


Its been interesting for me since my most recent ex works right across from me in a different department. I’m able to go about my job duties and don’t mind interacting but he’s avoiding me (used to come over daily before we even dated for drinks, now he’s never over). I think he’s making things awkward. We’re both adults, why aren’t we both acting like it? Maybe I’m the weird one but I just think the mature way for us to handle this is to go about things normally. 

Sorry, got off topic. 


I’m sorry you’re hurting, I’m here if you need an ear. Just remember you’re worth more than they could give, you’re worthy of love.  Hoping the best for you!

Meditation/Yoga

Walking outside

Calling friends and family to talk (not just about the breakup)

Write a letter to yourself. Tell yourself about your strengths and what you deserve in a relationship. Keep the letter and read it to yourself when you feel really low. 

Write a letter to your ex. Tell him/her everything you didn’t get a chance to say. After you write it, shred it or burn it.

Like at the beach, there would be lots of ice cream, and cheesy movies, and other women to talk to  and wine.   I digress.    What I did was whatever I needed to to get through it Knowing that each day was easier, and that the pain I was feeling was only temporary that I would get through to the other side, but that I had to feel the pain to get to the other side.   I often picked a series to binge watch. In the older days that was on DVDs but now you can do netflix.  Gilmore Girls, NCIS was one, the Good Witch, Cedar Cove.  Reach out to friends.

What does a heartbreak feel like?,"the worst case is when my body was faced with inconsistent numbness and pain throughout. my legs and arms would feel numb whilst an intense heat spread from my chest that made it hard to breathe. nausea was constant since it felt like my stomach was trying to turn in on itself so I lost appetite. my heart either felt like it was being squeeze or struck with a searing hot knife. and my mind was either numb with a fuzzy fog of relief or met with a bombardment of sadness, confusion, and shame. I always locked myself away if it got too much since I couldn’t stop the tears, and even those burned my cheeks. it’s just takes a lot of energy and hurts, not rewarding you with much positivity but rather numbness which was lonely. it can really hurt sometimes.",11,k7m4o4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/k7m4o4/what_does_a_heartbreak_feel_like/,37,1607254465.0,,2020-12-06 06:34:25

On the day I had decided to get the heart tattoo, I learned that a heart on the wrist was a variation of the whole “to write love on her arms” movement. That solidified my decision right then and there.

The guy who did it was understandably a bit irked to have to tattoo it until I explained the story. He apologized for judging, as he should have.

It’s understated and most people don’t know I have it because it’s usually tucked under my watch, but it has brought me closer to the people who have noticed.

Popular, and specific to Black Women, the poem, ""Still I Rise""

You may write me down in history

With your bitter, twisted lies,

You may trod me in the very dirt

But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?

Why are you beset with gloom?

’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells

Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,

With the certainty of tides,

Just like hopes springing high,

Still I'll rise.

Did you want to see me broken?

Bowed head and lowered eyes?

Shoulders falling down like teardrops,

Weakened by my soulful cries?

Does my haughtiness offend you?

Don't you take it awful hard

’Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines

Diggin’ in my own backyard.


You may shoot me with your words,

You may cut me with your eyes,

You may kill me with your hatefulness,

But still, like air, I’ll rise.


Does my sexiness upset you?

Does it come as a surprise

That I dance like I've got diamonds

At the meeting of my thighs?


Out of the huts of history’s shame

I rise

Up from a past that’s rooted in pain

I rise

I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,

Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.

Leaving behind nights of terror and fear

I rise

Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear

I rise

Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,

I am the dream and the hope of the slave.

I rise

I rise

I rise.",18,jxjss0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/jxjss0/what_is_a_quote_or_saying_that_has_really_stuck/,43,1605881064.0,,2020-11-20 09:04:24

 “Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won't either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. You have to love. You have to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could.”

He designed it online and later broke down his thought process - how the bands were really thin to accentuate my long thin hands or how the size of the stone he went with (1.25 ct) was the best size for the width of my finger.

What made you stay with someone you knew in your heart wasn’t the right one?,"Because I knew that as far as humans go, he was wonderful. I was afraid of letting go. I was afraid I was being ungrateful and that I would be making the biggest mistake by letting the relationship end and that I wouldn't find anyone better. He was sweet and never once made me feel like I was less than. He cared about me. Might sound silly but we never had big arguments and we definitely never fought. We both went with a flow. However our individual life directions and pace didn't align and were at different angles, (not regarding personalities, that wasn't an issue) but like any set of lines, unless they are the same line or parallel, the smallest difference in angle will eventually grow until the two lines aren't even on the same paper as the space and difference grows larger. Unfortunately we weren't in the right places in life that would have allowed us to merge our lines. From the beginning I had a doubt in my gut, I even had a small doubt in the back of my mind about how I felt about him on a romantic level before things were official, but he was such a kind and wholesome person that I was also afraid of wondering what if and regretting not trying. Also my parents at the time put a big rift between us. I will forever appreciate his existence and the friendship he shared. I never once regretted meeting him. I knew from the time I met him that I was supposed to know him and we were meant to be friends, eventually during the relationship, I started to really worry that maybe we over stepped and went too far by being more than friends bc I knew he and I connected like puzzle pieces... but I also had a feeling we were simply not in the right time of our lives and possibly not the ultimate ones for each other... that might sound like a cop out... but its the shortest way I can put it.

They say 2 good people if devoted to each other can make things work... but there's 3 levels to good things in life: Good, better, and best. We were without a doubt Good for each other. We were even possibly better for each other. But I dont think we were necessarily best for each other.

How did you get back on track and enjoy your job/working again after extreme burnout? Any success stories?,"It was the never ending workload and long work hours with no paid overtime or appreciation which made me burnout, I ended up deciding to leave the company.  
I ended up choosing a company which had a different mentality (this has also failed haha, but this time I don't have burn out and I'll be moving onto a better job/company in the new year), and allowed me to have freedom in what I was doing etc.  


It'll take time, building up the confidence again is the hardest thing. Being the in right environment and speaking up about issues has definitely helped me out the most in my recovery. In time it heals, also surrounding yourself with a good support network or someone to rant about this kind of thing helps (heck a friend, or even a therapist).

How did you get back on track and enjoy your job/working again after extreme burnout? Any success stories?,"Taking a break. That's what I did. I realise not everyone has the luxury to do so, but I had savings plus my life situation was such that I could easily do it. 

I did continue to work with independent clients during my break (not planned, but somehow got new mini projects my way), and actually ended up earning more money during that time with much, much lesser work, which is a little crazy. I did join a regular job after a couple of months, once I felt mentally ready for it. So totally back on track, though I'd argue that I wasn't totally off the track. The break worked out brilliant for me since I was able to get a much needed breather from a super hectic and mentally taxing job, travel a bit, get some independent clients out of nowhere and was also financially secure.

The biggest lesson I learnt from my burnout was that I must always take some time out to do the things I love. I might be brilliant at my job, but that doesn't mean my performance will always be good enough - people can and will find faults. And if I don't do any activities that feed my soul, that messes with my mind.

I will add that a break is not for everyone - I know people who cannot live without a job for more than a week and who went into depression because they willingly left a job (even though they were financially stable). As much as I enjoy my work, I know I'm not one of those and the break was the best thing I could do for myself at that point.",135,k9ubgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/k9ubgp/how_did_you_get_back_on_track_and_enjoy_your/,25,1607558045.0,"If my boss knew how little I was working I’d likely be fired.

How did you get back on track and enjoy your job/working again after extreme burnout? Any success stories?,"I'm still working through this myself but I will add that prioritizing yourself is key! I'm a people pleaser by nature, so previously in my life I tried to say yes to anything I think that others would want me to. This involves both employment and social things. When I realized that my burnout was critical (and i became concerned that i would be unable to perform my job if i let the stress get a bunch worse) i started saying NO. Politely but firmly.

Examples. Employer assumed i could work late one day without asking. Usually I would suck it up, this time I talk to them about it and say that i actually can't work beyond scheduled hours today. Usually I'd be happy to, but i tell them to please ask me next time to see if I am available after working hours. Taking the control but also being reasonable about it made me feel less stressed.

Family (prior to covid restrictions) wants me to hang out multiple days in a row. I say no, I spent good quality time with you yesterday and need today to be by myself and recharge. I can not control that my family has higher social needs than I do, nor can I control that I have a higher need right now to recharge. 

It's like you almost have to get over the guilt you feel from (the potential of) letting others down. I think a lot of burnout is connected to this- you get worn down by the high expectations at work, and this can trickle into your personal life as well.",135,k9ubgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/k9ubgp/how_did_you_get_back_on_track_and_enjoy_your/,25,1607558045.0,"If my boss knew how little I was working I’d likely be fired.

How did you get back on track and enjoy your job/working again after extreme burnout? Any success stories?,"I recommend a couple of things:

- If you have paid time off, use it. Usually a long weekend here or there when I feel the burnout coming on is enough. Unplug from work completely. Don't check emails, don't talk about work, go do something that takes you completely out of the work mindset, like camping or hiking.

- Set healthy boundaries at work. Do not check emails after hours, don't respond to emails on weekends, and block out time on your calendar each day to have a healthy lunch and take a walk. People will catch on that you're not available during work hours and stop asking you for things outside of your 9 - 5.

- Meditation. The InsightTimer app is amazing. Tons of guided meditation for all experience levels. Sleep music, affirmations, etc. It feels awkward at first, but meditation has gotten me through some serious shit.

- Assess if what you are doing is really what you want to do. I currently work on a team and at a company where the culture tries to take over your life. I love the work, but the expectations to regularly work overtime without any recognition has quickly become exhausting. I refuse to allow a job to take over my life. See the point about setting healthy boundaries above. If people don't respect the boundaries, or you do all of the above and you're still burned out, it's time to decide if you're really doing what you love. Plenty of people switch roles, companies, or careers. 

Ultimately, you have to remember that a job is just a job. You are a whole person with hopes and dreams, limitations and needs. Honor yourself. My favorite quote is ""quit killing yourself for a job that will replace you within a week if you died."" No one ever found themselves on their death bead and said ""Gee, I wish I had put in more hours at the office.""",135,k9ubgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/k9ubgp/how_did_you_get_back_on_track_and_enjoy_your/,25,1607558045.0,"If my boss knew how little I was working I’d likely be fired.

How did you get back on track and enjoy your job/working again after extreme burnout? Any success stories?,"This could just be me, but I spoke to my doctor about it. My ""burnout"" was really terrible fatigue. I would have to drink 3-4 sodas a day at work to stay awake and do the bare minimum, then I went home and fell asleep by 8 pm (I got home around 7 pm). 

I knew this wasn't normal, and it had been going on for a couple of months with no improvement, so I asked my doctor. We did some tests, and I got on ADHD medicine as an adult in their 20's who never demonstrated the ""typical"" ADHD traits as a child. It has turned my life around. I now realize how all of my coworkers accomplished so much in a workday.

Also, even if it isn't ADHD, there are a lot of medical issues that can give you that ""burnout"" feeling. I always blamed my fatigue on burnout because I did have a very stressful job, but in reality, the stress was just making my actual issues worse.",135,k9ubgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/k9ubgp/how_did_you_get_back_on_track_and_enjoy_your/,25,1607558045.0,"If my boss knew how little I was working I’d likely be fired.

How did you get back on track and enjoy your job/working again after extreme burnout? Any success stories?,"I was fortunate in that my spouse and I were both in the same position: working extremely hard and making good money but not able to exist outside of work. So we agreed that we would do it for one more year and committed to saving as much as we could, and then took almost two years off. 

We travelled on a working holiday visa. We reevaluated our priorities and decided to both transition into industries/careers that would allow us to achieve the desired life style and also give us more control over options in the future. 

I chose software engineering and put some of the last of our savings into a bootcamp. Last month I started in an incredible role with a major company.

How did you get back on track and enjoy your job/working again after extreme burnout? Any success stories?,Look. This is not a helpful answer but its an honest one. I took two years off. I used to work in IT and had some savings and also have access to welfare payments when the savings were getting really low. I did some part time study but not much else. I was insanely burntout though. Im not at the functioning level I was at before but I have recovered quite a bit of it.  I also had some comorbid issues particularly undiagnosed autism that was parading as anxiety that made the burnout completely full on so my experience is on the more intense end I think.,135,k9ubgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/k9ubgp/how_did_you_get_back_on_track_and_enjoy_your/,25,1607558045.0,"If my boss knew how little I was working I’d likely be fired.

How did you know you needed to make a drastic life change?,"When you show too much care people seem to walk all over you. I'm a very emotional person but I don't show it now. I don't want people to know what I am now. Since I was little people have been taking me for granted. I changed myself because it became too much. There were many things that led to this but the most was:
When my best friend stopped talking to me this year. It was the first friendship I had. We both girls knew each other since the first day of college. She had and still has bad influence in life. I tried my best to change it but it backfired on me pretty bad.
 I discussed some issues about her to her friends and they ratted me out in a bad way that made her hurt. I tried to explain and apologize but she just won't listen she stopped talking to me- no contact whatsoever . So I then realised that i wasn't that wrong and I just wanted her back. I think it was dumb. 
Anyways,It's been a long time being alone and it really hurts to be lonely. I try to keep myself away from all negative things and I started to make myself a better person. It's been okay and thinking it too shall pass helps.",8,jurkca,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/jurkca/how_did_you_know_you_needed_to_make_a_drastic/,17,1605496782.0,,2020-11-15 22:19:42

How did you know you needed to make a drastic life change?,"I did this recently so, for me, I was miserable. As in, feel it in my bones miserable. Had no energy to shower or eat or make an effort miserable. Nothing was bringing me joy anymore. While, yes, some of it was my chronic mental illness and the pandemic, the fact that I couldn’t name a single thing in my life that I was happy or even just content with was a big red flag for me.

How did you know you needed to make a drastic life change?,"I went to the store and picked up a few things before the weekend. Got home, roommate was there. Held up the bananas I bought and said, ""I got these bananas, you're welcome to have them, but they are mine, so please don't eat them all."" She responded by saying ""what the f you knew I wanted bananas why the hell wouldn't you get me some??"" I laughed at first then realized she was dead serious and absolutely furious that I had offered to SHARE my bananas with her, but not GIVE them to her. I don't even know if she heard that she could have some or if she just heard that they weren't all for her and then turned into a 3 year old. The whole situation was so absurd that I stood there holding the bananas for several minutes while she fumed and shook her head, clearly furious that I hadn't read her mind and done her shopping for her. I could have corrected her, explained that actually I had just said that they were for BOTH of us, but I just... didn't. I had been excusing her increasingly immature behavior and outbursts for months, and that was it. Holding bananas I had bought because I knew she wanted them, but clarifying that hey, I want one, too, and having it thrown in my face as somehow a terrible thing to do, I decided I just didn't need to deal with this crap anymore.

This isn't the whole truth; it's true, but it leaves out the fact that I don't want children and never have, so learning I can't have them anyway was something of a relief, not something I'm unhappy or upset about. However, if I can make the sort of person who does this feel bad about their awful presumption, I figure they might not do it again - to someone it *would* really upset.

How did you deal with the dramatic increase in people asking when (not if!) you’re having children after getting married?,"Husband and I got married 2.5y ago. I have literally never wanted children, and my husband feels the same.

Day after our wedding, his mother asked me 'so, when are you having children?' I said never, and she said 'oh, I'm sure you'll change your mind.'

I completely avoided all conversations like that with her. My husband got cancer, and the ONLY benefit was the chemo may have rendered him infertile (something we're checking out). He accidentally told him mother that, and she was like 'oh, okay, well I'm okay with you not having children.' 

I told her 'I'm glad you're happy, but it's not your uterus.'

My parents have been fantastic about me never having kids, and my dad frequently shuts down his parents (my grandparents) when they ask about great-grandchildren. 

I tell coworkers, friends, random people who ask 'I don't want to have children. It's my uterus, so it's my decision.' Dropping the U-bomb generally makes it awkward, and they stop (I kind of enjoy it). The one person who kept pushing with 'Oh, but accidents happen!' was met with 'And they can be taken care of.'

I told her that we decided not to have children, and that we both clearly agreed on this.

She said that we may think this now, but by the time he's in his mid to upper-40s, biology will make him really want to reproduce. And, she said, I better be prepared to get divorced because I'll be too old to have kids by then. ""Better change your mind before you're too old if you don't want to get divorced!""

How did you deal with the dramatic increase in people asking when (not if!) you’re having children after getting married?,"Depends on the person and how it is asked. If they are rude, I'm rude back. If they were being nice but thoughtless, I respond in kind. I always told my parents that I wanted to adopt from foster care. I had been married 3 years when I posted a picture of my husband and I filling out the foster care/adoption intake forms. My mother called me a few minutes after I posted the picture in tears and said, ""So you really aren't going to have children, are you?"" I don't know why she didn't believe me, but I had been saying I didn't want kids since I was ten. I'm almost 39 now and I still haven't changed my mind. Also, I adopted one kid from foster care and now have two foster teens. Here's something I wasn't aware would happen though. My teenagers are amazing girls, but also LOOOOVVVEEEE babies. And they tell me several times a week that I should have a baby. I tell them they are my babies, but obviously that isn't good enough.

I didn’t get a chance to ask you guys before, since you were newly dating, but when will you guys have kids?!” I was really surprised, what kind of fucking question is that??

When I was younger I always had this neat little timeline for my future self: meet partner in mid-20s, date for 2 years, yet engaged, marry a year later, have first child 2 years after that at around age 30. Turns out - GASP! - reality is a lot more complicated. My boyfriend and I have some communication issues I want to work out before committing to marriage. And as for kids, I’m about to start a 5 year doctoral program, and I’m struggling with whether to have my first kid when I’m in school, constantly working and not earning an income, or wait until I’m in my late 30s.

How did you deal with the dramatic increase in people asking when (not if!) you’re having children after getting married?,"It's infuriating. My husband and I had a baby 2 years after getting married but the asking was non-stop the second we said 'I do'. And guess what, they now ask when the next one's coming (he's 4 months old, and we only want one!) Honestly, I'd say we want to travel, progress our careers and enjoy our life together as a couple without children thank you.

It will literally never stop. I'm sure most people are just trying to make conversation, but unless you're my husband or like, my close personal friends, I don't owe you any conversation or explaination about my family planning. 

So to answer your questions, if I'm in a good mood I'll laugh them off. If I'm in a bad mood, I might say something like I hated being pregnant or having another would financial ruin us.

Now, I just plain roll my eyes at their face. Or say I already have a furry one (my puppy).

I know it's not a good thing, and that there are people who actually want children and can't have them, but this has gotten to the point where I'm always so constantly upset by it that I want them to feel guilty.

I've even stopped playing with others' children because if I do, I will be showered with this idiotic pressure every single person in the world feels entitled to put on women, even the ones that aren't close to me at all.",2065,ibx7h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/ibx7h9/how_did_you_deal_with_the_dramatic_increase_in/,566,1597768538.0,"Edit: thank you so much for the overwhelming response and advice!

How did you deal with the dramatic increase in people asking when (not if!) you’re having children after getting married?,"My dad brought it up on my wedding day. Luckily I didn’t hear it. 

When it was brought up in holiday dinner prayers, I interjected with “I want a dog”. I’ll make it awkward, idc. 
The best thing to happen so far was my uncle (who’s like late 30s) and my aunt had a baby so my grandparents have chilled tfo on baby talk with my husband(29) and me(30). What kills me is I have cousins in other states that have babies, making my grandparents great-grandparents, but because they aren’t around them, the TWO grandkids here get the baby comments. My brother is like 25 and JUST found a stable and wonderful gf. Leave him alone. 
You want to be around babies? Go volunteer to hold babies at the hospital. Leave my uterus be. 

When we talk with friends about being asked & swap stories, we say that we have more we wanted to accomplish before possibly having kids. If kids magically happen, we’ll be parents. Until then, we ain’t trying to be parents. 

I’m still trying to figure out if I’m the aunt type or the mom type.

1. they can't have them

Also I stand by any of you guys who don't want kids for any reason. It's your life. It's your body. It's your choice.

 My counter argument is that I'm saving the money from not having kids to pay for someone to take care of me. Sometimes if she's really digging in I'll mention if she expects her kids to take care of her (they live in a different state) and when she says no I ask her why I should expect differently then 🙄

How did you deal with the dramatic increase in people asking when (not if!) you’re having children after getting married?,"I tell them that I'm not interested in having children at all, since I grew up raising my sisters and that my fiance has epilepsy and his grand mal seizures are triggered by sleep deprivation. We both just aren't big fans of children either, but most people won't accept that as an answer on its own.

My sister in law asked me pretty much every time I saw her, when we were going to have kids because her and my brother are on the fast track to getting married and having many kids (she's 33 and he's 30 and they both love children). Then, when we were camping with them, my fiance didn't sleep much one night and was having some pretty intense pre-seizure twitches, so I was essentially putting him in recovery position and making sure he was safe before letting him rest for a while. The feeling eventually passed, thankfully, but after that, she told me that she realized that it would be potentially harmful for us to have a baby and hasn't talked to me about it since.",2065,ibx7h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/ibx7h9/how_did_you_deal_with_the_dramatic_increase_in/,566,1597768538.0,"Edit: thank you so much for the overwhelming response and advice!

How did you deal with the dramatic increase in people asking when (not if!) you’re having children after getting married?,"I got married last year and kids have always been our plan. But to anyone that asks when we’re having children, I just reply, “When we’re ready”. I think it works for anyone because if you aren’t planning on having kids, your personal “when” is never. 

I do think of it as something of a compliment though, to be asked. To me it indicates that the person asking thinks well enough of me and my husband that they hope for more our influence in the world. That’s definitely how I feel about my friends and some of my family members when they decide to have kids. :)",2065,ibx7h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/ibx7h9/how_did_you_deal_with_the_dramatic_increase_in/,566,1597768538.0,"Edit: thank you so much for the overwhelming response and advice!

How did you deal with the dramatic increase in people asking when (not if!) you’re having children after getting married?,"I'm still a college student and not married but I, as childfree, would like to say this.

To all of you getting these questions ""when are you going to have kid"" stay really firm and honest 'We're not having kids. We don't need them and don't want them'. You can always use clever and humorous ways to answer as a way to shut down the comments like saying ""When pigs fly"" or ""When you stop asking"". And if they try to press you on, pressure you or try to bingo you (when people try to guilt trip you and change your mind) there's a bunch of clever comebacks and answers you can say to shut them down. If you want to you can visit r/childfree or r/nonchildfree to get ideas.

It's not okay for people to try and pressure you to have children when you don't want them. You know yourself, not them. In fact it's really dangerous to pressure people to have children because you never know who this person is and what they are actually going through financially, mentally and physically and relationship wise.",2065,ibx7h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/ibx7h9/how_did_you_deal_with_the_dramatic_increase_in/,566,1597768538.0,"Edit: thank you so much for the overwhelming response and advice!

First I asked who is this? Because I didn’t have the number saved. He told me and I though ugh yuck. I asked him what he wanted, he said just seeing how you are blah blah blah.

How much truth do you all think there is behind the statement “a drunk mind speaks a sober heart”?,"Lowered inhibitions can just as easily turn you into a brilliant actor as it can compel you to say things you normally wouldn't.

There's definitely something very, very wrong with assuming someone experiencing an unnatural, altered mental state is a more accurate reflection of who they are or what they think or feel. There are exceptions, of course, but those exceptions require further context to serve as evidence that it isn't just the alcohol.

For example, you can sort of deduce that someone who is kinder and more jovial while drunk is a more genuine version of themselves because the alcohol is making them forget about some serious problems/stress they're forgetting about.

But to do that, you need to literally psychoanalyze them on an individual basis and evaluate how likely that is based on what you know about them. It doesn't work as a rule.

Simple answer: Sometimes true, but dangerously unreliable.",83,dccdhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/dccdhl/how_much_truth_do_you_all_think_there_is_behind/,59,1570061501.0,"I’ve definitely said things and confessed feelings to people while being drunk that I never had the courage to say sober, and on the other hand I’ve also said things that I really didn’t mean and absolutely regretted it later on.

For example, something that might bother you when sober, but isn't important enough to bring up suddenly seems like a bigger deal when you're drunk because your rationality is impaired.

How much truth do you all think there is behind the statement “a drunk mind speaks a sober heart”?,"I think there’s some truth to it, maybe depending on what “type of drunk” someone is. 

For me personally, being drunk doesn’t change who I am or what I feel and think. It just lowers my inhibitions and eliminates the fear of being honest. 

I’ve been drunk many times, even black out drunk a couple times. But I’ve never said or done anything while drunk that wasn’t something I already wanted to do/say when I was sober, or that wasn’t based on something I felt when sober.

However, if someone tends to feel angry or irritable when they’re drunk I could see them saying something in anger that they later regret or don’t mean.",83,dccdhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/dccdhl/how_much_truth_do_you_all_think_there_is_behind/,59,1570061501.0,"I’ve definitely said things and confessed feelings to people while being drunk that I never had the courage to say sober, and on the other hand I’ve also said things that I really didn’t mean and absolutely regretted it later on.

How much truth do you all think there is behind the statement “a drunk mind speaks a sober heart”?,"Being drunk reduces your inhibitions and impairs your judgement.

That’s what it does. Both of those can lead you to saying things you are afraid to say, they can lead you to saying things you don’t mean, they can lead to you saying things that are factually wrong, yadda yadda. C’mon, being drunk isn’t some complex magical thing.

That being said, excessive liquid courage is a bit tricky.

How much truth do you all think there is behind the statement “a drunk mind speaks a sober heart”?,"I think there are people this absolutely applies to, and people it doesn't.

If someone has a habit of excusing themselves because they were drunk, and didn't mean it, I would say it applies to them, because it's a repeated thing.  

If someone is generally a decent person, drunk or not, and does something really out of character for them, it might have been a fluke.

I did weight watchers and discovered what a normal portion was and different creative ways of eating well but with fewer calories.

"Ladies who learned disordered eating habits from their mothers, how did you overcome body image issues and/or the unhealthy relationship with food?","It's definitely a work in progress.

I think I knew always that my mom's way was disordered. She developed heart issues  in her early 30s, around a time she was doing a lot of intense intermittent fasting (in the 1990s way before it was fashionable) - she still claims there was no relation, but I doubt it.

So I knew her approach was wrong. The problem is that I'm still on the way to figuring out the ""right"" approach for me, at 36.

I still have major issues with the size and look of my body, but I'm learning to feel better about it the more I challenge its physical abilities. My entire life, I never looked at food as fuel.

"Ladies who learned disordered eating habits from their mothers, how did you overcome body image issues and/or the unhealthy relationship with food?","I still have much of the disordered thinking in terms of my body, but as far as food, I found a best friend and a boyfriend that love and appreciate food. They both come from families that embrace and celebrate food. My best friend got me to try tons of different kinds of food in college (for example, I tried sushi for the first time with her). My boyfriend is an excellent cook and I’ve learned SOOOO much about food from him, so much about flavors, techniques, ingredients, etc. He helped me move away from food being this dark, ominous monster lurking everywhere I go and instead changed it to this infinite, technicolor world I could step into and *experience*. 

I love food now. I still struggle pretty hard with body image shit, but food is now a vehicle for me to experience different flavors and cultures, to find joy. Also, once you learn about the importance of quality ingredients and some staple flavor combinations, along with a few basic cooking techniques, you see just how easy it can be to create delicious food that is also healthy.",49,is2gos,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/is2gos/ladies_who_learned_disordered_eating_habits_from/,29,1600046881.0,,2020-09-13 21:28:01

I'll get back to you on how long it takes for me to relapse. They say refeeding syndrome gets worse every time you do it until (presumably) you die from it. So that's a motivator for me right now. 

Very few therapists do eating disorders for real, like they may have had patients with ED before but they're still probably pro diet and will encourage you to avoid triggering situations, etc, all the things that prolong your struggle. You gotta feel bad on purpose sometimes. It's hard and nobody knows how to support you through it.

"Women that have had heart attacks, what were your symptoms and how long did it take you to find help?","I had a heart attack at 28 caused by coronary artery spasm (prinzmetal’s angina). 
I had been feeling pretty bad on and off for 2 days, short of breath, felt exhausted, ‘tired’ feeling in my upper chest and left arm/shoulder. Like the muscle fatigue you feel if you’ve been using your arms above your head for too long. And lots palpitations. I was fine one minute and felt like I had been running a marathon the next, over and over.
Went to the GP twice those 2 days, but I was diagnosed with an anxiety attack and told I was hyperventilating. The evening of the second day it got worse, I was so very tired and my arm felt heavy, and I started getting nauseous. I was watching a movie with my BF, and at one point I told him I was feeling really bad and was going to bed. I got up from the couch, walked 3 steps and collapsed. He dialed the emergency services (I did wake up pretty soon and was able to walk back to the couch before they arrived), and when they arrived and hooked me up to a monitor I was told I was having a heart attack. 

I had no significant pain, more like a dull ache and tiredness, like muscle fatigue, left arm/shoulder and upper chest. The exhaustion was the worst, and I couldn’t walk two steps without getting winded and my heart beating out of my chest. And I knew something was VERY wrong.

I recovered fast and with no lasting damage by the way, and with medication it has not happened again.

Did you find a greater love after your first love broke your heart & how long after?,"During the months when my heartbreak was fresh it was hard to imagine I'd ever love the way I had loved again. And you know what? I never did love anyone else the way I loved my first. And I'm glad for it, because that first love wasn't healthy. I didn't keep myself safe or happy, because I thought I had to accept the pain for the sake of the person I loved.

The next person I fell in love with is now my spouse and I allow myself to be honest when I feel hurt - and better yet, he listens and actually makes an effort. He treats me like a human being and equal, not a pet, and he constantly reminds me that my health and safety are important. Although this time I'm not so selfless as I was before, he tells me that's a good thing because our relationship can only be healthy if we're both safe and happy, not just him.

My first relationship lingered in heartbreak and unhealthy dynamics for about a year, but I met my current spouse about a month after the final breakup with my ex, and I couldn't ask for a more wonderful partner.",31,dd2z8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/dd2z8i/did_you_find_a_greater_love_after_your_first_love/,34,1570195422.0,,2019-10-04 09:23:42
Did you find a greater love after your first love broke your heart & how long after?,"Yes, 10 years

Love evolves. It gets more refined. 

When I was with my high school sweetheart, the love was intense and had mostly an air of excitement and newness, but left me feeling lacking and lonely 

When I feel in love in my early 20’s and knew myself a little more it had and air of maturity and pridefulness, but left me feeling unsettled doubtful. 

I am mid 20’s and in love now and I feels intense and exciting, yet I also feel fulfilled and like I’ve found my best friend- the type of friend that sees you for who you are and not just the quality of time you spend. Alone, but never lonely. I’m older now, of course, and am obviously more mature, but a maturity that comes from knowing yourself just a little more- and knowing those around you. I am so proud of my partner. And instead of showing him off to everyone I just want to hug him and whisper it in his ear until he believes it. I feel like my body will never rest with the desire to toil for him, but my spirit feels more at home in my heart than it’s ever been.",31,dd2z8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/dd2z8i/did_you_find_a_greater_love_after_your_first_love/,34,1570195422.0,,2019-10-04 09:23:42

My husband loves me in a way that no one ever has before, and I don't think anyone else ever could. He protects me and takes care of me in every way possible, and I am so grateful my life turned out this way, because during that 4 years I had numerous moments where I truly believed I'd live my life as a spinster.",31,dd2z8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/dd2z8i/did_you_find_a_greater_love_after_your_first_love/,34,1570195422.0,,2019-10-04 09:23:42
Did you find a greater love after your first love broke your heart & how long after?,"I am not sure if your next love will be greater but it will be better. Your first love will always have a strong part of you because they taught you what love was. You will never have a love like that again. 

However, your first love will also teach you more about how you love and what you need in a partner. You will find a new love, a different love and they will either teach you another lesson or you will luckily find the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. 

It took me roughly 2 years to get over my first love. He never treated me poorly or anything like that, but we lived a dangerous lifestyle and he got put in prison for 25-life when I was 16. 

I later found a different love who taught me so much about myself and though he destroyed me, I do not regret it. 

I am now with the love I want to spend the rest of my life with. Of course there are still issues but this is the relationship that doesnt make me question myself.

It’s very different than my first love- that one was so fiery and intense and a constant rollercoaster. This one is strong and steady, I never question how he feels about me or doubt us.

Did you find a greater love after your first love broke your heart & how long after?,"I thought I loved a friend of mine that I met 16 years ago. He and I talked about everything and spent so much time together. He wasn't interested and I watched him get into a couple of relationships, one that ended in marriage, babies, the works. His wife did not like me (they started dating at 18/19, but she and I had known each other for about the same length of time so it went way back. We just left each other alone) so he abruptly ended our friendship when it got serious with her - completely ghosted. I didn't see it coming. I found myself even somewhat recently feeling betrayed and wondering what if, because I had never met anyone like him after that and he meant so much to me. I just kind of... waited, and didn't know if I would ever find someone that I could love again. A difficulty which was compounded over my teens and adult years do to sexual and physical abuse, PTSD, and a host of other complicating factors.

Then I met my now-boyfriend. He is more than I could have ever dreamed or hoped for, and I went into it giving him the least chance I've given anyone because I was so done. I even told him that I didn't know if I could even be in a relationship after everything I've been through, or that I could be a good partner. (To be clear, I am very attracted to him) He didn't go anywhere. He stayed one of my closest friends. He always supported me. He never took anything out on me. He was always patient, kind, understanding and honest. I needed to see that. I needed to get to know him as a friend and know that the man I knew who wanted to be with me was actually the man he appeared to be even when he couldn't have me. He knew all about my weaknesses and flaws before we got together. And he still chose me. I couldn't have imagined a man could be like this. He is both attentive and protective (but not in a jealous way). He nurtures me and supports me.

Did you find a greater love after your first love broke your heart & how long after?,"Absolutely. I found another love about two years after the heartbreak, and it was so much more in so many ways. It was beautiful and lifted me up in ways the first one never did.

Looking back, I can absolutely pinpoint which SOs were greater/deeper loves than others, and yet none of them hold a candle to the person I eventually married.  So it depends on how you count.  I started dating my now-husband a few weeks after I left my ex, who I loved very much and then deeply resented through the span of a years-long relationship, but if we count from the person that I consider my second-greatest love, it was more like 8 years.",31,dd2z8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/dd2z8i/did_you_find_a_greater_love_after_your_first_love/,34,1570195422.0,,2019-10-04 09:23:42

When was the last time your heart was broken? What did you do to heal?,"August 2017. It was a three year relationship that started in college. He was my first everything. Thought we were gonna get married and have kids. 

July 2018 was when I was able to sleep with another man (psychologically) 

January 2019 was when I was able to block my ex on all social media and try to purse a relationship with a man. (Bad timing didn’t pan out well)

August 2019 the dude from above and I found the right timing. And now I’m in a new relationship and hardly ever have my ex run though my head. 

I took my time for once.

"A platonic friend of the sex you're attracted to replies to your selfie with heart eye emojis and tells you that you're beautiful, despite knowing you're in a serious relationship. How do you respond?","I can't speak for how the other team plays the game, but at this point in my life (I'm older) I've come to realize that dudes never tell you that you're beautiful without an agenda, whether or not they admit it. And it's usually the dudes who are thirsty yet deathly afraid of rejection who make those types of comments to people already in relationships. 

I think it's because it gives them an emotional outlet, yet they never have to be worried about taking a rejection personally because hey, you're already taken so of course you're going to turn them down. It's not about them! Unless there's a blue moon chance you don't...in which case it's a win for their ego.

Basically, I say ""thanks"" and move on if it's occasional, but sometimes the behavior gets to be too much, and I can't help but feel that it's a little creepy and disrespectful of the relationship I'm actually in, especially if they know my SO. 

If it gets bad enough they get the talk. And I'm not falling for the backpedal insults like ""zomg I didn't mean it like that"" or ""zomg don't flatter yourself"" bullshit as if they wake up every day telling their own mother how hot she looks.

Why is it such a common theme in romance shows for a determined sweet lowly girl to melt the heart of a cold powerful guy?,"It's a power fantasy. A lot of young women like to fantasize about being so special to a guy that she becomes the catalyst for him to improve. It's the fantasy of a man listening to a woman asking him to improve, and then he actually does it. It gives the girl in the story a lot of power. Obviously it can be done poorly, but that's the core of the appeal as I understand it.

I used to deride it until it occurred to me that basically no one reads a romance book and then really truly believes that that's how relationships should be in real life. Young girls are smarter than we give them credit for, and they know the difference between fantasy and reality. I certainly did when I was a preteen fantasizing about a demon lord taking me away. 

No one was telling me to fantasize that stuff. I didn't do it because ""society raised me that way""...in fact I hid it from other people because I was embarrassed and thought I'd be made fun of for it. But it did make me feel powerful.

How do you feel about the person you thought you'd never get over?,"I had this one person I spent 3 years of my life thinking if he wasn't the person I'd be, than no one else would. I had such a firm believe that I'd never find someone else, that I could never fall for someone else because we were so perfect for each other.

Well, after a lot of hurt, I finally moved on. It took many cycles of breaking up and getting back together. No one could understand how I keep trying in this relationship that was clearly going nowhere. I eventually let go, and we spent 2 years full no contact. I eventually met other people in this time and saw that actually I had still plenty of options for my love life. We did reconnect 2 years after as friends, and I had changed so much, but he was just the same. And I could see how I got caught up in harmful dynamics and how unsuited to each other we were. We've been friends (not very close) for a year now and sometimes I just get the thought ""WTF was I thinking"" when I remember I was so so so so in love with him.

Today I think I never really liked how he treated me, or many of his personality traits, but I would just bush off or think ""if only he would change this bit"". I was in love with the potential, not with the reality. Also, I was in a very fragile emotional state, I was lonely and really confused about my life, so I used him as resource of happiness, and this rarely works in relationship.

I guess the key point in this kind of situation is to realize that how someone treats us, how much space they allocate for us in their lives, and how much they are willing to commit is a part of them, and a part of them we don't like. So they are not actually perfect for us.",10,i8jjhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/i8jjhi/how_do_you_feel_about_the_person_you_thought_youd/,43,1597286820.0,,2020-08-12 22:47:00

Backstory: She's a carpenter in Germany and in Germany, you have to build something for a final project so that she could officially finish her carpentry training. She built a beautiful desk with beautiful oak wood.

Fast forward a few years, and she had to move flats. She was moving in with her best friend and her best friend's boyfriend and they recruited some friends to help during the move. She informed everyone that her and I would be moving her desk as the desk is special to her. Someone during the move decided to go against her wishes and started moving the legs of her desk (she separated the legs so that it would be easier to move). The guy who was carrying the legs jammed it quite hard against the stairs causing it to crack. 

Once she set the main part of the desk onto the legs, she saw that the legs were cracked and started to cry as she could feel the legs were now wobbly from the crack. As she was crying, she accidentally dropped the main part of the desk, causing some dents as well. 

Then the tears were just waterfalls at that point and my heart broke for her and in that moment, I wanted to crush that dude's face/buy her all the oak in the world (not environment friendly I know but my heart felt like a volcanic eruption at the time - but not that it would've made a difference since every piece of any kind of wood will look differently anyway)/and just take away her pain/blaming myself for not having taken the legs first before the guy could. I couldn't stop crying for her either because I knew how much she worked for it and how beautiful the desk is. 

She has recovered from this and plans to fix it again one day when she is back in the carpentry and during COVID, she lets me use it when I work from home at her place which I find to be such an honor.",6,igsm0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/igsm0l/those_who_have_seen_their_significant_other_cry/,26,1598446382.0,,2020-08-26 08:53:02
"Those who have seen their significant other cry, how did it make you feel?","My boyfriend cried last night and, if I’m being completely honest, it was really frustrating. I’ll even say I was a little angry about it. 

We’ve been together for *four* years, living together for over two, and he still bottles things up and never communicates with me about anything, really. 

Whether he’s stressed about work or family. Not feeling well physically. Has concerns about our something going on in our relationship. He’ll wait until it bubbles over and then it all comes rushing out at once. And this usually happens when I initiate a serious conversation to communicate my own concerns. Then he kinda just hijacks the conversation and makes it about himself. 

Last night, I brought up marriage. When we moved in with each other, I told him that I saw it as a step towards marriage and was only comfortable moving in together if he did too. He agreed. Then a full year went by with no talk of marriage at all. Then another year. He never brings it up, never communicates that he’s thinking about marriage or if he even wants to get married. Nothing. So I bring it up last night and, after a few minutes, he starts crying almost hysterically about how he’s been so stressed at work. Fair disclosure, his job sucks. I would be stressed like crazy, too. BUT I received a pretty sizable raise a year ago and told him to find a new job/career, even if it means taking a pay cut, because I can hold us over for a while. I told him that *now* was the time to take a risk like that, because we don’t have kids to worry about. I told him to not wait another 10 miserable years and the really be stuck in a job he hates. 

Did he even consider what I said? Nope. Didn’t even brush up his resume. Didn’t search any job boards. He has a college degree, experience, a reliable car, and good health. He can do *anything* he puts his mind to. And he did nothing. 

So I didn’t really feel bad at all. And I was angry that he hijacked a conversation about marriage and made it about his shitty job that he’s done NOTHING about. 🤷🏼‍♀️",6,igsm0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/igsm0l/those_who_have_seen_their_significant_other_cry/,26,1598446382.0,,2020-08-26 08:53:02

But also if he's upset and his eyes so much as water it absolutely breaks my heart because he's not a crier so when something is bad enough for him to cry it absolutely wrecks me.,6,igsm0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/igsm0l/those_who_have_seen_their_significant_other_cry/,26,1598446382.0,,2020-08-26 08:53:02
"Those who have seen their significant other cry, how did it make you feel?","My boyfriend doesn’t cry often despite having many reasons to.

When I see him start to cry it instantly makes me cry and all I care about is supporting him and trying to make him happy. I fully support him crying and expressing himself- but it instantly triggers something in me and I instantly go to comfort him. All I feel is love for him and it breaks my heart.

"Those who have seen their significant other cry, how did it make you feel?","Like comforting them in most cases. Usually, crying is entirely human and emotionally healthy.

We have pet mice that he is very attached to and he insists on being the one to put them down when it’s time. 3/4 times I’ve seen him cry have been because of that. I always feel awkward because the solution is just to have me do it, because I’m weirdly not bothered by death in general. So I guess I feel sad and also helpless because I know the solution to make him less sad, but he doesn’t want to do it.

It was the first time I ever saw him cry. We had been married a couple of years or so and we sat down to watch the notebook.

At the end with the journal and everything, he just broke down. I mean completely broke. He sat with his head on my lap for a good 20 minutes. I was so touched due to the content and that this was his fear for us, but at the same time, having never seen him cry, I did not really know what to do. So I held him and told him everything would be ok.

Basically his sister revealed a childhood trauma that he didn't know about but rather than comforting each other, it was turned into her making it like ""my life is worse than yours because..."" 

Turns out my husband also shared a similar experience. We'd spoken of it once before in our relationship, I'd never pressed for details. I knew he'd share when and if he was ever ready to. He came to my house and we stood outside by his car and we hugged while he cried.

I felt horrible. I don't know what it's like to deal with that, I had only ever heard of it from people I didn't know all that well, so I never knew how to help someone else, all I knew was I wanted to be there for him to cry to if he needed someone.

Have you ever had a panic attack? How did/do you deal with it?,"Yes, use deep breathing techniques. Slowly breathe in for 5 seconds through your stomach, hold your breath for 5 seconds, breathe out for 5 seconds, rest for 5 seconds. Breathing in through your stomach and not your chest is important because chest breathing is how you breathe when you're active, not at rest, and you want to calm your body down. Slow breathing is also important because quick breathing leads to hyperventilation which horribly exacerbates panic attacks.",2,ijr0ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/ijr0ks/have_you_ever_had_a_panic_attack_how_diddo_you/,33,1598874803.0,Are there any useful tricks to make it less worse?,2020-08-31 07:53:23

Being aware of how it feels helps when I’m experiencing it because I know like oh if my heart rate is really fast and I feel like I can’t breathe, that’s just caused by this specific thing. Taking deep breaths and blowing out slowly, repeatedly, helps to reverse that bodily response. Listening to calming music helps as well, especially if you always play one thing when you feel that way it will come to help you calm down even quicker because your body associates it with being calm.

Have you ever had a panic attack? How did/do you deal with it?,"I had a really interesting session with a CBT therapist who went though every physical symptom of a panic attack that I experienced and explained biologically why my body was causing this to happen. It really helped to ground me because I realised my body is trying to help me rather than fight me and I think back to that conversation whenever I feel a panic attack coming on. He also told me that it can be useful to try and ask your body to do the opposite of what you want. For instance, when I have a panic attack my heart rate increases dramatically. He suggested rather than me thinking I need to slow my heart rate down (which tends to just make it beat even faster because I’m freaking myself out about why it’s so quick) to instead think “Go on then, speed up. Show me how fast you can go.” Incredibly, my heart rate then starts to decrease, because I’m not causing myself further panic about the physical aspects of the attack. It‘s obviously not going to work for everyone but this has really helped me so I’d advise looking into the physical manifestations of panic and seeing if it helps you to rationalise what your body is doing.",2,ijr0ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/ijr0ks/have_you_ever_had_a_panic_attack_how_diddo_you/,33,1598874803.0,Are there any useful tricks to make it less worse?,2020-08-31 07:53:23

How do you cope with health anxiety?,"My partner has health anxiety about his heart. Persistent fear of having heart attacks or heart problems. He is in a rough place with it right now, and as someone that's been on the sidelines of it for 7 years I really empathise with you OP. It's hard, and I'm sorry you're going through this. It's not your fault, you're not crazy, and you're not alone. What has worked the best for my partner in the past (and what I'm hoping he will take up again) is:

\- Antidepressants: He is on them now, but I think they only help to an extent, and the rest of it is the following points that are completely necessary.

\-  Therapy: This is a big one. Even though my partner only went for a few months and doesn't think it did much, I remember it waaay differently. He was much more accepting of the idea that what he had was a non-permanent mental disorder, not a permanent physical issue. This alone might not sound like much, but I think it had a genuinely enormous benefit. Also, therapists, especially if they have experience and expertise in treating health anxiety - they have a big old sack full of things that have helped people before you. Within that sack are things that will help you. (horrible metaphore Im sorry lol)

\- Exercise: When my partner was exercising every day, he was at his most functional. At first it was hard, and he would need to go home early because the sensations scared him, or wouldn't be able to go without a phone for fear he'd need an ambulance. But after a few weeks he was running not walking, and he was loving the feeling of exercise, he'd blast music, get into it, and feel good about having done it for the rest of the day. Plus - endorphins and mood benefits. I think it was also a bit of exposure to the fear, and proof that physical sensations don't = bad.

\- Going out and doing things: Whatever you like. He went golfing, went to restaurants, went bowling, went shopping, etc. The weeks where he went out and did enjoyable fun things were most often the weeks when he was the least anxious. And the opposite is true - the more isolated and inactive he is, the worse his mental health is.

\^ SImilar, being social when possible.",7,ijdilw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/ijdilw/how_do_you_cope_with_health_anxiety/,18,1598826498.0,,2020-08-30 18:28:18
How do you cope with health anxiety?,"I'm seeing a therapist who specializes in CBT. It's helpful.

How do you cope with health anxiety?,"Stay away from Google. Feeding the compulsion to Google your symptoms is only gonna make you more worried, even tho anxiety brain will try and tell you it's reassuring. It's not. 

One thing that helps me is writing out a plan. e.g. 'If this stomach pain gets worse, then I will call a nurse helpline', or 'If this symptom is still happening in two days, I will make a doctor's appointment.' I think getting it out of my head and onto paper helps a lot, as does realising that I can just wait and see what happens before panicking.",7,ijdilw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/ijdilw/how_do_you_cope_with_health_anxiety/,18,1598826498.0,,2020-08-30 18:28:18
How do you cope with health anxiety?,"One of the best pieces of advice that I've ever gotten about anxiety is to never act on an anxiety-disordered thought, because that reinforces it and makes it feel more justified.

Decide on the things that you are going to do to stay healthy when you are in a calm moment, do those things, and do not allow yourself to do anything else just because you're anxious. It really does make the anxiety fade over time.

For example, I have a lot of anxiety about money. So, I made some rules for grocery shopping --- I buy store brand where I can, buy things that are on sale if possible, and make a lot of things from scratch. Then, I made the decision that as long as I am following those rules, I have to order whatever I feel like eating from the grocery store and am not allowed to worry about it.

What’s a red flag that made you leave your partner in a heart beat?,"I didn’t leave him over this, but I was immediately concerned and proceeded very cautiously when he quit his job out of the blue with no backup plan.

But I was very concerned that this was a sign that he a) Gave up when things got hard and b) made irresponsible decisions. 

My gut reaction turned out to be right. Around 3 weeks after he quit his job, he decided there were no jobs for him in our area (we live in a huge metropolitan area with a booming job market), so he was going to look out of state. He also decided he needed to end things (even though it could have been months before he actually moved) unless I was willing to follow him wherever he might end up. I said ✌️ out and never saw him again. But I know via Instagram that he actually did leave the state shortly after that 🤷‍♀️ As my dad said later, there’s a reason he job hopped so much.

How soon after having your heart broken did you feel ready to date again?,"I broke up with my ex boyfriend in late June 2018. The beginning of September, I met my current boyfriend. Late October we started dating, so about a month 1/2 later. 

I was with my ex boyfriend for nearly a year, unofficially for about a year. So altogether nearly 2 years. I was 16 when we broke up. We initially broke up bc of arguing, but it turns out he cheated on me anyway because I didn’t want to have sex with him yet (he ended up pestering me for months). 

I was quite better by August, but by god after we broke up I was an absolute mess. I lost like a stone in a week because I couldn’t eat. 

I suppose I was able to move on so fast because I knew I didn’t want him back, once it sunk in that he cheated on me. I was worried just before I started dating my current boyfriend in case it was too soon, but I ended up being perfectly fine. 

We’ve been together two years this October, I’m 19 now. We couldn’t be better.",5,crlrkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/crlrkv/how_soon_after_having_your_heart_broken_did_you/,15,1566075144.0,,2019-08-17 16:52:24

How soon after having your heart broken did you feel ready to date again?,"Maybe 3 business days lmao. Honestly though, now that I think about it, every guy who has severely broken my heart, that time in my life overlapped a time when I met someone new to start crushing on. In other words I got heartbroken and very soon after that while I was still hurt I met someone else who I grew to like. I got over the heartbreak completely when I found someone new to focus on.

Sleep as much as you can. Exercise, and eat what you want. Be around people- I found that being alone is when I’d obsess and think about what went wrong. Change is always good, for example he never wanted me to dye my hair. So I made an appointment to get my hair done. It felt great! I went clothes shopping for things that made me feel pretty. I planned trips so I’d have something to look forward to. I put more effort into my job and career and got promoted. 

Instead of thinking I wasn’t good enough or desirable enough, I started saying words of affirmation to myself that other people were saying to me so I’d start believing it. I read somewhere that instead of remembering only the good times and their good qualities, remember their flaws and bad behaviors to have a more realistic memory of them.

Also, working out can help a ton, too. Self help books can be awesome and are cheaper than therapy if that's not an option. Also, as much as people hate to hear it: time. Time will heal, especially if used well. Don't do what I did for months and replay in your head everything that you or them said or did.

What is the best remedy for a broken heart?,"1. Time. EVERYONE says it, but it's just true. No, you probably won't be feeling that great within a week, or a month, or maybe even a couple months if it was a serious, all-consuming relationship. But, life goes on, and you wouldn't believe how both your perspective will change and your emotions will settle within a few months.
2. Write it out. I'm fond of opening up a Word document and just typing my feelings out. For this to be successful, you should put your all into it, and allow yourself to feel all of those shitty emotions. It's painful, and it makes you cry and feel awful, but it's very cathartic. Maybe you'll even look back on your writing in the near future and laugh, who knows.
3. Distract yourself with good things. See friends and family more, and truly be in the moment and enjoy your time with those supportive people in your life. Some people distract themselves by immediately talking to new guys or girls, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but trying to get romantically involved with someone new right away has usually made me feel worse in the long run by covering up emotional wounds.
4. Reconnect with the parts of yourself that made you happy before you were even in a relationship with this person. For me, this is usually two-fold. First, this allows me to recognize that there are things that make me happy that AREN'T connected to an ex, and second, it reminds me that I was a happy and perfectly fine human being before I was with an ex, which means I'll be back on track to being in that headspace again.",63,9ax37p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/9ax37p/what_is_the_best_remedy_for_a_broken_heart/,81,1535472842.0,&#x200B;,2018-08-28 12:14:02

What secret warms your cold little heart?,"Some indie shitheads promised me if I wrote a script, they'd make it into a short film series.

Wrote several episodes, spent countless hours going over characters and plot threads and moulding this awesome world. They were with me every step of the way, encouraged me, were decent soundboards as I launched ideas at them, pointed me toward screenwriting books for advice. 

Four months into the project - indie guys had even done actor interviews, and decided on the main cast, and we had done a small fundraiser to get some better lighting equipment.... 

They dropped me from the group. 

Decided their writer buddy would take over as the main writer and I'd be dropped from the project, and set as a co-writer for the first episodes I WROTE ON MY GODDAMN OWN. They kicked me out of the facebook chat, the group, and I stopped receiving texts after the one FACEBOOK message that I was being dropped for no fucking reason.  They planned to continue the project with my work and give me shit credit. 

Nu-uh, that shit would not fly. 

So, I went into the site we'd been hosting the script I WROTE, THANK YOU, and copied it all into my personal google docs. Deleted everything. They have *nothing* of mine. Their project ground to a halt and they only puttered around for a few more days before dropping off the face of the planet.

When did you push a doctor who didn’t believe you?,"I've had terrible anxiety and stress when I was 15-16 and my abdomen started hurting so much, I would have trouble keeping down what I eat. The pain got so bad, I would even throw up after drinking water. I was already anemic and underweight but those symptoms made that matter even worse.

My doctor told me the pain and nausea is caused by my stress and was ""just in my head."" It's only after I found blood when throwing up that they figured it might be a physical issue after all.

Lo and behold, they found out - after a few days at the hospital and an endoscopy - that I had a bleeding stomach ulcer which is why ingesting anything would bring so much physical pain and discomfort.

Around 25 she started regularly having episodes of severe heart arrhythmias. So bad she fainted and seriously thought she would die (and once almost did because it happened while she was driving). Every doctor she saw told her she was just having panic attacks or was hysterically imagining things and that is wasn\`t as bad as she made it out to be, because by the time she reached the doctor the attack was over and she didn't show any signs of a heart attack in the EKGs. It took more than a dozen cardiologists and over 20 years of visiting doctors for one to finally believe her. She has Wolff-Parkinson-White-Syndrom in combination with a  disorder causing the blood to clot faster and form miniscule clots that reach the heart and trigger an attack but disolve later and can't be detected.

When did you push a doctor who didn’t believe you?,"I always had gynecological problems because of a failed surgery when i was child. Since then i had one surgery because of cysts and other stuff exactly because of that surgery. Back then, my doctor told me to be prepared for another surgery in few years, most probably when i will be 18. And there it was. The pain got back when i hit 18 and i knew it was time. I told my gynecologist that i need a surgery. She asked me why so i told her to check me. She found NOTHING. No cysts, nothing. So I believed her and i was happy like yay maybe its really over. She got me on some medication to prevent such things to even happen and sent me home.
Month later. I had to call an ambulance. Blood was rushing out of me and pain hit me like crazy. It was not my time of the month and it sure never hurt like that. Five doctors had to look at me to be sure that what they see on my sonos are cysts. There were two of them. They told me I could go on with some medication to get them smaller. I said F**K NO. I ve been in this situation on my first surgery and I knew it would not work. I immediately called my doctor to get me the f**king surgery. She did. 
Day before surgery. The head of the hospital that was supposed to do the surgery called for me and gave me a speech about risks im taking by having surgery only because of cysts. In pain that lasted for over a year i said DO IT.
Few hours after surgery. I woke up. It was like 3pm. I immediately screamed because of the pain and they had to put me to sleep again. I woke up 5pm. I got worried because the told me i would be up atleast at 1pm. Until the late evening i did not know what happened. Then the doctors show up to tell all the patients results of the surgery. Everyone except me. An hour later my doctor show up walking to me like on a funeral. What he told me? My left fallopian had rotten. Literally. Because of the first f**ked up surgery and because of a bad recovery from the second one. Also he told me they had to take care of other stuff and ofcourse the cysts because they looked really bad when the saw them from inside. And also that he is very sorry that he underestimated me.
Half a year later im recovered. Not fully, that will never be obviously but im happy its over and that the worst is behind me.

I continued to have pain for the next year or so, after every time I ate, including anything actually healthy. I finally did a consultation with a surgeon my (nurse) uncle recommended and he at least gave me the option after seeing my paperwork. He explained that the surgery may not fix the issue entirely, but in cases like mine, it usually at least provides some amount of relief.

What's the most selfless thing a partner has done for you?,Work full time so I can go to school full time and get my degree. He's given me a loving home and supports me and our cats fully. He sacrifices so much for me to pursue my dream.,273,f483el,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/f483el/whats_the_most_selfless_thing_a_partner_has_done/,111,1581794027.0,,2020-02-15 14:13:47
What's the most selfless thing a partner has done for you?,"Oh boy, it's a long one TLDR at the end.

My boyfriend (33) had congestive heart failure (diagnosed June 19). He had previously bought an engagement ring but it hadn't arrived yet, thus ruining several plans he'd made for a proposal. After his diagnosis we decided to postpone proposing until he felt better. He really struggled with depression as he got progressively worse and I wanted him to recover and not feel any pressure. Whenever he was ready was fine with me and I repeatedly told him he didn't need to makes big deal of it. I did want his head and heart to be in the right place though.

On December 9th he had a cardiac arrest and died for like 5+ minutes while we were alone and out of state. I was able to call 911 and do chest compressions until paramedics arrived. They were able to restore his heart beat and breathing eventually (it stopped again at one point so his total dead time is almost 8-10 it was just 5 minutes with me) but he didn't weak up for well over three hours. I'm not sure how long exactly because I was a wreck. 

When I was finally able to see him he still wasn't awake. They sent a minister in to keep me company. She asked about it wedding and I admitted of said I was his fiance too make sure I could come back and explain or situation. I made a self disappearing joke and I felt him twitch and squeeze my hand (he'd been jerking/twitching now and again and crying a bit) the minister saw him actually move in what looked like a reaction to what I said. 

So she says ""Sunbear's boyfriend you've got to wake up, you haven't married her yet and she hasn't figured it where you hid the ring!"" 

I was like OMG no he doesn't need that pressure! So I said ""Sweetie just hang in there and come back to me and I'll live in sin with you forever if you want!"" He very clearly nods his head ""no"" and grips my hand really firmly. 

The minister runs out of the room for a nurse while I babble at him and his eyes open. He looks straight at me from this point on. The doctors and nurses come in and he responds to their requests wiggling toes and lifting his arms. He puts his hand on my face as they quickly decide to sedate him because he's so weak. He's got a breathing tube in but managed to kind of mouth ""love you."" At this point I am terrified he will die.

Fast forward almost a month. He was unconscious for  almost two weeks total with a balloon pump in and out and put back in again after being flown home to Mayo clinic from NC. He's not responding to medicine and he's going to have to stay in the hospital until he gets a heart transplant. They move from a balloon pump in his leg to one in his chest. Now he can stand. He's got an SvO2 of 23. 

He kept sending me away to do stuff on the 30th and the 31stv which was unlike him but I could tell he was tired and assumed he wanted to rest. In reality he was planning and prescribing a proposal. Every time I left he called in nurses or PT to have them help figure out how to kneel. One nurse told me later he's describe all the things he'd wanted to to and how his plans kept getting small as he got sicker. Now he just wanted to put on pants and kneel when he asked. 

So he did and it was the most amazing feat of strength and effort I've ever seen, although he made it look easy. 

Unfortunately, with so little oxygen his condition deteriorated overnight and he had to be put on and ECMO machine which is a heart and long bipass machine. He wasn't able to be awake after that until 4 days after he got his new heart. He's recovering slowly and we're getting married March 14th because ""it's ridiculous that I haven't married you yet."" He'll probably be in impatient rehab my then.

TLDR: fiance put a huge effort into kneeling when he proposed even though he was basically dying because his heart no longer worked. He's getting better after transplant.",273,f483el,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/f483el/whats_the_most_selfless_thing_a_partner_has_done/,111,1581794027.0,,2020-02-15 14:13:47

What's the most selfless thing a partner has done for you?,"Within the first year we dated, I had gotten sick with a bad cold about a month before Christmas. There is a massive teacher shortage in my district, and I'm the music teacher. There were no subs available so I kept dragging myself into work as I was pressured to prepare for the Christmas concert, and each time I went in I would get pulled to cover a classroom teacher's absence making me even more stressed that I dragged myself in sick only to be told to cover for another sick teacher and get even more stressed about missing out on more Christmas concert practices, and kept coming in to try and make them up to only get pulled again. It was the most vicious cycle.

The last day of school before Xmas break, my van's engine essentially had a minor blow up and fell to pieces on the highway. On the coldest day of the year.

So I was so sick, freezing my ass off, with no vehicle. My boyfriend, still new at the time, rallied his family to come rescue me because no tow trucks were available (he was inebriated at a work Xmas party so he couldn't drive to get me, not his fault), brought me to his home where I stayed the whole 2 weeks. He took me to the hospital and clinics several times (where they found I had severely pulled the muscles in my ribcage, as a result of continually forcing myself to sing at work and constantly coughing), he looked after me. Oh yeah. He also got a new engine and totally rebuilt my van in that 2 week Xmas break. 

I would have been so, so lost without everything he did. I had never experienced a partner so selfless like that.

What's the most selfless thing a partner has done for you?,I became pregnant with our third child in February 2019. We were already planning to move to a new state to be closer to his job. He told me that I didn't have to work and could stay home with the kids if I wanted to. I've consistently worked since I was 16 (was 27 at the time) and felt uncomfortable with him shouldering all the financial burden.

What's the most selfless thing a partner has done for you?,"My husband is an incredible cook.

I remember a while back my mom was talking about this dish she had as a kid and how much she wished she could eat it again. She grew up in a small third world country and this was some obscure local cultural food. She couldn't even remember the name. He asked her a few questions about the dish, what it tasted like, what the ingredients were. And the next weekend he made it. And here's the thing, my mom forgot there was a sauce and told him there was no sauce. But he was able to intuit there was a sauce and even what kind of sauce it was. And he nailed it. It was exactly what my mom remembered and grandma confirmed it.

That is how great of a cook he is. He never uses a recipe, never measures. He just knows what to do. I always tell him he should quit his job and open a restaurant.

Anyway when we were first dating my dad had cancer. It was bad and looked like we were going to lose him for a while. One of the side effects of the treatment was he completely lost his appetite. We tried feeding him everything but he wouldn't eat it or he'd just peck at it. And it seemed like it was effecting him, he was depressed and didn't have any strength.

Then my now husband came over to meet the family and made dinner for all of us. And my dad loved it. Had two plates. So he'd come over and make these elaborate dinners literally every night. Cooking for at least an hour each time. After a ten hour shift. I can count on one hand the days he missed. All so my dad would eat. 

I really can't help but credit that with my dads recovery. His mood increased, he was actually eating and getting strength. It was like night and day.

That's how good of a man my husband is. Doing that for someone who he had been dating for barely  a months dad.",273,f483el,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/f483el/whats_the_most_selfless_thing_a_partner_has_done/,111,1581794027.0,,2020-02-15 14:13:47

What's the most selfless thing a partner has done for you?,"I have always struggled with my mental health (depression, anxiety, social anxiety, body dysmorphic disorder). A month after my husband and I got married, shit hit the fan for me. I hadn't been to therapy in a while and my antidepressant that I was on for 7 years just wasn't working for me anymore. I had a breakdown at work a week or so before our wedding, and wasn't working for weeks when I had to check myself into an inpatient behavioral health facility. I just wasn't taking care of myself (not showering, not feeding myself) and I was having some seriously dark thoughts about myself (wishing I wouldn't wake up, hating everything about myself). I was there for a week and had a traumatic experience. 

While I went to therapy and tried all sorts of medications (I lost my mind for a bit), my husband was patient and took care of me while i didn't work. I'm almost all the way better now; I'm taking care of myself and almost ready to go back to work after almost 2 years. I never thought that anyone would stick by my side, let alone take care of me, while going through something like this.

What's the most selfless thing a partner has done for you?,"I will start with this moment I will never forget.

My boyfriend forced me to go to ER when I had my first bad UTI with blood and all (I was a foreign student, so I was afraid of how expensive it'd be), we were just dating for a month or so at that time. He quickly pulled his card out to pay first as I was contacting my family, didn't flinch at the sight of my bloody urine in the cup, accompanied me when I was stuck on a wheelchair to finish 2 bags of IV drips (since I couldn't even fill the cup), lent me his phone cuz mine died, pushed my wheelchair around in case I got bored, and spoonfed some tofu pudding for me even though actually I could use my right hand. 

After we are done with that, I accidentally left my phone in the toilet and lost it, and went nuts. He stayed with me as I went through small version of 7 stages of grief. Next few days, he took leaves or worked from home so that he could visit me and stayed with me the whole day. He also helped me to trace it and accompanied me to take my phone back from the guy who found it. 

Some might think he did that because we were just started dating, but well, he stays with me until now. At this point he has seen all of my best and worst side; which for me, is another selfless thing, to accept someone even though she can be a crazy moody lion sometimes.",273,f483el,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/f483el/whats_the_most_selfless_thing_a_partner_has_done/,111,1581794027.0,,2020-02-15 14:13:47

We got into the restaurant and at the register, he looked at me and asked, ""Would you rather have chicken nuggets instead of the sandwiches?""

My brain did incorrect math and somehow decided that a $6 20pc nugget was the same price as 3 sandwiches, so I said yes. He looked over to the cashier and just got nuggets and a drink, and then I realized *he didn't get food so that I could get chicken nuggets.*

"If you had to eat a human, how would you cook him?","I'd imagine you'd need to remove the entrails carefully before the meat spoils much like a deer or similar animal , and toss out the brain cause that can have prion diseases. No need to take chances. Nothing in the skull is worth eating anyway really. Toss the kidneys too, not worth it for nutrional value. Then remove legs and arms and cook the torso like on a spit roast or in the oven (legs and arms would dangle too much/too unwieldy and heavy). The rest can be made into steak, chuck, and ground meat depending on the quality. You can of course save the leftovers and make sausage with the cleaned entrails, but that may be risky given what's in our gut. Toss the genitals unless you want to try an adpatation of rocky mountain oysters. 

If your going for pure nutrional value, i.e. starving on a mountain, bone marrow is pretty much number one, with other sources of fat like the buttocks, then thighs and torso. The arms and legs are more lean meat. Blood, of all things, has a lot of salt so you would need water as well, but contains a ton of iron. A heart is pretty thick meat, but I've had chunks of beef heart on a kebab and it was pretty good.

What is the best way to end a serious relationship in order to spare the other person's feelings and make them understand why you are doing it?,"There really isn't a ""best"" way because, no matter what, if someone's getting their heart broken, they're gonna hurt. You can't ""spare"" a person's feelings; you shouldn't intend to control how someone feels, anyways. This is one of those life events that just suck no matter how you phrase it.

I would say the *most responsible* way to approach a breakup would be after genuinely trying to make it work. Generally, you shouldn't be blindsiding anyone with information about the relationship you haven't shared before. There are exceptions of course, abuse being one of them, but in general the person should be aware of the reason for the breakup before the actual breakup conversation. 

They might never understand; that's also okay. If you say your piece and they're still reeling, give them time to process before inundating them with excess information. At a certain point it isn't necessary for the broken-up-with partner to agree with your perception of the relationship, because it takes two to tango in that regard and they will probably always perceive the breakup in a different way than you.",9,ht94jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/ht94jo/what_is_the_best_way_to_end_a_serious/,9,1595068451.0,,2020-07-18 06:34:11

Ending a serious relationship will hurt, there’s nothing else to it. The best way is honestly and as kindly as possible, and not dragging it out. Once it‘s done, don’t  promise to be friends. Leave, and cut contact. It might seem harsh, but if you don’t, the other person will keep trying to contact you, for ‘answers’ ‘closure’ or whatever, when really seeking reconciliation. What both parties need is space to move on, and you can’t do that if you keep in touch. But you must make sure you say everything you need to say and not leave them wondering- which is why honesty is the best policy.",9,ht94jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/ht94jo/what_is_the_best_way_to_end_a_serious/,9,1595068451.0,,2020-07-18 06:34:11

What is your most memorable story/experience with another person that you did not share a common language with?,"A few years ago, I did the Shikoku Pilgrimage in Japan. Shikoku is a fairly rural island so there isn't much spoken English, and my Japanese is extremely limited. I would regularly have to try to communicate with people in basic, broken Japanese if they did not speak any English (which was common).

I was always surprised by the warmth and kindness shown to me by others despite the language barrier. One elderly pilgrim was bent over almost 90 degrees and made sure I was ok that day, even trying to offer me a part of his lunch when he saw I didn't have much to eat. One man and I shared candy and had fun comparing flavours. There was one point where I had to take a detour due to construction and a couple of locals (one lady walking her dog, another out for a jog) tried to explain to me an alternate route. The jogger went with me to ensure I didn't get lost because I didn't completely understand their directions. At one point, I injured my knee and ankle pretty badly and walked with a significant limp. I had so many locals and pilgrims worry about me, give me medicine, and make sure I was ok.

I had to speak in broken English and asked what language he spoke and he said Urdu. At that stage, I was not fluent in Urdu, I was still learning. However, my broken Urdu and his fluent Urdu allowed us to communicate well.

As soon as I began speaking in Urdu he was so happy. The smile on his face I can still remember, it was so genuine. I learned a little about his family and how he ended up in England.

What was the subject of your most benign/monotonous nightmare ever?,"This is a vivid reoccurring dream I have. It’s pretty boring but in the moment it drives me crazy. forgive the formatting, I’m on mobile.

I’m driving to work and there is traffic. I knew I was going to be late. No big deal. I reach for my phone I tossed in the passenger seat while keeping my eyes on the road. I go to call and at first I can’t open my phone. 

The traffic doesn’t move. 

I struggle with my phone and I know my fingers are pressing the buttons but I can’t feel them touch it. I feel a little bit of panic but i figured a quick look won't hurt.

I peek over to see that my phones been unlocked the whole time. Traffic stays stagnant.

I go to call my job but I can’t remember the number. Ok, that’s ok, i have it saved in contacts. How do i get to my contacts again? I know i /should/ know but can’t remember how for the life of me. I blindly press against the screen. I’m looking at my phone but I can’t see it at the same time. Somehow I’m acutely aware that traffic /still/ hasn’t moved.

My heart rates jumps at this point. I need to call work but I can’t remember why. I give up on trying to contact directly through my company’s number. I’ll try for one of my coworkers.

I can’t remember any of my coworkers.

My heart drops into my stomach. I can feel myself sweating but it’s not soaking through my clothes. I don’t remember what I’m wearing but I’m pretty sure it’s not my uniform. Shit did i forget to put on a bra this morning? I need to turn around but this traffic isn’t moving. I’m still in the same spot I started in and I’m not even sure if my cars on. When did I leave? Where’s the time? Did i ever find my phone? My panic gets worse.

The other cars are moving but I can only see through the rear view mirror. Somehow I still can’t move. I notice that the world is completely silent. 

I wake up abruptly, like I’ve fallen back into my body. My heart is pounding and I scramble to reach for my phone because I’m late for work. It’s 3 AM. I’m pissed",20,gp9wyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/gp9wyl/what_was_the_subject_of_your_most/,23,1590287278.0,,2020-05-23 22:27:58

How do you go about your “soul searching?”,"Getting outside of what you know.

For me, it’s really important when I feel uncomfortable with something to learn more about it rather than immediately reject it. And this tends to lead down a path of discovery that’s often surprising.

Also, leaving what you know to explore what else is out there. Travel is important, yes. Especially when you don’t speak the language and the culture is different form what you know. 

But also reading things that make you uncomfortable. Publications that proclaim beliefs I think I object to, following social media that makes me angry (and responding respectfully). Meeting people who are different from em and learning their stories.

The more you expose yourself to, the closer you get to your own “soul”.",15,gwvdo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/gwvdo9/how_do_you_go_about_your_soul_searching/,16,1591350971.0,Traveling? Hobbies?,2020-06-05 05:56:11

How do you go about your “soul searching?”,"My soul searching was and is Bible Reading and it has been searched out. This happened when I felt CONSISTENTLY desperate for Him that I left school and my job at the time and now only God Focus. 

The best decision I have made all my life in the midst of making the dumbest decisions and trying to figure out who I was. But now I can say everything has been put together: having my own family, a whole heart and not broken or empty, and all love having completed me and been put in my heart and mind.

Never to go back and depend/rely on someone for anything. But only be dependent on Him for all things and COMPLETE trust in Him to provide and protect in these dangerous times. 

Love To Everyone
Make Your Heart Complete With Him

Blessed [joyful, nourished by God’s goodness] are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness [those who actively seek right standing with God], for they will be [completely] satisfied.

"Ladies, what are the things that your SO do, that melts your heart?","Each morning I awaken with extremely painful hands. I can’t move them or use them at all for quite awhile. He rubs my hands and says, “oh, poor hands. They’re so poor.” He then pulls me up to a seated position on the bed and puts my robe on me backwards, so I can sit on the toilet and not be cold. 


Fills my mug with fresh ice water, puts my Bluetooth speaker and lunchbox in my backpack, and makes me a delicious breakfast shake. Puts all this in my car and starts it. Every single morning he walks me to my car and opens the door for me. Sometimes if I get a head start, he races in front of me. Then he and the dog sit on the porch and wave goodbye as I leave. The dog hops in his lap, and sits on his hind legs... boyfriend flaps the dogs paw to “wave” at me.

She had forgotten this certain train my sister wanted (a character from Thomas the Train, kinda uncommon in local stores) & asked if we would swing by Toys R Us to see if they had it. We searched for an hour but they didn’t have it. We were disappointed, but my stepmom said it was no big deal. 

A few months later, it was my sisters birthday. My boyfriend called the week before her party & said “hey! I got baby J a present.” I asked him what it was & he sent me a picture of the train she wanted.

It has been months but he still remembered what the trains name was & looked like. It seems silly, but wow I was amazed. Also seeing my sisters face when she opened it was amazing.

He tells me to go to bed when I've stayed up much later than I should. 

One of my nicknames for him is ""Oshy"". He will randomly come up to me when I'm sitting on the couch, start bouncing me around and yelling ""Oshy Quake!""

When our kids are being terrors and not listening to me, he steps in and disciplines them. He works while I stay at home, so 95% of the time I deal with discipline while he is the fun daddy (perfectly fine by me, it changed when he stayed home and I worked). It's amazing knowing that he will always have my back, and knows exactly when I need him to step in. 

He encourages me to make friends, and have kid free time with them. 

I often sleep without blankets on. He has to have it cold to fall asleep, so he always turns the a.c. low right before he comes to bed in the morning.

She said she felt out of breath, and like her arms had just turned to lead. I wanted to call 911 but she was ADAMANT that she was fine. 

Fast forward a few weeks, she's been exhausted. She's missed so much work because she's ready to nap by 2pm, and needs to go home. She hasn't felt heavy and leaden since that night, but her chest and back felt really tight. After 3 weeks of feeling like this, she finally went to a hospital. Turns out she had a ""serious cardiac event"" and needed a stent put in. She was hospitalized for about a week. 

She said it never felt painful or sharp, and it didn't feel sudden like in movies. One day she was able to run up a flight of stairs and cook dinner, and the next day she needed to nap by 2pm and couldn't handle walking for 10 minutes without a rest.

"for those who have had a heart attack, what was the experience like?","I haven't had a heart attack, but since these stories are being shared I wanted to note the difference between cardiac arrest and a heart attack. My father had a heart attack without going into arrest and somehow this wasn't communicated to my brother or me so we didn't fully grasp what was happening, and I've since heard many people dismiss their symptoms because they don't match a movie scenario.

Below is an abbreviated version from the [American Heart Association](http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks/heart-attack-or-sudden-cardiac-arrest-how-are-they-different), but they have the full signs and symptoms of a heart attack or stroke on their website. As well as info on Hands-Only CPR. Hopefully okay to share here.

""People often use these terms interchangeably, but they are not synonyms. A heart attack is when blood flow to the heart is blocked, and sudden cardiac arrest is when the heart malfunctions and suddenly stops beating unexpectedly. A heart attack is a “circulation” problem and sudden cardiac arrest is an “electrical” problem.
 
Symptoms of a heart attack may be immediate and intense. More often, though, symptoms start slowly and persist for hours, days or weeks before a heart attack. Unlike with sudden cardiac arrest, the heart usually does not stop beating during a heart attack. The heart attack symptoms in women can be different than men.

Sudden cardiac arrest occurs suddenly and often without warning. It is triggered by an electrical malfunction in the heart that causes an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). With its pumping action disrupted, the heart cannot pump blood to the brain, lungs and other organs. Seconds later, a person loses consciousness and has no pulse. Death occurs within minutes if the victim does not receive treatment.""

"for those who have had a heart attack, what was the experience like?",I don't know. I found out that I had already had one when I went to the cardiologist for some tests. ,65,9tdzct,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/9tdzct/for_those_who_have_had_a_heart_attack_what_was/,14,1541138421.0,,2018-11-02 02:00:21
"for those who have had a heart attack, what was the experience like?","I have not had a heart attack but I am a nurse who works in a hospital unit that deals with them on a regular basis :)

Just for clarification, as another Redditor pointed out, a ""heart attack"" is a term commonly applied to two different scenarios: a blockage in a coronary artery that causes heart muscle damage (myocardial infarction) OR when the heart isn't pumping blood properly and essentially stops (cardiac arrest), causing a person to essentially die unless someone helps (I.e. CPR +/- defibrillation). However, the two aren't necessarily exclusive - a myocardial infarction *can* cause a cardiac arrest if left untreated (though cardiac arrests aren't always caused by myocardial infarctions, and there are different types of cardiac arrests.....yeah, it's complicated lol).

So for this post, I'm going to assume ""heart attack"" to mean myocardial infarction, which is more common but harder to diagnose (because let's be real, if you go into cardiac arrest, you die, and that's not hard to miss).

The classic symptoms of a myocardial infarction are:

* Chest pain or pressure (often described as squeezing, like a band over the chest, or ""like an elephant sitting on the chest"")
* Pain radiating to the left arm and/or jaw
* Shortness of breath
* Nausea +/- vomiting
* Sweating
* Just generally feeling that something is very wrong

However, I've also seen lots of people say they had vague symptoms.

Most common of the subtle symptoms is the feeling of indigestion or heartburn. I can't count the amount of times I've heard the story of ""ate a big meal, went to bed, woke up with indigestion, took an antacid, and still felt like shit, continued to take antacids, and when I felt really unwell, went to the hospital."" The general rule of thumb I like to stick to is, if you're having heartburn and it won't go away with heartburn treatment, see a doctor. Even if it's ""just"" heartburn, you'll want to get it treated, anyway, because if left uncontrolled, it can damage your esophagus.

Other vague symptoms would be things like back pain, arm pain, nausea, intense fatigue, and dizziness. In fact, a couple of times, I've had patients who had no symptoms at all until we ran some tests on them; this is most common in people with diabetes.

While women are more likely to have the non-traditional signs and symptoms, men can have them, too, just like women can also have the classic signs. In fact, my first patient with a silent heart attack (no signs or symptoms) was a man!

So yeah, it's not very cut and dry but if you are ever concerned, please just call 911 (or whatever number you call for an ambulance) and get yourself to a hospital. Even if it turns out to be nothing, don't feel embarrassed or feel like you've wasted our time. We always take potential cardiac symptoms seriously because it's hard for us to tell, too, based on signs and symptoms alone, and the tests are fairly easy and quick. And  like a lot of other major ailments, it's best to get treated early rather than let it go on and on, potentially causing major damage.

Lastly, because I always get messaged, *please* no one ask me medical questions about you or a specific person. I cannot make assessments and give advice over the internet. If you have concerns about yourself or a loved one, please see a doctor in person.",65,9tdzct,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/9tdzct/for_those_who_have_had_a_heart_attack_what_was/,14,1541138421.0,,2018-11-02 02:00:21
"for those who have had a heart attack, what was the experience like?","My mom had one last year and said it wasn't what men are known to experience at all. She had gone to bed and felt uneasy, said her heart started to ""smash and bang"" and generally felt anxious and unwell. She said she just knew something was wrong and suspected a heart attack, as they run in the family (she was the fourth of her siblings to have one within a three-year span) and my grandmother had died of one when I was a baby. My dad drove her to the hospital and it was confirmed she had a ""mild, non-stemi"" heart attack. Heart disease seems to be hitting the family younger and younger so my brother and I are probably at risk of developing it too.

"Women whose heart has been broken by a guy, how’d you describe the feeling?","Honestly, to me it feels like hearing of someone's death.

In a way it makes sense, when my heart has been broken it's been a sudden shock - one who cheated with my flatmate, one I thought loved me but dumped me for saying he'd hurt me - it's like losing a loved one to death, suddenly the person you loved is gone forever.

This quote is from Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, a strange source but I like how it explains the death of a loved one, and this is exactly how heartbreak has felt for me. It's a sudden deep dark hole opening inside you that you have to somehow find a way to heal.

What is something your SO has done that absolutely broke your heart?,"We've been together since 2002. He knows my birthday means a lot to me. I don't ask for extravagant things or dinner at some 5 star restaurant. This year he, and our children (who are younger than 12) didn't do anything. I thought they were pulling my leg. Nope. I didn't even get a card. If I hadn't said it was my birthday they wouldn't have even wished me a happy birthday. He took me out for breakfast because we hadn't eaten, so it was just another day.

It sounds stupid. But it hurt more than anything over the last 14 years with him. ",191,5jg5ty,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/5jg5ty/what_is_something_your_so_has_done_that/,166,1482300891.0,,2016-12-21 01:14:51
What is something your SO has done that absolutely broke your heart?,"Lying is the biggest thing that broke my heart. This is about my ex, but he stayed my SO for a long time despite multiple lies. I don't think he even cheated or did anything wrong, but lying about talking to other girls is not okay.  
It also broke my heart how little he actually cared about what I wanted in my future. He just expected me to go along with whatever he wanted.  
These were all issues that led to our break up. The fact that these actions broke my heart meant I knew deep down we'd have to break up. It just took me a long ass time to get to that point.

We were born in different countries and while I wanted to travel he didn't. I moved to Canada for him and during the immigration application period (a year or so) I could have gone home and worked but he told me he wanted me to stay with him as he was tired of us being apart. 

He had always been obsessed with his weight/health/fitness and made comments on mine (it goes up and down) which was a point of contention in our relationship. 

He confessed during an argument years later that he thought if I went back to my home country while we waited, I would gain weight and he felt if he kept an eye on me I would continue to lose it. 

It was more important I keep my weight down than have the last year with my family, that last year to earn money, that last year to be independent. All because of a few pounds.

What is something your SO has done that absolutely broke your heart?,"So me and my ex broke up because he just wasn't doing anything with me. No sex, no plans. He would say ""I"" instead of ""we"". I tried to make it work, and he just didn't do anything to save it, so I left.

Recently, my ex started seeing somebody new. I was crushed. I found out in a publication. I did something really awful and selfish, and I called him a few days after I found out. He had kept in my life for the whole year we had been apart, there was no space to move on, and I told him I just didn't think I could ever be his friend, see him marry somebody else and have kids, because he was the only person in my life I had ever opened up to the idea of doing that with. There was a lot of crying.

It ended with me saying I would do anything to have been able to make it work because I couldn't imagine loving anybody else, which is something I had said before. He, in tears, told me he felt the same, but just didn't think he could be who he thought I needed him to be.

It broke my heart because of a couple of reasons- obviously hearing that emotion was killer. The guilt of having rung him in that moment of weakness despite knowing somebody else was involved was also awful. But mostly, knowing that he would admit that whilst with somebody new, and that he is probably not going to have learned that relationships take focus and work and will repeat the mistakes also weighs heavily.

Also, less than an hour after, a photo came up on my twitter of them at another event together, one that I might have been at if I had felt less drained as it was a friend's event that I had introduced him to. He won everything.",191,5jg5ty,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/5jg5ty/what_is_something_your_so_has_done_that/,166,1482300891.0,,2016-12-21 01:14:51
What is something your SO has done that absolutely broke your heart?,"Well it broke my heart after everything was already over.

Dated this guy, he was super nice and sweet and all. Yeah I really loved this guy. Anyway, months into our relationship, this one day he's getting really teary, saying ""I love you, you're amazing, I don't ever want to lose you."" At first I was wondering, *why is he crying about this?*. But I ignored that and just comforted him.

Months later, I found out he's cheating on me. And he was cheating on me from the moment we started dating. All those months, just a waste of time. So what *really* broke my heart was the fact that he 'cried'. He didn't want to 'lose me' and he 'loved me', yet he was cheating on me that exact moment. 

Today, I can't trust anyone who says 'I love you', and on top of that I have low self esteem. Every time my (new) SO says it, I keep thinking, ""What if he's lying? He doesn't really love me. Who would love this? He's lying.""

What is something your SO has done that absolutely broke your heart?,"He's my ex now and this contributed to me not wanting to be with him anymore. We had a pregnancy scare and he freaked out on me. He wasn't ready for kids and I was on the same page, so I was planning on scheduling an abortion the moment a pregnancy test turned positive, but mentally he couldn't handle it. Like, he wanted me to get an abortion but at the same time I think he was struggling with the fact that he'd always judged people for needing them in the first place. He wasn't very experienced sexually so I don't think he realized that condoms aren't infallible and that if you have enough sex you might eventually have to choose between parenthood, adoption, or abortion.

He made everything about him and how freaked out he was. Never once asked me how I was doing or how I felt. He wasn't even going to need to contribute financially because my health insurance covers abortion. He was just so incredibly self centered about the whole thing.

I ended up getting my period very late and I suspect it was an early miscarriage. My periods are never late and it was super heavy and painful. Did he care? Nope. Throughout the whole ordeal he was the opposite of supportive and I realized I can't depend on him in a crisis. He was 30 years old.

What is something your SO has done that absolutely broke your heart?,"Stated that it's ok to cheat on your partner if they're dying. Seriously, what the fuck? Shouldn't you be spending the last time you have together with your soon to be dead partner instead of, you know, trolling tinder for a booty call?

He pretty much got this idea in his head after his grandfather watched his second wife die and dutifully stayed by her side. Her death made him deeply bitter and vastly changed who he was as a person (it didn't help that she was fifteen years younger than him and the death was totally unexpected). 

My husband is convinced that if he had gotten sex during that time that he wouldn't be as bitter as he is today. Which makes zero fucking sense to me. 

I can only hope that if we are ever faced with that problem, and I die before my husband (who is twelve years older than me, so again, unexpected) that he will do the right thing.

What is something your SO has done that absolutely broke your heart?,"Oh boy where to start...

Former SO, but senior year of high school he came to my state (we were in a ldr) for prom, ended up losing my virginity while he was there. He goes back home, completely ghosts me for 2 weeks. Not a text, phone call, or any form of contact, just nothing. I'll admit my form of ""revenge"" was petty and childish, but he knew how important that was to me and he made me feel like a fucktoy. I was heartbroken for a bit but I got over it. Your first love is always the hardest. 

Down the line there was Yeti. Yeti is a nickname for someone who told me he loved me, someone who I'd crushed on multiple times in the years that we knew each other. We had some form of relationship, and he didn't break my heart once, but twice. First was when I sent a NSFW photo and his ""roommate"" (aka girlfriend) put a stop to that. Time passes, he apologizes, and stupid me agrees to try again... only to have him fall for another girl, get her pregnant, and then name that child what I have wanted to name a son should I ever have the blessing. Moral of the story: fuck you Brandon, and fuck you for stealing that name. 


But I am with a wonderful man now, and we may have our disagreements and arguments now and then, but there's no one else I'd rather have as my player 2. c:",191,5jg5ty,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/5jg5ty/what_is_something_your_so_has_done_that/,166,1482300891.0,,2016-12-21 01:14:51

The next day, when, with a smile, I ask her ""when should we go to the theater"" she tells me, alongside apologies, her friends didn't remember they had to work and went eating sushis and watching the movie but that she would love to see it again with me.

What is something your SO has done that absolutely broke your heart?,"We were abroad for a few months, and had broken up during the first month of the trip. We reconciled over Skype, and he surprised me in France, showing up at my friend's flat. I was SO happy, we had this whole romantic coming together moment. 

Not even a half hour later, he was on Facebook chatting with his ex-girlfriend, who he had wanted to marry and was very in love with when they dated (and possibly still was at the time of the trip, still don't know). I was so hurt, and aside from the actual ACT, he also didn't understand why that would hurt me. 

I think that hurt more, that he didn't understand how that was just the equivalent to him ripping my heart out. I had already felt inadequate to her, something I had voiced, after he had shared intimacies of their relationship with me, telling me that he reached a certain level of certainty about her during their relationship, that he had (admittedly) not reached with me yet. 

That whole experience was like a splinter I could never quite pick out.

I was told that there was nothing wrong and that I should definitely serve my treats, so I did later. When dinner rolled around, we served my baked goods to the guests and one after the other, they tactlessly told me that they weren't good. One person even threw out my cupcake in the trash after one bite in front of my face. 

Okay, so a lot of people broke my heart that night, but after that was done and over with, I spoke to my SO and he told me that he didn't have the heart to tell me the truth. I was hurt that he pretty much let me serve crappy cupcakes to the guests, knowing that they weren't good. I felt as though he let me humiliate myself.

What is something your SO has done that absolutely broke your heart?,"One SO broke up with me on my 18th birthday, but I didn't find out from him.  He told my sister, her best friend, one of his exes, and his best guy friend. I found out from my sister, and then got a phone call from the ex telling me what a wonderful guy he was, and how we should stay friends. Yeah, okay....

Earlier this year, my boyfriend was working a road job. I was really excited to see him, and wanted to spend all of our free time together. (Who doesn't want to spend time with their SO??)

So, being the thoughtful person I am, I made sure to pack up some lasagna leftovers to take over, so he'd have food when he got home. The entire time this was happening, he  was talking to me about how he was delayed and wouldn't be home until Saturday (This was Thursday or Friday afternoon).

I get ready to leave, and when I get to his house, I see his truck in the driveway.  No big deal, maybe he car pooled with his friend,  since they occasionally work together. Except all the lights are on in the house, and I'm pretty positive he's home. I tried calling and texting to no avail, so I turned around and went home. Was really tempted to throw the food at his house or leave it out on the hood of his truck.

I get home, and have a long chat with him about how he's been home since Thursday, and he only told me he wasn't off until Saturday because he wanted to be left alone. And he thought if he told me he wanted alone time, I'd be upset. Except he didn't seem to think that lying to me was going to make me more upset in the long run.

Occasionally, I think about this, and I used to wonder if he had lied to me before about where he was. But now we live together, and as far as I know, there hasn't been any more lies.",191,5jg5ty,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/5jg5ty/what_is_something_your_so_has_done_that/,166,1482300891.0,,2016-12-21 01:14:51

wish u the best- Black bear
“I’d wish you the best but you already had it”

do re mi- blackbear
“do re mi fa so fucking done with you”
“If I could go back to the day we met I probably would just stay in bed”

you & me- Marc E Bassy

Another Sad Love Song- Khalid
“Bridges they are burning”

Selfish girls- jake Miller
“I was gonna write you a love song just the other day, so I sat down and thought real hard but nothing ever came”

Cold as ice- foreigner
“You’re as cold as ice” (duh)

You give Love a bad name- Bon Jovi
in the title

Gives you Hell- the American rejects (this is ofc the best of all the songs
“hope it gives you Hell”

RIP- Olivia O’Brien
“rip to the old you, I miss the old you, it’s like you’re dead to me now”

I hope these work!!

Great song for when you're glad to be rid of someone who had some sort of power over you. 

>There's a place where everyone can be right  
Even though you remain determined to be opposed  
Admittance requires no qualifications  
It's where everyone has been and where everybody goes  
  
>  
>So please try not to be impatient  
For we all hate standing in line  
And when the farm is good and bought  
You'll be there without a thought  
And eternity, my friend, is a long fucking time  
  
>  
>Because there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend  
But baby I'm amazed at the hate that you can send and  
You... painted my entire world  
But I  
Don't have the turpentine to clean what you have soiled  
And I won't forget it

What is your biggest book to screen disappointment? The Magicians is breaking my goddamn heart with all of these horrific changes.,"*The Hunger Games* - they were doing so well, and then they utterly betrayed their source material in the final instalment.  It's not *meant* to have a feel-good ending, Hollywood!  It's *meant* to be bittersweet and a bit depressing!

I normally enjoy myself at adaptations, because I expect large, shiny, expensive fan-fiction *based on* the stories I love reading - certain cinematic tropes and certainly time and budgetary constraints limit how much of my favourite worlds will make it to screen.

Incidentally, I'll put up with a lot of things from screen adaptations, because I generally go into them expecting a dolled-up fantasy version of my favourite plots and characters.  The only thing I find utterly inexcusable is the addition of random characters for no apparent reason other than a tacked-on romantic plot (because not all plots have or need that), the excision of characters who were key to plots in the source material, and the utter violation of changing the ending to something more ""happy.""",133,4ezskh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/4ezskh/what_is_your_biggest_book_to_screen/,327,1460797685.0,Seriously I don't care that Lev Grossman (the author) approved the changes.

What is your biggest book to screen disappointment? The Magicians is breaking my goddamn heart with all of these horrific changes.,"I love Miyazaki. That's the first thing I'm going to make very clear here. I've always been a big fan of his films, and when TCM does a marathon...I am on it like Donkey Kong.

That being said, when I first heard he would be involved with an adaptation of 'Howl's Moving Castle', I was unbelievably excited. It was absolutely one of my favorite books growing up, and I had read it so many times that the binding on my copy completely wore down.

The day I finally saw the film, my heart broke. I understand that film is a  medium in which it's pretty much impossible to faithfully adapt a book or story 100% unless it's as short as 'The Old Man and the Sea', I really do...but there were so very many changes in the movie that I could hardly even recognize it. Pretty much the only thing they nailed was the fact that Howl was vain, the castle moved, and Sophie cleaned a lot when she got stuck in an old woman's body.

They got rid of her sister, who had a really fun little side story in the book, they changed a lot of what made her an interesting protagonist, they made the Witch of the Waste absolutely hideous, which was very far from what she was in the book. Calcifer wasn't nearly as much of a selfish jerk as he should have been. And Michael was a teenager in the book, not a little boy...who fell in love with Sophie's sister.

God, there's so many things that bugged me about the movie. Of course it was a visual feast, and the story they made was interesting in it's own right...but it was far from being remotely similar to the one they based it on.",133,4ezskh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/4ezskh/what_is_your_biggest_book_to_screen/,327,1460797685.0,Seriously I don't care that Lev Grossman (the author) approved the changes.

What is your biggest book to screen disappointment? The Magicians is breaking my goddamn heart with all of these horrific changes.,"I only saw the pilot episode of The Magicians and I was pretty disappointed. It looks good, especially for a SyFy production, but it felt like an utterly generic ""ordinary guy discovers magical world in which he is destined to become a hero, immediately gets awarded Smart/Sexy/Snarky Sidekicks and has an adventure!"". And the book is essentially the opposite in tone - Quentin thinks this discovery will fix his life and that magic is what's been missing, only to find out he's perfectly capable of being unhappy in Narnia/Hogwarts too, and then it turns out he's not a particularly great magician and no one's telling him he's the Chosen One and here is the meaning in life he's been looking for. He's still an unhappy, aimless guy, just one who can do magic if he works really hard, and then it turns out a lot of magicians are actually chronically bored because there's a real shortage of Voldemorts and White Witches and they're living life on ridiculously easy mode. I hope the series picks up as I would be interested in watching more, but that first episode felt like the producers took away ""Harry Potter, but SEXY!"" from the books and nothing else.

And another huge disappointment for me - Lucifer. They took a gorgeous, complex story in the Sandman universe that went between fantasy worlds and had a rich mixture of mythologies and a great cast of characters, and turned it into a shitty procedural show about a smartass supernatural detective who solves a different crime each week.

What is your biggest book to screen disappointment? The Magicians is breaking my goddamn heart with all of these horrific changes.,"World War Z had very little to do with the book.


They could have cut the book down a bit into the key stories from each segment and had Brad Pit be the guy going around interviewing survivors.  A lead roll offering mostly monologues and some back and forth with survivors for perspective on everything.  The meat of the movie would be in the flashbacks of the survivors.   They could have used the expendables strategy and cast a ton of stars to be the lead in their own short story. But nope.  We get a bastardized pile of crap where brad is basically a superhero who relies on luck, the zombies are portrayed as if nobody on board had read the book,  yet they have a few nods to it to show that they had.  There's no war against the zombies with modern tactics failing horribly, no redeaming war with huge firing lines,  the great panic is over in a day. It shares the title of the book, walls around Israel, and using dogs to weed out the infected.   I can't recall any more similarities. 

I'm most upset that a true adaptation is now very unlikely.

What is your biggest book to screen disappointment? The Magicians is breaking my goddamn heart with all of these horrific changes.,"Maybe it's just me, but I'm enormously impressed by the revisions in the TV adaptation of *The Magicians*. Nothing much happens in the book until it's halfway done, and the TV show really expands the relative roles of everyone in the story who isn't Quentin, which is always a big plus. The stuff that got cut was just, frankly, faffing around; everything that's been changed works well in context.

Here's an example of what I mean: The Brakebill's South South Pole race between Quentin and Alice has, basically, no function in the book except to show off how awesome Alice is. That's cool. Thing is, the TV Show's been making an overt point that Alice is an epic badass since she first showed up, in basically every scene and subplot, and even Quentin has acknowledged the fact. She always does things first. She always fixes the problem. She always figures out how to do stuff. Since the show's been weaving her excellence throughout itself, the polar race would be a stupid and pointless waste of time.

Here's another: Jane's dead. Massive change. Thing is, the book held back on the Watcher Woman/Jane thing till the very end, but that's not something that you can sustain on screen, where viewers can see actress' faces. So, they owned both that *and* the timeloop early and then, by killing her, sharpened the stakes. In the book, Jane was this incredibly powerful demigoddess by virtue of the fact that she could just experiment forever until she got things right, and never once was at serious risk from the Beast. That makes the whole ridiculous quest kind of stupid; why couldn't she just have used her magic watch to trap the Beast within a closed timeloop and have had done with it all? If she's vulnerable, though, then the Beast is more dangerous and what Quentin and co. do is much, much more important.

One last one: The whole presentation and reinterpretation of Julia's story, which is probably the most radical change in the entire storyline. Julia comes out of *nowhere* 3/4 of the way through the book, and we get dumped on with her story, which was parallel to Quentin's in the first place (that being rather the point); if you're going to do that anyway, then it makes great sense to *actually* parallel them, especially on TV. It really builds her up, because as she's having genuine, existential, life-and-death struggles, Quentin's drowning his self-pity in alcohol, Alice, and Eliott, she's learning what it really means to live in a world where her magic can reshape everything. It doubles down on the core theme of the book, reinforces a character who really always gets short shrift in the books (even in the sequels, she's distant and dreamy as hell, and kind of seriously passive), and makes Quentin look like the massively whiny, self-pitying, self-centered jackass that he is.

Change for change's sake is generally stupid, I agree. Thing is, every change I can think of in the TV adaptation of *The Magicians* is a substantial improvement on the original text. It feels like a revision that the book really, really needed.",133,4ezskh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/4ezskh/what_is_your_biggest_book_to_screen/,327,1460797685.0,Seriously I don't care that Lev Grossman (the author) approved the changes.

To those with close / good / best male friends. What do you do when said friend gets into a relationship and disappears?,"This is very close to me, but maybe I got to rant it out. 

Met a guy in my final year of Uni, during my part time stint, and initially we did not like each other much. Classic situation where I thought he was lazy, didn't bother with anything, and he thought I was stuck up, putting too much energy into things that didn't matter. Being forced to work together after a few months meant we surprisingly got along. By the end of the year, him and I got really, really close. He broke up with his girlfriend, I was going through unreciprocated feelings with someone else - we didn't even know it, but I guess we helped each other. 

Fast forward a year, 2016/17, him and I are still good friends - admittedly on my part because he moved countries and I was the only one who would always call to check up, message etc etc. It never bugged me too much then. He started seeing a girl, and I guess I felt my heart break. But anyhow, kept quiet and maintained the friendship for the longest period, still calling and texting, like normal. 

Last year, I had a career block and issues at home to deal with too at the time, so admittedly I looked to him for support and distraction, hoping he'd be there the way I was when he facing similar issues a few years back. My calls were not an everyday occurrence.  Maybe once in two weeks? Or a week? And I never moaned about my situation, I just used to call to take my mind off of stuff. So his relationship with his girlfriend had already gotten serious at that point. And so he then barely called back if he missed my calls, barely messaged back (where before, he always would) and everytime I tried my best to explain how much it used to hurt that I was constantly left on read, or never got a call back, he just said ""I know I don't do enough"" but never rectified it. 

I stopped calling and he never called back. 7 months no contact. Corona came, I sent a message to check up on him, he ignored it. Called him, he picked up and acted like I was the one who left and not been pushed away. I hate it. I can't believe he's changed so much. I miss him everyday. 

So in short, I tried to hold on. So much. Realised I'm the one hurting more and had to let go. It still hurts like crazy. And I genuinely don't know what to do about it. Can't even hate him because I just have too much fondness in my heart for him. Sucks!
