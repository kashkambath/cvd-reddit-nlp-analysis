"My dad had a heart attack and spent over 7 minutes without oxygen. He was paddle shocked 5 times and now jokes ""when I die...again..."". He says there was absolutely nothing. No ""white light"", no ""seeing your whole life before your eyes"". Nothing. He said it wasn't even scary since there just wasn't anything. The most jarring thing for him was that he woke up from his medically induced coma earlier than they expected and they didn't have anyone available to pull out his breathing tube, so he was awake for a good 10 hours before they could remove it. He was looking at us very oddly, but couldn't verbalize what the deal was. Apparently all his colors were jumbled and my very white mom looked almost eggplant purple to him. His black nurse wasn't a normal person color at all. When he was finally able to talk he asked my mom why she was purple. Then he asked the nurse if she was black, but he fought with finding words that weren't offensive until he stopped caring about trying and just blurted out ""are you black?!""",1
"I had dangerous open heart surgery due to multiple congenital heart defects at 4 years old. 

I was on ECMO life support where the heart is not beating. I remember before and after the surgery but I have no memory of during the surgery, so no supernatural experience for me. 

It was very traumatic so I may have blocked some of these memories.",1
"In June of 2020, my Dad collapsed in our yard while helping us mow the lawn. He's an older guy, 3-time cancer survivor with dizziness issues but this was a worse fall than we'd ever seen him. He insisted to my Mom that he was fine, and that she didn't need to worry about him. We were both skeptical, but we took his word and kept a close eye on him for the rest of the day.

Fast forward to a cardiology appointment I took him to in October. He was joking with his nurse that he didn't know why he even had a pacemaker put in back in 2015 or so, since it's not like it did anything when she looked him dead in the eyes and said, ""I beg to differ.""

Turns out his collapse was a heart attack, and he flatlined. If it wasn't for the pacemaker in his chest shocking his heart back into rhythm, he would have died right then and there. The good news is they figured out where the blockage was in his heart that caused the problem, and put a stent in. So he's doing alright, all things considered.

He later admitted to my Mom and I that it felt like he was being buried. He kept trying to climb out of the pit he was in, towards a bright light, but he never could get anywhere. And then he woke up. He didn't want to tell us when it happened, because he knew we would bring him to the ER.",1
"after my twin aunts were born, my grandma became severely ill and was clinically dead for a while. she claims to have had an out of body experience and that she went to heaven. apparently, from above she saw herself on the table with doctors trying to save her, and then woke up somewhere she didn’t recognise, but felt overwhelming peace, like she had never felt before, just complete peace and bliss. she then saw a man, and getting closer she saw it was a man whose name i think was harvey, or something along those lines. she grew up in a children’s home as her parents were refugees, and the only joy she had was when this man visited her each month before she aged out and he passed away. in heaven, she approached him and he told her it wasn’t her time yet, she hadn’t done everything she needed to do on earth. so she went back and recovered completely. she’s now my best friend.

i’ve had a couple close calls from suicide attempts but it’s just been pain and darkness.",1
"Not me but my mother is the most severe case I can think of.

Around 25 she started regularly having episodes of severe heart arrhythmias. So bad she fainted and seriously thought she would die (and once almost did because it happened while she was driving). Every doctor she saw told her she was just having panic attacks or was hysterically imagining things and that is wasn\`t as bad as she made it out to be, because by the time she reached the doctor the attack was over and she didn't show any signs of a heart attack in the EKGs. It took more than a dozen cardiologists and over 20 years of visiting doctors for one to finally believe her. She has Wolff-Parkinson-White-Syndrom in combination with a  disorder causing the blood to clot faster and form miniscule clots that reach the heart and trigger an attack but disolve later and can't be detected. She takes blood thinners now and hasn\`t had an attack since.",1

"As a doctor, this thread is causing me chest pain. Some of these things you can actually get very sick from. Or get cancer from. Or die from. ",1
"Do you happen to have high cholesterol? I've noticed this tends to be more common in people who have it. Taking care of the cholesterol won't necessarily do much for the current cyst, but may prevent others. Of course, this is only because I've had relatives who had it diagnosed.",1
"Cholesterol can be crazy. Even when I was a meat eater I had great cholesterol (160s range), and I'm fat. Meanwhile, my thin husband's always had cholesterol in the 200+ range, whether he's eaten meat, not eaten it, etc. He eats OK and gets plenty of movement in.

People have a lot of control of their health, but I think it frightens people to acknowledge just how much they also DON'T control. Family history plays a big role and we like to shy away from that because we want someone or something to blame.

"It was scary.  I actually had a series of four to five in 24 hours.  I  had never had any previous cardiac issues.  I was only 43 at the time, and I quite suddenly became nauseous and sweaty while showering.  I tried to finish up my shower and couldn’t.  I collapsed into my bed soaking wet and starting experiencing pain under my left breast, wrapping around my side to the back, my left shoulder up the left side of my neck.  I was shaking and my heart rate was high (I was able to have my son grab a pulse oximeter).  My poor teenage boys had to call an ambulance, and they were literally going to send me home from the ER because all the tests were coming back fine.  The only thing that caught it was my troponin levels increased-that’s how they knew heart damage had occurred.  It was labeled NSTEMI.  We never did find the cause-it wasn’t due to a blockage, so the doctors attributed it to an arrhythmia.  They haven’t found the arrhythmia problem to this day, I’m not on any blood thinners, and the cardiac doctors have given me a clean bill of health.  I still get concerned whenever I start getting hot/sweaty/nauseous at all, since I would have never expected those to be associated with having a heart attack, especially in my forties.  I hope this answers your question.",1
"OMD totally scary 

I was on campus when it happened.  Buying breakfast before class, when suddenly I had a hard time breathing.  It was like the air was too warm to breathe.  I collected my breakfast, put it in my bag and quickly took my stuff to the first aid room.  I then collapsed on the floor, took my jacket, scarf, hoodie and hat off, and security called for first aid.  They called the ambulance who thought it was either asthma, acid reflux, anxiety, or an allergic reaction.  We decided to go to the hospital.  They took an EKG and said something isn't right.  Immediately to the trauma bay and this point onwards is a bit of a blur in my memory.  But they transferred me to another hospital.  They took me to the Cath Lab and put a stent in my artery via my wrist.  It was incredibly painful.  There was also something heavy on my chest. The pain from the heart attack combined with whatever heavy item was on my chest, made me feel really nauseous and unwell.  After surgery, I was in the hospital for 6 days.  I couldn't move my wrist for 24 hours, and an IV line was put in my other arm, so I couldn't move that either.  My parents had to help me with meals because of both arms being immovable.  I also hadn't eaten since the night before because my breakfast was still in my bag.  I was the youngest on the ward.  This was 2 months ago.  And I am still learning how to deal with it day by day.  I have 5 new meds to take.  I gotta check my weight everyday, and my blood pressure, and heart rate have to be monitored.  I got a Fitbit to monitor my heart rate since the clinics are closed.  I have since been diagnosed with a condition called SCAD which is the cause of my heart attack.",1
"I had my first one at 18 years old. My entire left side went numb, I became extremely dizzy, disoriented, cold sweats and nauseated. I went to the hospital and was told my troponin levels were elevated and I likely experienced a ""heart related event."" I was never told it was a 'heart attack' but it was more likely a 'transient ischemic attack.' In any case, both of those events are centered around the inability to get oxygen normally to a part of the body (brain/heart/lungs) due to a clot or other vascular issue. I was given no meds, not asked to stay for observation, nothing.

The wildest thing to me is that at that time, it was well-known that I was having issues with my energy/tiredness due to my heart condition. I had surgery as a baby and needed surgery less than a year after this even to close an atrial septal defect in the middle of the atria of my heart that had gotten to be 15 mm wide.

I do not think women are taken as seriously as men when it comes to heart attacks. Men have symptoms that are more ""textbook"" while women definitely do not. But when your heart is fucking up, boy can you tell. Whether you're a man or a woman. I have since learned to advocated for my own health - its easy to do when you have a chronic heart condition from birth.",1
"I think it is important for women to share symptoms because they are often atypical. I never experienced any pain but woke up feeling incredibly dizzy with an extremely cold feeling inside my chest. Lots of heart issues in my family so I called for an ambulance at 6:30 a.m. By 10:00 I was in open heart surgery for a quadruple bypass. Apparently I had a heart attack on the table but because they had already started I survived. Had I been at home at the time I probably would not have made it to the hospital. I now eat a plant based diet, exercise regularly and feel great two years post surgery.",1
"I don't know. I didn't realize that I had one until having tests done afterwards that showed there was damage from it. I did not have the traditional symptoms and did not recognize it as a heart attack while it was occurring. I've always had a couple of heart conditions, so I'm used to feeling the effects from those, but it must not have presented that way at the time.",1
"I was 32, a Kindergarten teacher. It was 1995. I’d been taking a triptan drug for migraine headaches for a couple of years. This one particular occasion, a few hours after I took the tablet, I began to feel terrible pressure in my chest and up into the left side of my jaw. I honestly thought it was indigestion at first and chewed some antacid tablets. The pressure and feeling of panic grew. I called my parents. They got me and drove me to the local ER. 

It was set up with a “triage” nurse at a desk where you came in. The nurse wrote down your symptoms and sent your name to the back. You were told to go to the waiting area and wait until a nurse came out and called your name. 

So, I went to the desk and said I was having chest pains and was starting to feel nauseated. The nurse looked at me and said, “Well, you’re not having a heart attack. Go sit over there and wait for someone to call you.” We sat down. I remember that I started sweating and I was moaning as the pain in my chest intensified. It was very crowded, children crying, noise, smells...we’d been waiting over an hour when I found myself suddenly on my hands and knees puking on some random guy’s foot. 

Just at that moment one of the ER nurses came out from the treatment area to call the next patient and saw me. Turns out she was the mother of one of my students. She rushed me to the back, heard the words “chest pain” and had the doctor, an IV, nitro, EKG all inside 15 minutes. 

I was in the ICU for 2 days, had a cardiac cath, and stress test. It was determined that I had no blockage or other cardiac disease. However, the triptan migraine drug had caused me to have spasms in my coronary artery. They were severe enough to cause a myocardial infarction that left me with moderate heart damage.",1
"Not me, but my mother. A few weeks ago, my mother decided to go out and hang out with her friend. That night, I was surprised that I didn't get a goodnight text or any of the sort as she would always either call me or text me. I thought nothing of it as she probably fell asleep. The next morning, I noticed how my mother wasn't home. Once again, I thought nothing of it and that she probably wanted to spend more time with her friend. 

The next day, I was starting to get worried until she called me. She said that she was in the hospital, and that she ended up getting a heart attack. I gave my step father the phone as she wanted to talk to him, and he didn't even believe her. He truly didn't believe that my mother was in the hospital and just passed it off as ""trying to start an argument."" It took nearly an hour for him to realize that my mother was serious as he could hear one of the machines through the phone. I had to stay away from my step father that weekend as I would have cursed him out for that. 

Two days later, we picked my mother up from the hospital, and we learned that she was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. During the time at home, she always said how her shoulder hurts, and I had to massage it time to time. She also had many dark bruises on her arms. A few weeks later she is doing fine. Her shoulder still hurts but it's getting better. I'm just happy that she's here with me.

Edit: Fixed some typos",1
"My mum had a heart attack at 51.  She had struggled with heart burn for years anyway, so when she had those feelings she wasn’t too concerned.  She woke up in the night and was vomiting and my dad went to help her.  He said that she went all floppy and clammy and very pale.  My dad was in the army for 24 years and he’s had some medical training so he guessed she was having a heart attack and called 999 immediately.  My mum didn’t even want him to call the ambulance because she didn’t think it could be that serious. 

When they arrived they did tests and said that she had had a heart attack.  She was denying it even to the paramedics! I don’t know the exact details of it but she had a blockage and they removed it by going through her vein and into her artery (again, I don’t know the exact details).  She had smoked since she was 15 so she quit straight away and cleaned up her diet, as well as going on several medications.  4 years later and she’s fine! She was also diagnosed as pre-diabetic but she’s managed to control that.

I wasn’t actually there for any of this because this took place during my first year at uni.  But yeah, even my mum, in the midst of a heart attack, was denying that she was having a heart attack.  Medical advice is so clearly aimed at men, and it could have cost my mum her life if my dad hadn’t been there and acted on his instinct and knowledge.",1
"As someone with PTSD related to ""feeling heart attacks"", I don't think I'll ever know the difference between them and my panic attacks.",1
"My mother died from a “widow maker” heart attack. The left anterior descending artery was 90% occluded when they did the autopsy. She had been complaining of issues off and on but kept writing them off as something else. The morning she died and the night before she had complained of nausea. The ER doctor told us she most likely was having a heart attack for hours and didn’t realize it. I was not with her when she died. 

Now whenever I feel suddenly nauseous I panic.",1
"suffered a heart attack one week after i gave birth. had a sudden coronary artery dissection (SCAD) due to pregnancy. i had no clue pregnancy increases the risk of a heart attack! i was in ICU for a week, had a cardiac catheterization, and they found the torn artery. i was 28 with normal weight, no drinking and smoking, and no medical history. was put on coumadin (blood thinner) for a month. the worst part was pumping my breast milk and throwing them out. after a month of normal healing, they decided that i was pretty much back to normal (95%). now 13 years later, life is fairly uneventful. i just couldn’t do major exercises (heart rate no higher than 130). i was supposed to see a cardiologist every year but life happened. until three years ago, i was diagnosed with breast cancer. now i see a cardiologist every year. once i’m off tamoxifen (for the cancer), i’ll resume daily baby aspirin",1
"Mom had sort of the same thing. We took her to the ER and they said she didn’t have any signs, but because it’s a rural hospital they sent her to the city. They said her triponin (sp?) started out really low, but kept increasing.

The first cardiologist said they “might” have to put 1 maybe 2 stents in, but once they started doing the procedure realized she needed quadruple bypass surgery.",1
"Dang, the beginning of this sounded like my hot flashes with perimenopause... until you mentioned the pain. 

I have a 30% blockage in the left main artery (widowmaker). Before they found out how mild it actually was, I was 2 DAYS from a double bypass surgery.  I was freaking terrified at 48 years old. Dx with PTSD not long after that hospital stay.  I take my cholesterol medication & calcium blockers religiously now. I try to eat better & take my supplements. Exercise with my other health issues is difficult, but I love to walk.",1
"How high was your heart rate? I'm always worried I'll ignore signs of a heart attack because I have hEDS and POTS, which causes regular pain in my chest, ribs, shoulders, arms, neck and back along with a very high heart rate most of the time.",1
"This is so frustrating. It’s been very well known in science now that heart attacks in women are fairly different than in men. And a lot of doctors still are not paying enough attention on this matter.

I’m sorry to hear you didn’t get that treatment you deserve! I hope you are in better health now! Please in doubt go to a doctor! You know what you feel!!",1
"My story is very similar but I had a stroke at 27.   Luckily my cardiologist was European and took it more seriously than the American doctors (I’m in the US).  We will just say the heart defect was more widely recognized and understood in Europe and covered by insurance where in the US it’s a battle to get it done.   After lots of heart issues they closed the hole in my heart as well.  My cardiologist told the people who deal with insurance that I was likely to have additional more severe strokes, so it was a “cheaper” preventative measure.  My energy level, stress, migraines, everything improved so drastically.  Seriously a whole new life.",1
"It's sort of infuriating that the signs of both a heart attack and an anxiety attack are largely the same for women, and we don't always know if it's the former until it's dangerously past when we should be getting help. I'm so happy you survived!",1
"I read heart attacks in women tend to have different symptoms than men's, so the publicized symptoms don't often match Women's heart attacks. What was your experience?",1
"The same thing happened to me-- they found heart damage on an EKG while doing a routine pre-surgery check. I was only 29 so it was pretty odd...

Stress tests showed nothing of note. Heart is perfectly functional otherwise so we went ahead with surgery. I can't recall any time where I experienced any cardiac symptoms (including the ""atypical"" ones women get) so I really do wonder. The cardiologist suggested it might be also be congenital damage or a weird placement thing. I don't have any trouble with exercise or any day to day things so the doctors told me not to worry.",1
Wow! It's really great your doctor figured it out. I have POTS and EDS too and this is my worst fear--how will I tell my normal symptoms from a heart attack?,1
"Omg. ""Well, you're not having a heart attack"" YIKES. I hope that nurse rethought **that** one after what happened.",1
Which triptan??? I know this was 1995 but I’m so concerned. I have migraines and my mother died of a heart attack in 2014 at 67.,1
"Hi there! At 16, unless you have a pretty serious congenital heart issue, it’s almost unheard of to have a heart attack. It takes time for arteriosclerosis to build up in your blood vessels and cause a blockage, and it’s very unlikely to happen by the time you’re 16. It’s possible that you have another cardiac issue, such as an arrhythmia, but what is much more likely is anxiety attacks. They’re extremely common and can mimic a lot of the symptoms of a heart attack (ie. difficulty breathing, chest pain, shaking, sweating, nausea, headache, etc.). I suspect that’s probably why your doctor said ‘it’s nothing’ in response to your symptoms. They can feel like you’re dying but have no lasting effects, so it’s hard for medical professionals to detect them once they’re over.",1
"Thank you so much, a definite bump on my life journey I was not expecting at my age for sure, but appreciating listening to baby birds outside my window at 7am now 💜. Always a positive in the negatives if you look. I think its the whole numb left arm etc, seemingly a lot of women dont get that, and it's the symptom most people ""look"" for in association with a heart attack. So we do tend to ""brush off"" major signs and symptoms until it's at crisis point unfortunately.",1
"I'm not a doctor, in any shape or form but I'd think, purely from my experience, you would know if you had a heart attack. I get anxiety pretty bad and have done for years but there was literally a period of probably not even 2 hours between what I thought could've been really bad anxiety and realising that something was seriously wrong, and I now have a metal stent in my heart keeping one of my very much needed valves open, which I'm told stopped the pain and feelings I had. Not a ""feeling"" I ever want to experience again, but very quickly becomes obvious it's not just anxiety/attack and didnt go away at all for me, so I wouldn't worry too much but most definitely speak to your doctor and explain your worries, and a simple test should hopefully be able to put your mind at ease. I'm hoping I'm helping more than hindering here",1
"That's correct, and one reason why women are more likely to not survive. Research on heart attacks was conducted on men, and it's only recently that these differences are being discussed. 

This situation extends to many, many other areas of life, from medication dosage recommendations, to seatbelt placement.",1
"It really varies person to person. I've seen both classic (Crushing chest pain with and without radiation to other parts of the body) and non classic (Dizzy, Nausea/ Vomiting, Flu like symptoms) from both genders. I think because a heart attack can have such vague symptoms is why almost all ER patients now get an EKG and at least 1 troponin level done. 

Not so fun fact: uncontrolled diabetes can damage nerves enough that your body doesn't receive the ""Chest pain announcement"" and is one of the many reasons practitioners push so hard to keep diabetes under control.",1
To be fair she was also 14. It’s not common at all for teens to get heart attacks which is likely why they said it was probably nothing,1
,
"This comment has scared me. A few months ago before christmas I woke up in the middle of the night suddenly feeling very sick, I ran to the bathroom, my temp suddenly spiked, I went dizzy and passed out on the bathroom floor. When I woke up, I felt tired but better, not sick anymore just had a bit of a headache that didn't pass for a couple of days, I never went to the doctors because i put it down to being a migraine as I do get them but never like that. There is a history of heart trouble in my family, my dad passed from it before his 40th birthday and I am 36 now. Obviously doctors have other things on their plate to deal with now so I won't be going until it happens again but at least I know the signs now.",1
"I don’t know- I took a shower before and the whole time I was thinking is this a heart attack or am I just worrying? Lmao.

SUCKS",1
"The first doctor was female, and wasn't really interested in what I had to say. I'm in the UK so I use the NHS, and from personal experience I'd say the system as a whole isn't really interested. I do have a male doctor now who's a lot more friendly than the previous one, so funnily enough I actually think he'd pay more attention to me.

I realise where you're coming from and I do appreciate the concern, but at the same time I'm not dead yet and I suspect that if they were actual heart attacks I'd be dead by now. They're certainly worrying, but a) I can't really get to the doctors because of the pandemic and b) I don't want to find out I have a heart condition in case it precludes me from entering my career of choice.",1
"Hey, I'm in the UK, I'm about ten years older than you but I have some experience with similar issues.

If you're worried that you're in an emergency situation with your symptoms, please do call an ambulance or get someone to take you to A&E. They will look after you. About three years ago I started getting horrible chest pains, sweating, dizziness. I was young and healthy and there were no risk factors. But I went to A&E because it was bloody terrifying. They couldn't find anything wrong, but said its good that I came because it's better safe than sorry with chest pain. This happened twice more, and I got diagnosed with costochondritis - but the important thing is, each time I was reassured that I did the right thing by going to the hospital. Yes, they don't like people wasting time, but by that they mean ""don't come in for a papercut"" - things you are genuinely worried about are 100% OK to go in with.",1
"I know many have commented about anxiety but I had a very similar thing happen when I was 16 and there were multiple times I was 100% convinced I was having a heart attack. Idk how many times my mom rushed me to the ER and the countless appointments we went to for everything to come back normal. Turns out it was anxiety, and I had no idea because I didn’t “feel” anxious at the time. 
Not saying what you’ve got going on IS anxiety, but just keep an open mind because even if you’re not feeling anxious or don’t think anything anxiety-inducing has happened, anxiety attacks can still get ya! 

Also, I was diagnosed with some sort of somatic personality disorder (I forget the name, just remember it had somatic in it, bc that was literally 15 years ago and after therapy I managed to “fix” it for the most part, although on rare occasions I’ll catch myself doing it) - when I get super emotional (whether it’s anger/sadness/fear) instead of “feeling” that emotion like most people do, I manifest it into physical symptoms. A lot of times I wouldn’t realize I was angry/upset/whatever, I’d just get the physical symptom and be like wtf is wrong with my body. 

It’s not unheard of to be young and have a heart condition, my brother had lots of chest pain/heart attack feelings and found out that while he does, in fact, have anxiety, he also has a valve issue that causes some of the chest pain. Just keep an open mind though, like I said, anxiety/other issues can still be a problem even if you don’t feel anxious/whatever emotion when it’s happening!",1
"Thanks, I notice I've been down voted a few times for saying I don't think it's anxiety but I really do appreciate all the input I'm getting. It's possible it's anxiety, as I've said I really don't know a lot about it so I'll have to do some research.

Yeah, I have a friend who had to have open heart surgery when he was about 12/13 for a valve issue that meant he fainted whenever he got too excited. I don't think it's necessarily something like that, but where I don't know a lot about anxiety I know even less about heart conditions. Considering I've been having this on and off for 2 years now, I don't know why I've never really looked into potential causes. At the end of the day, I think it's down to my somewhat cavalier approach to my health. If I'm not dying, it's not a problem, and if I am dying well it'll happen sooner or later so it's still not a massive problem in my eyes. Maybe a cynical approach, potentially even a worrying one if I'm honest, but I've never been too bothered about the idea of my own death.",1
"I had a heart attack at 28 caused by coronary artery spasm (prinzmetal’s angina). 
I had been feeling pretty bad on and off for 2 days, short of breath, felt exhausted, ‘tired’ feeling in my upper chest and left arm/shoulder. Like the muscle fatigue you feel if you’ve been using your arms above your head for too long. And lots palpitations. I was fine one minute and felt like I had been running a marathon the next, over and over.
Went to the GP twice those 2 days, but I was diagnosed with an anxiety attack and told I was hyperventilating. The evening of the second day it got worse, I was so very tired and my arm felt heavy, and I started getting nauseous. I was watching a movie with my BF, and at one point I told him I was feeling really bad and was going to bed. I got up from the couch, walked 3 steps and collapsed. He dialed the emergency services (I did wake up pretty soon and was able to walk back to the couch before they arrived), and when they arrived and hooked me up to a monitor I was told I was having a heart attack. 

I had no significant pain, more like a dull ache and tiredness, like muscle fatigue, left arm/shoulder and upper chest. The exhaustion was the worst, and I couldn’t walk two steps without getting winded and my heart beating out of my chest. And I knew something was VERY wrong.

I recovered fast and with no lasting damage by the way, and with medication it has not happened again. I was in good physical condition, and still am, and because I seemed fit, healthy and young the GP didn’t think it was something serious.",1
"Not me, but my mom had one at 45. We've talked a lot about it and what if felt like, for her. 

The first time she felt like something was wrong, we were having a huge fight. I said something shitty, and instead of reprimanding or even yelling back she just sat on the couch. She said she felt out of breath, and like her arms had just turned to lead. I wanted to call 911 but she was ADAMANT that she was fine. 

Fast forward a few weeks, she's been exhausted. She's missed so much work because she's ready to nap by 2pm, and needs to go home. She hasn't felt heavy and leaden since that night, but her chest and back felt really tight. After 3 weeks of feeling like this, she finally went to a hospital. Turns out she had a ""serious cardiac event"" and needed a stent put in. She was hospitalized for about a week. 

She said it never felt painful or sharp, and it didn't feel sudden like in movies. One day she was able to run up a flight of stairs and cook dinner, and the next day she needed to nap by 2pm and couldn't handle walking for 10 minutes without a rest. She thought she was either pregnant again or had mono. ",1
"I haven't had a heart attack, but since these stories are being shared I wanted to note the difference between cardiac arrest and a heart attack. My father had a heart attack without going into arrest and somehow this wasn't communicated to my brother or me so we didn't fully grasp what was happening, and I've since heard many people dismiss their symptoms because they don't match a movie scenario.

Below is an abbreviated version from the [American Heart Association](http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks/heart-attack-or-sudden-cardiac-arrest-how-are-they-different), but they have the full signs and symptoms of a heart attack or stroke on their website. As well as info on Hands-Only CPR. Hopefully okay to share here.

""People often use these terms interchangeably, but they are not synonyms. A heart attack is when blood flow to the heart is blocked, and sudden cardiac arrest is when the heart malfunctions and suddenly stops beating unexpectedly. A heart attack is a “circulation” problem and sudden cardiac arrest is an “electrical” problem.
 
Symptoms of a heart attack may be immediate and intense. More often, though, symptoms start slowly and persist for hours, days or weeks before a heart attack. Unlike with sudden cardiac arrest, the heart usually does not stop beating during a heart attack. The heart attack symptoms in women can be different than men.

Sudden cardiac arrest occurs suddenly and often without warning. It is triggered by an electrical malfunction in the heart that causes an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). With its pumping action disrupted, the heart cannot pump blood to the brain, lungs and other organs. Seconds later, a person loses consciousness and has no pulse. Death occurs within minutes if the victim does not receive treatment.""

"This question is SO IMPORTANT!!!! I haven’t, but in my life support class we learned it is a fact that heart attacks feel different for women than men. It’s not as widely known as it should be, but women need to know that a heart attack won’t feel/look like the classic signs. ",1
"I have not had a heart attack but I am a nurse who works in a hospital unit that deals with them on a regular basis :)

Just for clarification, as another Redditor pointed out, a ""heart attack"" is a term commonly applied to two different scenarios: a blockage in a coronary artery that causes heart muscle damage (myocardial infarction) OR when the heart isn't pumping blood properly and essentially stops (cardiac arrest), causing a person to essentially die unless someone helps (I.e. CPR +/- defibrillation). However, the two aren't necessarily exclusive - a myocardial infarction *can* cause a cardiac arrest if left untreated (though cardiac arrests aren't always caused by myocardial infarctions, and there are different types of cardiac arrests.....yeah, it's complicated lol).

So for this post, I'm going to assume ""heart attack"" to mean myocardial infarction, which is more common but harder to diagnose (because let's be real, if you go into cardiac arrest, you die, and that's not hard to miss).

The classic symptoms of a myocardial infarction are:

* Chest pain or pressure (often described as squeezing, like a band over the chest, or ""like an elephant sitting on the chest"")
* Pain radiating to the left arm and/or jaw
* Shortness of breath
* Nausea +/- vomiting
* Sweating
* Just generally feeling that something is very wrong

However, I've also seen lots of people say they had vague symptoms.

Most common of the subtle symptoms is the feeling of indigestion or heartburn. I can't count the amount of times I've heard the story of ""ate a big meal, went to bed, woke up with indigestion, took an antacid, and still felt like shit, continued to take antacids, and when I felt really unwell, went to the hospital."" The general rule of thumb I like to stick to is, if you're having heartburn and it won't go away with heartburn treatment, see a doctor. Even if it's ""just"" heartburn, you'll want to get it treated, anyway, because if left uncontrolled, it can damage your esophagus.

Other vague symptoms would be things like back pain, arm pain, nausea, intense fatigue, and dizziness. In fact, a couple of times, I've had patients who had no symptoms at all until we ran some tests on them; this is most common in people with diabetes.

While women are more likely to have the non-traditional signs and symptoms, men can have them, too, just like women can also have the classic signs. In fact, my first patient with a silent heart attack (no signs or symptoms) was a man!

So yeah, it's not very cut and dry but if you are ever concerned, please just call 911 (or whatever number you call for an ambulance) and get yourself to a hospital. Even if it turns out to be nothing, don't feel embarrassed or feel like you've wasted our time. We always take potential cardiac symptoms seriously because it's hard for us to tell, too, based on signs and symptoms alone, and the tests are fairly easy and quick. And  like a lot of other major ailments, it's best to get treated early rather than let it go on and on, potentially causing major damage.

Lastly, because I always get messaged, *please* no one ask me medical questions about you or a specific person. I cannot make assessments and give advice over the internet. If you have concerns about yourself or a loved one, please see a doctor in person.",1
"My mom had one last year and said it wasn't what men are known to experience at all. She had gone to bed and felt uneasy, said her heart started to ""smash and bang"" and generally felt anxious and unwell. She said she just knew something was wrong and suspected a heart attack, as they run in the family (she was the fourth of her siblings to have one within a three-year span) and my grandmother had died of one when I was a baby. My dad drove her to the hospital and it was confirmed she had a ""mild, non-stemi"" heart attack. Heart disease seems to be hitting the family younger and younger so my brother and I are probably at risk of developing it too. 

&#x200B;

For the record, my mom has never smoked, quit drinking and had good cholesterol. ",1
"“HNGGHHHH” - me, during my heart attack",1
"Which part exactly is false? My point was that [women are more likely to experience non-traditional/not-so-obvious signs and symptoms](http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/warning-signs-of-a-heart-attack/heart-attack-symptoms-in-women), but men can, too. The signs and symptoms are really variable across the board.

Quoted directly from the linked page from the American Heart Association:

>“Although men and women can experience chest pressure that feels like an elephant sitting across the chest, women can experience a heart attack without chest pressure, ” said Nieca Goldberg, M.D., medical director for the Joan H. Tisch Center for Women's Health at NYU’s Langone Medical Center and an American Heart Association volunteer. “Instead they may experience shortness of breath, pressure or pain in the lower chest or upper abdomen, dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting, upper back pressure or extreme fatigue.”

Or from the [Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.ca/heart/conditions/heart-attack):

>Women generally recognize the “Hollywood heart attack” with chest-clutching, crushing pain. If their pain is less severe, or if they have non-pain signs such as nausea, sudden fatigue or shortness of breath (signs more often reported by women), they are more likely to delay getting to emergency care, and once there, they are less likely to get fast, aggressive treatment.",1
"Not me, but I'm a nurse who works frequently with heart attack patients (for simplicity, I'm calling them heart attacks, when I mean ""myocardial infarctions"" - a blockage in one or more coronary arteries, causing heart muscle damage due to a lack of oxygen supplied by blood). The symptoms range from the very typical to really odd ones. I'd say the most common symptoms are pretty typical - a lot of chest pain (usually described as a ""heaviness"" like an elephant on the chest or a ""crushing"" or ""squeezing"", but people can have all sorts of different pains), often accompanied with symptoms like shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, and/or just generally feeling unwell and that something ""just isn't right"". Sometimes, the pain radiates to the jaw, the left arm, and/or the back, but I actually find it's less common than simply chest pain.

The most common vague symptom is definitely heartburn. Heartburn can mimic heart attacks and vice versa. I've seen people who thought they were having heartburn for days on end, when actually, they were having a heart attack (because it's not like on TV, where people suddenly clutch at their chests and keel over; such cases are usually the people who go into arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, which *can* be caused by heart attacks but not always). Usually, the key difference is the presence of other symptoms described above, but as I said, they're not always present. This is one of the reasons why it's important to get heartburn checked out if it doesn't respond to over-the-counter medications (the other side to it is that heartburn can actually do damage to your esophagus over time, so it's best to nip that in the bud in its early stages).

Lastly, I hope I don't scare anyone here, but there is also such a thing as ""silent heart attacks"", where a person is having a heart attack but there aren't any symptoms. It's more common in those with diabetes and the elderly. I once had a patient who was in hospital for a gangrenous toe (don't get diabetes, folks), and one morning, he was awake early and reading the newspaper, so I did a set of vital signs on him. To my surprise, his pulse was in the 140's (for reference, normal rate is 60-100, though we start to get worried around the 110-120 range). Called the doctor, who ordered some tests. The patient was totally calm, no pain or breathing difficulties (except for his sore toe). Turns out he was having a heart attack! He was treated for it and did fine, but sometimes I wonder what would have happened if he were sitting at home rather than in the hospital.

(**EDIT:** I am getting a few questions about the heart rate thing. I should add that heart rate alone is *not* an indicator of anything. It has to be taken in context. *Lots* of things can cause a high heart rate, from benign causes like anxiety or too much caffeine to more concerning things like a serious heart condition. One must take into consideration things like other vital signs, signs and symptoms, the patient's history, etc., to get even a decent clinical picture of what's going on. If a high heart rate can be explained, then it's not as big of a deal, either. For example, if a person is in respiratory distress, then they will have a heart rate because, well, they're struggling to breathe. As soon as you fix the respiratory issues, the heart rate should come down nicely. Also, the 110-120 range is still referring to a *resting* heart rate, and don't forget that I work in a hospital, often with patients who have co-morbidities that affect the heart's health and/or are elderly, who typically have lots of co-morbidities anyway. A young, healthy person may be able to tolerate a resting heart rate in the 110-120 range if, say, they get sick. An elderly person who has diabetes and heart disease? Yeah, not so much. A person who has just had a heart attack? Same. Their hearts just aren't able to work as hard as a young, healthy person's for prolonged periods of time. If you're young, healthy, and not sick or anxious or anything like that and your *resting* heart rate is elevated, then I wouldn't say it's a cause to panic, but you may want to get checked out by your family doctor - could be anything from anxiety to a malfunctioning thyroid to an actual problem with your heart. Again, go with your gut. If something feels *wrong* to you and you're that concerned about it, then talk to a doctor. I can't diagnose anything over the Internet...plus, I'm a nurse so I don't diagnose things in general!)

On the flip side, you can also have all the symptoms of a heart attack and even had things like electrocardiogram changes that suggest a heart attack, but in actuality, your coronary arteries don't have any blockages! (i.e. not a heart attack) An example would be [Takotsubo cardiomyopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takotsubo_cardiomyopathy) (a.k.a. Broken Heart Syndrome). I've looked after two patients with this diagnosis and it's really bizarre. Basically, the heart muscle will be injured, often due to stress (hence the name Broken Heart Syndrome - it's been known to happen after a person has lost a loved one), so we'll often see changes in the ECG, troponin level rise in the blood (often used to determine severity of a heart attack), and even indicators of heart failure. However, when an angiogram is done, there aren't any coronary artery blockages. The good news is that people generally do well after this, so long as they take care of themselves.

So basically, the heart is a very complicated organ and there is no real way to tell if there's something seriously wrong with it or not based on symptoms alone. As well, pain in the chest can be caused by so many different things, from anxiety to costocondritis to pulmonary emboli to heart attacks. Basically, if you have a concern about it, go see a doctor. Go with your gut and don't ignore symptoms that won't go away.

**LAST EDIT:** I'm getting lots of people asking me about their specific situations. As per Reddit policy (and because it's uncomfortable for me), I won't be giving medical advice to *anyone*. I can't evaluate anyone over the Internet. I'd merely be taking wild guesses, which isn't safe. If you have an actual concern about your health, please see a professional in real life, who can discuss things with you and do an examination.",1
"EMT here. I once treated a woman who was exhibiting all the classic signs of an anxiety attack, but we decided to do an EKG just in case because she was also feeling gassy. I'm glad we didn't just write her off as she requested because she was in a full-blown STEMI! Another time a family friend called me because she was just feeling a sense of doom and heaviness, like an elephant was sitting on her. I told her to call an ambulance just in case, and sure enough, it was a heart attack. 

Big ones to watch out for are difficulty breathing, feeling ""tight"" in the chest, weakness in both arms, or just feeling like something is really, really off. I always say air on the side of caution.",1
"This is an awesome question! Women have definitely been seen to have much different symptoms from men and it's so important to know about how cardiac episodes can present themselves for women vs. men.  Heart disease might not be the most popular or talked about cause, but heart disease and strokes are the cause of death of one out of every three women. 

I've been involved with the American Heart Association for years and they have a TON of resources but below are some pointers. Overall, all the survivors I've heard speak over the years typically say they experienced headaches and ""heaviness,"" but not the traditional arm tingling and crushing chest pain. It was much more subtle. 

Lastly, one of the big things we always try to hit home is it is so often that women are the last to raise their hand and recognize something is really wrong with them. We put others in front of us and think that it will just pass. One women told me she went the whole day, getting her sons to school, cooking dinner for her family, while she was suffering from a severe cardiac episode. She just didn't think it was serious enough to bother anyone with until she collapsed. 

**Signs of a Heart Attack**

- Uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain in the center of your chest. It lasts more than a few minutes, or goes away and comes back.

- Pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach.

- Shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort.

- Other signs such as breaking out in cold sweat, nausea or lightheadedness.

- Women are somewhat more likely than men to experience some of the other common symptoms, particular shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting and back or jaw pain.

**Signs of Stroke and TIAs (transient ischemic attack)**

- Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body.

- Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding.

- Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes.

- Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination.
- Sudden severe headache with no known cause.",1

I thought my arm was sore from carrying an 8 lb baby. the day of the baby's one week check up, I woke with cold sweat. i could breathe, but it felt like someone was sitting on my chest. went to the 9 am doc for the baby's appointment, and my husband told the receptionist that I was having chest pain. they rushed me to see a doctor right away and gave me aspirin.

What was unusual? I was working late shift and so I got up at around 10 AM. Yawned, walked slowly to the front door and picked up the paper. Took it into the kitchen to sit, drink coffee and read the paper. I was out of breath from that tiny amount of exercise. I rested several minutes until my breathing was normal and walked slowly to the front door (16 feet) and back. Arrived out of breath. Called a cab. No drama. Take me  to emerg please.

"My mother had throbbing jaw discomfort for months before she experienced full cardiac arrest.  She brought this up with her dentist and GP, but neither could find anything wrong.  About a month and a half before the heart attack, she had an EKG done to make sure she was clear to go on this big trip that she and my dad planned for overseas, and it showed no abnormalities.  She had also lost ~60 lbs over the previous 18 months in preparation for this trip, which involved a whole lot of walking.

The day or two before the heart attack, she experienced higher-than-usual fatigue and some heartburn (I think?), but nothing that was out of the ordinary for her, especially with the  leukemia drugs that she takes.  Then, at about 11:30 on a Tuesday night four years ago, she just dropped clinically dead on the kitchen floor with a full blockage of one of her arteries.

I was able to intervene almost immediately with CPR until the EMTs arrived and (eventually) successfully defibrilated her.  We've been very lucky that she's made a very substantial recovery.  While she has considerably diminished cardiac capacity, she did not suffer any other major organ damage and, while somewhat frail, she's a fully-functioning 55-year-old.",1
"Sorry this is long.

That last bit--Broken Heart Syndrome--I had something similar but no broken heart.  10 years ago, I was in law school, my dad died, and I was becoming hypothyroid (undiagnosed another years).  So *everything* was stressing, and my bp was good if it was under 145/100.  This was for over a year.

Having chest pains, I was sent to a cardiologist.  He asked me to describe my pain; I described six distinct types of pains: weight on chest, like a tight band; pain under the sternum; pain up to my jaw; sharp pains (like nails being pounded in) just left of center on my chest; dull aches that had me grabbing at my chest; and the worst one--lasting pain like someone shoved a pipe through my chest and it was coming out my back.  Oh, and though it's just an indicator of inflammation *somewhere*, a CRP over 20.  I'd had years of heartburn; an endoscopy showed NO esophageal issues.

The cardiologist's mouth literally dropped open on that last bit, husband said it was because that was ""classic heart attack"" and I said I'd felt it 8 or 9 times.  EKG was clear--they've always been just fine since, too.  First stress test was ""inconclusive.""  Two years later, the second one was, too.  I also had a massive x-ray, had to go to San Francisco for that--no *major* problem found, calcification somewhere between 0 and 50%, so not really helpful.  Oh, and an ultrasound, and some other test I can't remember.  All that was found found was that my heart was a bit larger than expected, but not unduly so, and no thickening of the walls.  I was told that I could ""buy green bananas""--I'd be alive to eat them when ripe, if you didn't figure that out.

Finished law school, got thyroid dosage right (that took a couple of years), and with that find, I passed the Bar the second time.  Stress down, as I was not working.  When I had pain suddenly, I insisted on an angiogram, based on that pain, my history, and family history (father had blockage but his body had made its own diversions around it).  

I had NO significant blockage of ANY kind.  At age 50, my arteries weren't perfect, but we're about as good as a 25yo.  NO damage to my heart muscle.  CRP still won't come down.

"No not necessarily. A high heart rate could be a result of many things. If it's not accompanied by chest pain or any other symptom of a heart attack, I'd think of other possibilities first. Also (almost - 2 months away) a nurse. 
If you have a high heart rate, start to get dizzy, short of breath, feel it pounding in your chest or fluttering, have chest, jaw, back or arm pain - that's when you should go to the ER. 

I personally have inappropriate sinus tachycardia, which basically means my heart rate is around 120 when I'm at rest. It's totally benign for me. ",1
"I should really put a note on that...

110-120 is in context, and I meant that as a *resting* heart rate. Heart rate alone *does not mean anything* and other things - like other vital signs, signs and symptoms, history, etc. - must be taken into consideration to interpret what a heart rate means in a clinical sense.

Your resting heart rate is about 80, which falls within normal range. Remember, I work in a hospital with ill patients, usually an older population (i.e. age 60+), and most patients I see aren't typically the healthiest of people (i.e. typically have at least one co-morbidity, such as smoking, diabetes, COPD, cardiac disease of some sort, etc.). Where I work specifically - cardiology - if the heart has already sustained damage because of, say, a heart attack, then we do try to keep the resting heart rate below 90. Anything higher means the heart must work harder, which is like making an injured person run a race.

If you're young, otherwise healthy, and have no symptoms, it's likely not too worrying. I've had young patients come in for things like infections or uncontrolled blood sugars (type 1 diabetics), and the doctors are fine with them having heart rates in the 120's because they're young and can compensate for that fast a rate (and there's an obvious explanation for it). A person in their 80's who has multiple co-morbidities? Yeah, their bodies just aren't as capable of compensating for as long.

Obviously, I can't diagnose anything over the Internet, but if your heart is beating fast with just ""any movement"" and you have no symptoms but is normal at rest, I'd hazard a guess that you may want to work on your cardio exercises if you aren't already? If you're physically fit, though, then I honestly have no idea and someone would have to actually evaluate you in person.",1

"Quick googling:

>Some digestive diseases, including Crohn's disease, affect more women than men. Up to six times more women than men have irritable bowel syndrome, a collection of symptoms that affect the large intestine. Women are likelier to have gallstones, due to the effects of progesterone and estrogen. For various reasons, women are likelier than men to use aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), and so are likelier to experience their harmful side-effects.


>With some exceptions, autoimmune diseases tend to affect one sex more than the other; specifically, far more women than men. For some time, physicians and researchers have been asking why this is so. The most popular theory to date has been that female hormones set the stage for diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis. 


>Graves Disease

>Recent studies put the incidence of Graves' disease at one to two cases per 1,000 population per year in England. It occurs much more frequently in women than in men. The disease frequently presents itself during early adolescence or begins gradually in adult women, often after childbirth, and is progressive until treatment. It has a powerful hereditary component.[3] Graves' disease tends to be more severe in men, even though it is rarer. It appears less likely to go into permanent remission and the eye disease tends to be more severe, but men are less likely to have large goitres.[65] In a statistical study of symptoms and signs of 184 thyrotoxic patients (52 men, 132 women), the male patients were somewhat older than the females, and cases were more severe among men than among women. Cardiac symptoms were more common in women, even though the men were older and more often had a severe form of the disease; palpitations and dyspnea were more common and severe in women.[3]

Not quite the same issues but ovarian cancer in the early stages can easily mimics other minor issues (symptoms: bloating, frequent urination, pressure/pain in the abdomen, changes in bowel habits, unexplained vaginal bleeding).

--------------------------------------------

But to lighten the mood, an anecdote for all my fellow hypochondriacs:

A few years back my mom was under quite a bit of stress. She started having intermittent chest pains and, very concerned, she went to the doctor ... turned out to be heartburn.",1
"Yes, I am aware. I am an EMT and every time we have any cardiac related con-ed we talk about this. 

I know there are disorders women are more or less likely than men to have. As far as the same disease manifesting differently though? All that comes to my sleep deprived mind is autism and ADD/ADHD, all of which tend to manifest differently in males and females. But they aren't really medical emergencies. ",1
"Actually, those symptoms are not really different from those of men. The article you linked had no information about the comparison of heart attack symptoms between men and women.",1
"It's 100% related to anxiety.  Not that I'm having panic attacks that *feel* like heart attacks, just that every time I feel something that is listed as a heart attack symptom I'm like, ""YUP IT MUST BE A HEART ATTACK""",1
"I've seen a lot of women having heart attacks and they have all displayed the typical ""classic"" heart attack signs and symptoms.  They describe crushing, squeezing, or heavy pain in the center of their chest, often shortness of breath, pain radiation to the jaw or L arm, and they have all had an intense sense of fear/impending doom.  

There is always the possibility of having an atypical presentation though, such as nausea which won't go away, ""not feeling right"", and abnormal weakness/fatigue.  These types of symptoms are more common in the elderly/diabetic community. 

If you have a strong history of heart disease in your family, you can ask your primary care doctor to refer you to a cardiologist so you can get a cardiac stress test (walking/running on a treadmill hooked up to an EKG).  The entire test takes about an hour and can help see if there's any signs that suggest heart disease.  ",1
"Do you see a cardiologist? I think that would be the best person to talk to about what symptoms you should pay attention to and what you can safely ignore.

My dad had a heart attack last summer. He had chest pain, and his dad died of a heart attack, so he went to the hospital. Lucky him, because he was in the hospital with a cardiologist present when he actually had the heart attack. They were able to act very quickly, and that's probably why he didn't suffer any permanent damage. He has recovered fully.

The moral of that story being, consult a professional and do not screw around.",1
"If you're worried about breast cancer or heart attacks then you'll need to keep a watch out for signs and signals. Grab a card from your doctor about how to give yourself a breast exam and hang it in the shower (Just a simple lump test). You can check every day, or once a week. Whatever makes you feel comfortable.

While classic heart attack symptoms do occur, studies directed towards women's health show that they may not be present at all with heart attack in women. It may be helpful to familiarize yourself with both sets of symptoms.

I wouldn't be afraid to talk with specialists in both areas to discuss what your options are for prevention, and what steps you need to take as you get older. My family has numerous breast cancer survivors and two members who suffered from heart attacks. It will definitely ease your mind to know as much as you can. ",1
My sister had a heart attack.  She didn't experience *any* symptoms other than blanching.  Luckily she was in the hospital at the time (visiting) and a nurse asked her if she felt alright and then they started doing the tests or whatever it is you do to diagnose a heart attack.,1
"What do you do? I did have an EKG and stress test done a few years ago (as well as an ultrasound of my heart). The EKG showed bradycardia. Stress test was fine. The mitral valve is allowing some blood to regurgitate which showed up on the ultrasound but the cardiologist wasn't concerned about it.

I keep reading that women have atypical symptoms so I was curious.",1
"I wish you the best and a complete recovery. And you know, it's never too late--as long as you're living--to take charge of your health. My mom didn't begin exercising and eating better until after her heart attack a couple years ago. Since then, she hired a trainer at a gym and went on a diet. She has dropped a LOT of weight and several sizes--she looks better than I ever remember! And she is 67.",1
"How old was your sister when she had the heart attack? I guess if you're gonna have one, it's better to already be in a hospital. Was she under a lot of stress at the time?",1
"That is really interesting about the sense of doom! That's not something I've ever seen listed under symptoms..

I have acid reflux and am used to my reflux, but a few years ago I had very unusual chest pain and began having a panic attack when it didn't go away. Went to the ER, they ran some tests to make sure I wasn't dying then sent me home with a dx of heartburn. 

I felt a little silly but better safe than sorry.",1
,
"It just sucks. I am a huge, huge aficionado of sudden death. It is the best way to go, especially before those downhill years kick in. Heart attack is preferable to stroke because it minimises the chances of surviving with brain damage. Again, women are cheated by biology.",1

How does it feel knowing you're much more likely to stay alive after a heart attack than women?",1

"It's one of the tradeoffs.  We're more likely to get depression, or more likely to have our heart attacks misdiagnosed.  I don't think about it much.",1
"In my family we have bad hearts and it is actually highly likely that i will die of a heart attack, just like my aunt, grandmother, and 2 of my great-grandmothers.   Since we all have to die, I would rather go out like that than with something shitty like cancer or dementia anyway, so bring on the heart attacks.",1

"I love these ""How do you feel"" questions.

Because they're never *actually* asking a genuine question we can answer. It's just a really really thinly veiled ""HEY, I'D LIKE TO PASSIVELY AGGRESSIVELY POINT SOMETHING OUT TO YOU."" move.",1
"I've lived with them for decades. I'm not sure there is a ""why""; some people just get them while others don't, like hives or a stutter. 

One of the best bits of advice I ever got came from a therapist who used cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to help me with the attacks: Once they start, you can ease the symptoms, but the chemical cocktail that creates that sensation of panic takes some time to metabolize out of your bloodstream. Just thinking of it as a purely physical phenomenon -- just like sweating during exercise or getting itchy eyes after dusting -- really helped a lot. 

Thinking of them in milder terms has also made a big difference: not ""this is unbearable"" but ""this is unpleasant,"" not ""I can't stand this"" to ""this will end soon and I'll just breathe my way through it until then."" Catastrophizing the attacks, I've found, really ramps them up in intensity. I no longer think of a long-lasting, intense attack as ""the worst"" or ""so bad"" but as...well, long-lasting and intense. Using those less emotionally charged words to describe the episode helps me step back from feeling the panic and more toward observing it, if that makes sense. 

I still get panic attacks, and they aren't ever fun, but they've become far more manageable by seeing them as a physical symptom of a weird little quirk of my brain chemistry. Other things that help: 

- Focusing on my breathing
- Playing some inconsequential word game in my head
- A change of scenery during the attack
- Recalling past attacks and realizing I didn't have a heart attack during any of those episodes either

"I used to get them several times daily, now only once or twice a month. It very much feels like a heart attack, or just ""impending doom/death"" in general. The best thing for me is acknowledging and accepting the panic attack, trying to fight it just makes it worse. And distraction and deep breaths also. During a panic attack we tend to hyperventilate which in turn worsens symptoms like pounding heart, rapid pulse and shortness of breath. It's a vicious cycle. ",1
"When I started suffering from panic attacks in my early 20s I literally thought I was going to have a heart attack and die. Went to the hospital a few times because I believed I was dying in fact. I read this book and a few like it and found educating myself about the symptoms to be an important first step in realizing I could take back control of my body. Like some have already said, breathing deeply and slowly is helpful to me, knowing that by slowing my breathing mindfully I am also slowing my heart rate naturally. Give it a few minutes of focusing on breathing slowly and nothing else and then check in with yourself to see how you feel. I haven't had a real panic attack in 5+ years and seldom even feel high anxiety. Good luck to you!

"Having someone talk me through it really helps. I begin to feel like I'm having a heart attack, hyperventilating, and like the world is ending. I do my best to focus on steadying my breathing and call someone up if I'm alone.

If I begin to feel one coming on I'll often leave my house and force myself to go out in public/into the most social situation I can bear. It is the thing that I least want to do in that moment but it really helps. Seeing other people going about their days like nothing is wrong really helps put my panic/anxiety into perspective and is very calming.",1

Buy this book and work through it.  Once you understand them, you can go about fighting them off better:

http://www.amazon.com/Panic-Attacks-Workbook-Program-Beating/dp/1569754152

Also, don't try to ""stop"" the panic attack - just be in the moment.  Say to yourself, ""I'm having a panic attack right now, but I'm not going to die or have a heart attack, plenty of people have these, and it's just my body thinking I need extra adrenaline, which I don't.""  Repeat this and believe it instead of trying to calm yourself down (which usually makes things worse).",1
"All you have to do is notice what is happening but don't attach any emotion to it, the same way you might notice what colour the car is across the street. 

Acknowledge that your heart is beating quickly, you know you can't die from it beating fast (after all you have had panic attacks before and you are still here) the heart is an amazingly strong and resilient organ. Also, I bet you couldn't make your heart beat faster even if you tried to.

Don't fight what is happening - that is the worst thing you can do, don't be impatient or try to force anything. Just accept it, think like you are floating above it, as though it wasn't really happening to you and let time pass. Before you know it the symptoms will have gone. That is the only way to break the anxiety > negative thoughts > adrenalin > increased anxiety cycle and it will help prevent it happening again in the first place.

"Ugh. I do. They've gotten very bad to the point where I've started taking anxiety medication for them. I still get them now because no medication is perfect. So now (and before I started on meds) to cope I focus on breathing and try to look at something that's not related to my trigger. I tell myself (in my head) that this is just a false reaction. I'm not going to die. It's not this bad and it will pass. If I feel panic coming on I'll pretty much do the same thing. I try and talk myself down by using plain blunt statements. Things like my brain is overreacting, I'm not in any real harm, in 5 minutes this will be all over, breathe in breathe out nice and slow. ",1
"I do.

Unfortunately my way of dealing with them probably won't help you because I don't get the heart attack sensation. For me, lying down on the floor or grown until my vision and strength in my extremities returns usually helps. If I'm in a situation where that's not socially acceptable I usually have to excuse myself to the bathroom to throw up. Or throw up in public.",1
"I've gotten a couple, but they've never been too bad (luckily).  Deep breaths are really a good start, they're cliche for a reason.  I tell myself things like ""This is a panic attack.  Nothing is wrong with you, you're just freaking out,"" because they can be scary and make me think that there is physically something wrong.  Reminding yourself that you're not dying, you're just panicking, is good.  Trying to concentrate on something that isn't the source of your panic helps.  During my last one, I got in the shower (not smart if you think you're going to pass out, but I've never had that happen) and started focusing really hard on getting the tangles out of my hair and getting clean.

You need to find out what the key signs are for when you start to get them, and try ro position yourself in a way to prevent them as best possible (as my clinical psychologist told me). However, everything works differently depending on the person. I'd consider seeking professional help to see what could work best for you. For me, focusing on taking slower and deeper breaths helps the pain a bit. I wish you all the best, and hope you find what you need!",1

Mine come on without warning.  I don't have to be thinking about anything stressful or even feeling really stressed, when suddenly my heart starts to pump like crazy and it gets hard to breathe.  It happens a lot when I'm at work, and I'll usually just go ""hang on"" and sit down until it passes so I don't get lightheaded.",1
"Exactly! I also found it beneficial to go to the ER during an attack. They tested my heart and gave me the all clear. Hearing a doctor say my heart was fine, and it was just a panic attack eased my mind so much. I still hate the attacks and they are still a bit scary, but it helps to be able to remind myself that the doctor said I'm physically healthy and at basically no risk of heart attack at my age with no other risk factors.

"I have to lay down, breathe, and just hope I don’t pass out. It helps when someone is there to monitor me because my heart rate goes too fast and I can hear my heart pound. I get extremely dizzy and feel as if I’m going to pass out. It can last 15 min to cycling through 8 hours.

Mine are more likely to happen if I don’t sleep well (like 2-4 hours) and haven’t eaten. So I try to get better sleep and nibble on something. I also try and avoid caffeine as much as possible.

One of my fav fun facts: Your body uses cholesterol to make bile (among other things), bile helps you digest fats, once your digested food and bile enter your intestines your body can absorb and recycle the bile for future use - BUT - if you eat a lot of fiber it get's trapped in you stool and gets eliminated. Then your gall bladder demands more cholesterol from your body and obtains it from your blood serum. Then blood serum levels of cholesterol go down. This is how eating OLD FASHIONED oats helps you reduce your cholesterol.

"> I only have my period once every 3 months and the only reason I do is to make sure I'm not pregnant.

It can take a while for your period to settle down after stopping the pill, so don't worry if it doesn't return to normal right away.  Also, the first bleed is likely the withdrawal bleed, your body doesn't know if you've stopped altogether or just for the week.  Additionally, being on the pill shouldn't affect the result of a pregnancy test, so it's fine to just do the old pee-on-the-stick.

The advice from RememberYourPass refers to the combined pill, the mini-pill (progesterone only pill) is taken every day without breaks, and your period can remain normal, stop altogether, or anything in between.  Other methods can have different effects.

All things considered though, what every woman should know about contraception is: don't be afraid to ask your doctor (or whoever is prescribing) as many questions as you want about your contraceptive choices, including side effects, efficacy, method of action, effect on your period, and anything else that pops into your head.  There are no stupid questions.  The combined pill is most common, but far from the only option.  If you're not happy, go back and discuss it again.  If you don't think your doctor is listening to you, see somebody else.  Don't go without birth control just because the first method you tried didn't work out for you.",1

If you have aspirin at home, take a 325mg dose (if it's baby aspirin, take 4. they're about 81mg each.) if you can, feel your pulse, see if it's regular or irregular, weak or strong.

"I see it a lot working in a male-dominated field. But the worst I've seen lately actually happened at the repair shop a few weeks ago. I've been driving my car for 13 years - it's great to have a car that long because you really learn the ins and outs of it, exactly what it can and can't do (maneuverability), and all the little quirks and sounds it makes. I've done a lot of my own work on it - replaced the whole tail light, replacing headlights, even replaced the window motor and regulator on the passenger side. Nothing engine related though. So basically, it's my baby. So a car has a lot of bushings. When bushings wear out, your car will start to squeak when you go over bumps (sounds a lot like a creaky bed during sex LOL). I took it in for a full inspection of the suspension and explained the sounds I was hearing. Once it was ready to pick up, my boyfriend (of 4 years) came in with me ... and the mechanic (male) only talked to my boyfriend. Things like that are irritating af. Basically, in terms of *my car*, this mechanic chose to talk to an amateur instead of the professional. ",1

We're more than 50% of the population, but okay.",1

"Because general health historically covers mens health extensively. Women's health has always been ""ghettoized"" (ie: the heart attack symptoms that women face are considered ""atypical"" by the medical community, even though women make up a little more than half the population) and there have been recent steps to improve it.

We also have to see a special doctor if it's a vagina related issue.",1

Yeah, I think he does enjoy hangining out with me, it's just weird because we fell into such a routine of cuddles and kisses and hugs and whatnot. He has told me recently in passing he still loves and cares for me, while he may not be IN love with me, he loves me. He still cares a lot though, I can see it on his face, and it sorta pains him as much as he likes hanging out with me, to do so.
Yeah, I think we do need space, I mean he's going away on friday back interstate until Jan so that should help him I suppose... 
I'm not sure really how to go from here really. I'm a bit confused, because I love and care for him still, and he's really a lovely and amazing person.

"When they don’t listen. I have the ability to check my doctors’ write up after a visit, I use that to determine how well they are listening. I have several conditions which interact with each other in many ways so it is important to have a doctor who is at least knowledgeable of the strangeness my presentations incur. I have EDS, temporal lobe epilepsy, chronic orthostatic hypotension and symptomatic PVC’s and bouts of SVTs.

For example, I had a cardiologist (it was actually my second too) where I was discussing my experiencing supraventricular tachycardia and orthostatic tachycardia. I have my degree in exercise physiology and worked in cardiac rehab where it was my job to recognize certain rhythms. So anyways these are two very different rhythms, SVT is generally produced by atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia where the supraventricular node (below the normal firing node) begins firing rapidly at a rate of over 200bpm. This results in the electrical ‘spark’ of the heart coming from the center of the heart rather than above the right atria so there are very obvious EKG changes when this occurs that can be seen even on an Apple Watch Telemetry. It also generally lasts only about 60 seconds before normal sinus rhythm is reattained and you’ll see a space in the telemetry where you skip a beat before abruptly going from 200+bpm to whatever it was before.

Orthostatic tachycardia on the other hand is normal sinus rhythm but is unusually fast, generally just 100+bpm at rest and may present with extreme raises upon standing or moving. It can last a really long time, generally for me I’ll experience it for an hour or more, there is no clear cut begin or end for this, tends to come on gradually and leave the same way.

So I experience both of these individually and at different times/triggers. SVT occurs when I’m working out generally after an impactful movement (ie. Box jumps, fast squats) while OT can occur fairly randomly.

So I explained both of these to the doctor and he kept interrupting me going back and forth between the two and I could see he was getting mixed up and not really paying attention and wouldn’t even look at the Apple telemetry I had. He ultimately told me there was nothing he could do and that there were no cardiologists in the clinic I went to that treated EDS related cardiac issues. We’re talking a chain of over 6 locations so I found this highly skeptical.

When I reviewed his notes I found that he hadn’t separated the two conditions and instead reported that I experienced sinus tachycardia of 100+ bpm for a minute at a time upon standing. Which was not at all what I’d described. I sent a message to my current overseeing doctor pointing out the blatant errors in their reporting and she helped me get transferred to another cardiologist who was faaaar more helpful and thorough in their approach. 

He was the one who ended up diagnosing me with orthostatic hypotension and this was after 2 other cardiologists had just written off my symptoms. honestly I’m not sure why it hadn’t occurred to me because I’ve always had low BP but that’s why even other medical professionals work with doctors. He also helped me coordinate different lifestyle changes and now I’m managing it without even using medication. Although now I get to call coffee my medication (hehe). 

He also was open to discussing getting a cardiac ablation at some point to help the PVCs and SVT that I get. Something that no doctor has brought up, probably because I’m only 28 and I’ve found many doctors are highly resistant to admitting when young people have medical issues.

I also had my focal seizures ignored for four years with doctors telling me they were ‘weird panic attacks’ up until I hallucinated and had an extreme postictal state where I basically lost consciousness. Scared the shit out of my husband. Really pissed me off that my neurologist was immediately like, these sound like temporal lobe seizures. We need to run a full seizure panel, you may need to have an EMU stay, etc. and here I’d been dealing with these for years and thinking I was just really resistant to anxiety medication. Enough said, I don’t work with that doctor who insisted they were panic attacks anymore.",1

I seem to be significantly less emotional than most of my peers. I see all things rationally, I think that limits my ability to be romantic. I also work in health care where part of my job is attending all cardiac arrests and shutting down the life support. I see people die all the time, a lot. Apparently I am well suited to this line of work because even as a student it never really bugged me, while a lot of my classmates recall stories of driving home from a shift in tears because of a death they saw. 

This has never affected my ability to be compassionate, and I always do my best to give my patients the utmost care. But when they die I find myself feeling like that's just the way life goes. I see the chain of events that lead to it, I understand the medical reasons for it. I feel bad for the family's grieving process and how it will affect their lives moving forward. 

Its not a matter of me not understanding emotion. I can be very empathetic. I'm just not very sympathetic, perhaps. Life happens the way it happens. It doesn't always occur positively, but when it happens negatively I don't find myself very bothered.

Edit: Optimists downvoting me, perhaps? What if I told you all health care workers joke around during cardiac arrests, we aren't sobbing about it. If you deal with death day in and day out you stop caring so much.",1
"**Wall of text, sorry... but I believe I covered most things**

It's pretty standard to do an abdominal examination on top of a respiratory and cardiac examination when examining patients. Putting the stethoscope down around the abdomen gives one an idea as to whether or not the bowels are moving, which is a sign of bowel health. Bowel sounds aren't always heard right off the bat, so sometimes one has to move the stethoscope around (the recommendation is to listen for up to 1-5minutes depending on the resource... but nobody ever has that much time). A proper abdominal examination has to expose the area up until slightly above the pelvic region.

Some materials are harder to listen through, and it's not so much the thickness of it every time. I find it easy enough to listen through say something like cotton, but through some swishy fabrics and the like, I can't hear jack shit, and will require access underneath it. Occasionally, the bra/breasts can interfere with a cardiac exam, if they're too big, which in turn prevents the stethoscope from being placed in the appropriate areas. 

Him calling in the nurse was supposed for legal purposes; she's there to attest to the fact that everything he did was a part of a normal medical examination, and that there was no funny business going on. You'd be surprised how damaging a false accusation can be, and as a result, many doctors now are a bit apprehensive. Many robes are designed to open up at the back actually, and are supposed to be put with the un-opened end at the front, and the slit/opening at the back... kind of like putting on a coat on backwards; the typical blue/white ones that you see in many north american hospitals are designed as such. It sounds to me like you might have put it on backwards.

He came from behind so that he'd have an easier time listening to the lungs. It's personal preference whether one listens to the lungs from the back or front, but the heart sounds can make listening from the front a bit harder, so many like to listen from the back, then go back to the front for the cardiac and abdominal exam. It has nothing to do with looking at your panties. 

There are lots of sounds that one can check for/make sure is normal in the abdomen, including the flow of blood to your kidneys, the aorta down there, and the like. He's technically not listening to your heart over there, but there are parts of a typical cardiac exam that are performed outside of what the general public associates with the heart (i.e. outside of the immediate chest). It was likely done as part of a global examination. 

The wires that they stick to the body... does the term EKG or ECG sound familiar? Or Heart Exam? He might have heard an incidental sound when listening to the heart, and ordered an ECG (which is an electrical tracing of the heart, as the electricity surges through various aspects of it) to see if he could pick up an abnormality. As a clinician, while it's nice to get the report from the technician who does it, some of us like to see the ECG tracing itself to verify. Yes it has to be topless, because the wires cross all over the chest... it's measuring electric currents across the heart, which incidentally happens to be placed in the chest. Putting things on top of the wires, moving around during the read, or even crossing wires in some shittier machines, can cause artefacts which ruin the ""image""/result. Judging by the fact that he asked for her to bring it back to him, suggests that he's sending your sister away to do it... which is consistent with normal medical practice. He's having a technician do it. If he wanted to molest your sister, you'd think he'd want to do it himself so that he would have more opportunities to access your sister's chest, no?

Sometimes it's easier to just tell patients that you're listening to something else than what you are actually listening for, so that they don't get confused. They don't have the training or knowledge to understand why a sound in the abdomen can be related to the heart, so to make things easier, some people just say ""heart sounds"" etc., as a general encompassing term. If I said ""oh, I'm just going to check to see if you have a triple A or dissection,"" you'd probably be confused, so it would make both our lives easier if I just said ""I'm going to listen for a heart sound or aorta sound down here."" The confusion behind what he was doing can lead to misunderstanding; in the future, if you feel uncomfortable, just ask them what they are listening/checking for, and they can explain to you in better detail. 

Multiple patients in the room, technically shouldn't be done, but often is given time constraints and practicality. Depending on how important it is to get a clear sound on that particular organ, one may choose to just cursory listen over the clothes, or may feel the need to get firm contact between the stethoscope and skin (the sound improves significantly in some cases). If for example, you come in with something I believe is clearly abdominal in origin, I might give your heart and lungs a cursory listen just to make sure nothing big is going on there...and for that I probably would just quickly do it over the clothes, barring any thick/undesirable fabric. If he stayed in the room while you were undressing, he was probably just in a rush to get the exam over with so he could see the next patient, filling out paper work, or a variety of other things. As to gloves, if it's just to do a superficial exam (i.e. I don't have to stick any fingers into any orifices, you aren't bleeding/oozing fluids, and there aren't any lesions/infections on the skin), some people may just wash their hands and go at it (it's a preference thing, as gloves reduce tactile sensation and can get in the way of things). The filthier it is, the more likely most doctors are to put on gloves (to protect both you and them). 

Since it was your first time at this clinic, it was likely that he was trying to do a baseline of all your organ systems, so that in the event that something new happens (i.e. Oh no, my chest hurts... and he examines it and hears a new sound in there that based on a previous exam wasn't there, he has a pretty good idea that something pretty big might have happened) he has something to compare to. Follow up appointments are nice, because they're usually faster as one can pretty much just verify ""no change"" occurred in non-involved organs. 

Based on what you described, it honestly doesn't sound like anything inappropriate occurred. If anything, it was most likely a miscommunication. If you feel strongly about it though, you can always lodge a complaint against him, though if based on his previous history and performance it appears unlikely that he did anything, it likely will be acknowledged and thrown out. You'd be surprised how often doctors get accused of something malicious, when in reality it was standard practice or a procedure that was just poorly communicated. Busy physicians unfortunately do not take the time to explain to patients what they are going to do, which can be confusing and alarming to patients, when simple reassurance is all that's needed.",1
"I produce struvite stones and my diet has no affect on them as they’re infection related. I’m on a nightly low-dose antibiotic but that’s to try to prevent any more big kidney infections. 

I have to go in every 3 months for my stent to be changed (my ureter has collapsed a number of times and the stent keeps it open) as I produce stone around the stent and if it’s left in too long, it’s impossible to remove (they know this because they detached my ureter resulting in emergency surgery to reattach it), and also for scans and x-rays to check the progress of my stones.

"Nope. They aren't nutritious enough to be worth it to me (SUPER high in cholesterol); also hens will often eat their own unfertilized eggs to replenish the nutrients lost from laying them so I would prefer to just let my hypothetical chickens do their thang with their own bodily secretions.

See [newyeornewme's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/6n4van/vegan_women_if_you_raised_your_own_backyard/dk8cfvo/) for info. Perhaps genetics have more to do with cholesterol, but that does not mean that the food you eat has no effect on it. It stands to reason that someone who avoids eating too much cholesterol likely has healthier levels than someone who doesn't, if they're coming from the same genetic risk. I *personally* don't find them nutritious enough to be worth eating because I just generally don't favor eating the bodily secretions of other animals. How this is controversial when all I did was answer the question I guess I don't understand.",1
"Why is it a problem that eggs have cholesterol given they do not impact negatively on your blood cholesterol levels (actually most research shows they lower LDL and raise HDL)?

They also have protein, unsaturated + omega-3 fat, multiple vitamins and minerals. I get that people don't like eggs from an ethics point of view but to say they are not very nutritious is factually incorrect. ",1
"While I understand that there are many good reasons not to eat eggs, your body needs the type of cholesterol that is found in eggs. I hope you aren't avoiding it entirely.",1
"We've known for years now that genetics, not diet, is the driving force behind blood cholesterol levels. Also, eggs are [extremely nutritious](http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/good-eggs-for-nutrition-theyre-hard-to-beat#1). ",1
"Total bs, the claim that fat and cholesterol are bad for you is flat wrong.",1
Cholesterol is required to build every single cell in your body. It's not something to be avoided.,1
"Yep. Our brains are made of cholesterol. Our organs have a protective layering of fat around them to protect them. Our muscles have intramuscular fat that is used as an energy store. 

We need fat and cholesterol. ",1
"The idea of ""good"" cholesterol is misleading. That is the animal based cholesterol that many people have too much of, but it is still necessary. What you want is a good HDL and LDL ratio.",1
Exactly. Especially for vegans and vegetarians who are not getting too much cholesterol from animal sources like many people on the SAD.,1
"I won't get into the affiliations of the editorial board in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (wherein this study was published), but that article itself even says ""The study also suggests that the overall health effects of foods are difficult to anticipate based on an individual nutrient such as cholesterol alone.""

As I stated in my original comment, eggs are not nutritious enough for me to want to eat in that they are secretions from an animal, and when I sat down and considered this, I found it to be pretty gross. The potential health benefits, for *me*, do not outweigh the gross-out factor.",1
"No particular cheese, but that port salut sounds delicious! Unfortunately, I'm on a self-imposed cheese ban for a while, since my cholesterol levels were on the high side last time I had it checked, and I'm trying to avoid too much saturated fat :( Mmm, cheese...",1
"Port Salut is like, the most amazing cheese. I never buy a whole wheel of it otherwise I would eat the whole thing in one sitting. I have to make do with a wedge of it every few months left lest I succumb to cheese-induced cholesterol. ",1
"So it looks like the latest science indicates that saturated fat/cholestrol in the diet may have little to no bearing on blood cholesterol - that was a myth started in the early 80s by a cardiologist (because it does make sense), and they think that the low-fat movement it spawned us what is behind the obesity epidemic now. 

The thinking now is that the culprit is sugar. I can say anecdotally that when I excised sugar (added and natural) from my diet, and upped my fat intake (including eggs and cheese and bacon), my triglycerides fell by half in a couple months. Good cholesterol went up and bad cholesterol went way down, making my ratio better.  (Side benefit - weight loss!)

Just some food for thought. Cutting sugar is hard...but you do get to eat cheese!  ",1
"dietary fiber. It gives your poops good structure and traps your bile in your stool. Your body can use your lower intestine to retrieve your bile to recycle it. Cholesterol is used in producing bile. If you eliminate your bile with your stool you create a good demand for cholesterol that you consume in eggs and cheese burgers. Because you'll have to produce more bile replaced the amount you eliminated. This is how diets high in dietary fiber helps lower blood serum cholesterol levels.

"Be aware that people heal differently. I found out from getting Microblading and line-work in a tattoo that my skin just won't hold a fine line. Both became a little blurry and thicker even though both were done by very experienced professionals. 

My eyebrows had perfect strokes that matches the hair exactly when they were done. I followed aftercare exactly, but they lost that hair stroke look and now look more like makeup or tattooed. They also haven't faded at all, which I have mixed feelings about. [These photos](https://imgur.com/a/bvaPitG) are over two years apart. 

Last thing is to be sure you know exactly how close together you want them. Strokes can be added in the touch up but not taken away. I was so focused on the shape and I thought there was a standard of going straight up from the inner eye, nope. My brows are in line with current beauty standards, but closer together than I prefer and they also are more permanent than I originally expected.",1

From all the pictures of the work she had done I always liked the look of those the most. It’s sort of the best of both worlds as there’s strokes to mimic the look of individual brow hairs and the tattoo part sort of filled in around the micro blading and my natural brows.,1
"Yeah, mine weren’t cheap either. The first time, I paid about $450 and the second time I used a Groupon and paid $300. It maybe lasted about 7-8 weeks before I had to start filling in again. I spend about about $200 a year on Anastasia eyebrow pencils and it takes about 5 minutes or so to do my brows. So, I’m just filling in my brows again. I want to do something more permanent but not sure what. 
You will probably like how it looks because the tech will out line your brow and mark the strokes in the brow. The hardest part is it won’t last a year.",1

"For some, like myself, hormones have a huge affect on migraines. Which is why it's common to get one around the time of your period.

Last year, my hormones were totally out of whack. I was acting like a psychopath and my migraines have never been worse. It got to the point where I was experiencing confusion, I couldnt form basic sentences and I forgot very simple words that we say often. Like ""where"" or ""about"". 

A whole year went by before I figured out what was happening. It turned out that I had an extremely serious issue in my body that was making my hormone levels fluctuate like crazy. Once I had surgery, my hormones went back to normal over time and my migraines decreased significantly.

I'm pretty sure estrogen has a lot to do with pain receptors in the brain (hence the stroke-like symptoms I was experiencing) which is why some BC is too risky. But I could be wrong. 

The body is so wild. People don't pay enough attention to their hormones and they should. They're indicators when something isn't right.",1

"I had a medication that gave me ocular migraines as a side effect. Pepcid of all things. It's a really common otc med and apparently I'm like one in a million, but there we are.

[This is the best visualization I've seen of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8P_ZTJqv8g) it's pretty spot on though mine took up a much larger field of view after about half an hour and lasted for a really long time. A few hours at least. 

Terrifying the first few times it happened- wasn't able to drive home. Had to have someone pick me up from work. After a couple times they got kind of entertaining. I never had pain or nausea associated with it though I have gotten other migraines for years that certainly do- just no visuals. So I'd be at work and be like ""it's starting again"" and kinda play with my blind spot until someone picked me up to go home (I could not work without being able to see and it would last several hours). They stopped a few days after I stopped taking pepcid. Haven't gotten em since. 

I really feel for people who have them on a regular basis. It's no joke. I was effectively blind. Combine that with the common pain symptoms after and fuck that noise. Either is shit enough on it's own. Both is just the universe poopin' on your face. ",1
"Only once. It was my worst one to date. I didn't realize it was an aura at the time. It was like there was a white spot in my right eye that wouldn't go away. I thought it was just my eyes or brain bugging out because I was in a white room looking at white papers at the time. Then the pain started. I eventually drove myself home, threw up from the nausea, and laid in bed crying from the pain until I was finally able to pass out.",1
"I lose vision in my peripherals and if I don't take some Advil extra strength asap, I will get  nauseous and likely pass out. I don't ever get any other symptoms of a migraine because it goes straight from aura to passing out. Usually caused by low blood pressure because I forgot to eat, or staring at a screen too long (both go hand in hand for me since I work at a computer and often forget to eat while doing so).",1
"Yeah for me migraine is usually just the aura, with a bit of a headache.

Sometimes my first sign will be that I am squinting and straining to see my work in a way I usually don’t. 

Then it will start as a little blurry patch with distorted colours, that looks a bit like when you get a drop of water on your phone screen. This gradually expands and slides down my vision. Eventually a good portion of my vision will be obscured. 

I can get around but not see details. Trying too hard to focus and get stuff done during this time can start/worsen a headache and sometimes make me feel a little nauseous. It’s a real nuisance.

Takes about 2 hours from first hint of blurryness to it passing.",1
"I had this only one time, when I was pregnant. I had no idea what was going on. I just had this spot in my vision that was very persistent and wouldn't go away. I know this sounds crazy, but I was starting to think someone had slipped me acid in my food or something and I was starting to get really bad anxiety about it. Then the headache hit and I did some googling and realized it was just a migraine. It has never happened since, but wow that was a weird and horrible experience.",1
"I've had three aura migraines in my life. They were by far the worst I've ever felt. I realised the trigger was dehydration and running on a hot day (all were shortly after track practice ended in the summer) so I just drank more water.

When the aura first starts it just seems like a spot in my vision, primarily on my right side. I could still see it with my left eye if I covered up my right, and things behind it were able to be seen, but not clearly. Like when you glance at a bright light for a moment and for the next few seconds you have a blind spot in your vision. But the spot grew bigger and bigger over time and seemed to look like static on a television if I concentrated on it, and formed a backwards C. Eventually the C would grow bigger and bigger until I couldn't see it anymore, as if it had passed by me of it were physically real. Once it disappeared from my vision, the migraine hit. I had intense pain from my neck to my forehead, pounding, throbbing and sharp. I felt dizzy, nauseous and weak. Once I saw the aura I had about 40 minutes to get to an appropriate place for the migraine to hit, and all I could really do was wait it out.

It sucked so hard. And when I figured out I just had to drink more water I smacked myself in the forehead like ""could I be so stupid? That's it?"" Thank God that was it.  ",1
"Yes, since the age of 13. Mine start with a dot like you get after a camera flash, then slowly go from one side of my eyes to the other. At first, it’s small, then it gets bigger with each pass and it is shaped like a zig-zagged greater than/less than sign. Where ever it is, I can’t see, so I have a blind spot- it can last from 15 minutes up to an hour depending on circumstances. When they get to their largest and disappear, most times that’s when the pain hits, like a sledgehammer- I’ve had it knock me to my knees and start throwing up wherever I’m standing. 

On the worst ones, my arm and face tingle and go numb and I slur my words or I think correctly but what I say doesn’t come out right. 

Now they call them hemiplegic migraines. 

When I was 22, I had a full on stroke due to taking birth control pills and the severity of my migraines. I lost the use of my right side and had to do a lot of therapy to get it back and speak again. 

I tell everyone I know to not take birth control if they have migraines.

 Barometric pressure is a big one for me, stress, msg and I am very light, sound and smell sensitive. I use a thing called f.lux on my comp to adjust the light because I can see the fluctuations on the white patterns and it drives me batty. I put it to “candlelight” on all times so I don’t have the brightness to deal with.",1
"I get them a lot. 

I get light sensitivity and an absent ringing in my ears (like the sensation of ringing, but without the sound... it’s hard to explain). Then it starts with slight pressure, like I tied a ponytail too tight. Then it escalates to a full on headache then a migraine. 

My migraines are scary though. The worst has stroke-like symptoms. They thought I might be having TIAs but that got ruled out. I get vision problems, tingling on one side, speech problems (though it’s due to the pain and I can fight through it if I try), all while having the actual migraine headache. ",1
"Yes, I've gotten them periodically throughout my life since childhood. 

I get something called a [scintillating scotoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillating_scotoma) that completely obstructs a good portion of my vision to the point where I can't see certain things. It's like having an obstructive object in my way and can't see the things behind it. You know that bright light you get in your eyes when you look at the sun for too long, but it eventually goes away? It's like that, but it doesn't diminish after a minute or two...it stays for the duration of the migraine. 

I also get pretty bad expressive aphasia. When I was 8, I remember my mom taking me to the ER for these migraines (she thought I was having a stroke...which they present similarly to), and my mom kept asking me all kinds of questions and wouldn't leave me alone. Instead of wanting to communicate to her, ""Mom, can you please be quiet"" the words that came out of my mouth were, ""Mom, why are you so bald?"". I had the thought in my head that I wanted to say, however completely different message comes out. It's a very frustrating and powerless feeling tbh. Sometimes it gets as bad as a jumbled up word salad. [This]( https://youtu.be/AVKDm4PhEwI) is actually a perfect example of what happens to me. 


The next strange symptom I get is this approximately 2x2 square patch of numbness that arises at my finger tips of one hand, and slowly rises up my arm (but only in the 2x2 patch..I regain sensation again to the places where the square patch started out after it migrates upward) until it hits that shoulder of the arm it started out on. Then, it will cross over to the opposite shoulder and make its way down to my fingertips, to which it stops completely once it's there. Very weird shit. 

Lastly, and probably the weirdest thing for people to understand, is that I don't get a headache with my migraines...like, at all. No nausea either. 

They're debilitating for me though, because I can't function properly even though they don't cause me pain. I can't communicate, see, and am generally not pleasant to be around when I have one. I'm lucky that if I catch it when it's starting early some extra strength advil is enough to stop it in its tracks. However, if I wait till it progresses I'm screwed and am completely useless for like 6 hours until it goes away on its own. I hate them, because they've stopped me from being able to safely take estrogen based oral contraceptives (which is like 99% of them). Thank goodness they're not very common for me though...*knocks on wood*.

Edit: Another common term for my type of migraine with aura is a hemiplegic migraine. ",1
"Yes. It wasn't painful until the aura went away, then it was nausea and the worst pain with no way to stop it. This happened 2 times a week and went on for months. I finally told my Dr who realized I was having a bad reaction to the BC pill Azurette. She pulled me of it right away because this aura migraines were a sign I would soon have a stroke. The migraines stopped as soon as I stopped taking the pills. ",1
"This is why estrogen based oral contraceptives are black box contraindicated. If you've had an aura migraine, even once, and take estrogen based birth control then your chances of having a stroke from the birth control (normally an incredibly rare side effect) hike up quite a bit.",1
"Yes, it's truly horrible. I commend you for staying calm and just googling, I ran straight to the doctor in horror. I had some other symptoms though, like a stroke.",1
"I'm sorry you had to experience this. Have you recovered completely? I read online that migraines with aura are connected to a higher risk for strokes. I think it's great that you warn others of the dangers of the pill. It's important that more women know that the pill is not harmless as it's made out to be. 

I use f.lux as well, it's much better on the eyes.",1
"They are terrifying. I mentioned it to my eye doctor and he immediately said that all his patients said how horrible it was. If you don't know what's happening, it's like a stroke.

Interesting, I never had any symptoms before I got my migraine attacks. They were caused by the pill, so they only ever came about during the one week when I stopped taking them. Maybe that's why I didn't have symptoms before. I had only two migraines with aura so far, all the other ones were ""just"" headache migraines.

Yes, headaches are a very nasty kind of pain. ",1
"I never heard of such a reaction to peanuts, but it doesn't seem that unlikely to me. 

Did you know that there is a theory that peanut allergies are actually a reaction to a very high amount of aflatoxines (mold) that is present in bad peanuts? It's a bit obscure and I only read it in passing, but I found it interesting.",1
It was weekly when I switched to Sprintec. Looked up symptoms online. Saw the word “stroke.” Panicked and called my doctor. My cousin had a stroke at 25 and they believe it was her birth control. Not happening to me.,1
"It really is. The only way I can get rid of them is to lie down in a dark, quiet room and pass out for a little while. OTC pain medications don't even touch it. Luckily I don't get them that often anymore.",1
"Yes, that's also what my family said. I went to the doctor the same day I had it and he immediately sent me to the hospital. Well, a stroke at 25 is extremely early, that's certainly something to be aware of. 

What is Sprintec? ",1
"Sit on my butt and recover. I worked my tushie off a few days ago in my yard. 9AM to 3PM. For a lot of things, there is no setting between Off and On and I got a bit heat stroked and made it worse by not stopping till I was done.

So..plans for the day? Sit.",1
"I do and I really hate things like *stroke* are talked like as if it's nothing because it doesn't happen to most women who are on BC. It happens to zero woman who uses condoms.

Most women in my life tried BC at one point. EVERY one of them experienced at least one side effect, waited to get to use it, around 7 out of 10 of them didn't and stopped using it.",1
">. It happens to zero woman who uses condoms.

Uh, are you saying stroke is not considered a potential side effect of condoms? Because whilst that's true, you can definitely have a stroke outside of being on the pill. 


The risk for stroke in pregnancy is between 10-18 per 100 000 [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3137888/). The risk for stroke on the pill is 8 per 100 000 [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2634299/). Therefore, if you use condoms and they fail you have a greater risk of stroke than if you were on the pill.",1
"I meant condoms don’t have a side effect like stroke, obviously. Also the pill can fail too.",1
"Sure the pill can fail, but it's perfect use and typical use failure rate is significantly better than condoms. 

Unless you have a family history, migraines or you smoke, then your risk of stroke is essentially 'nothing'. ",1
"But it’s not nothing. My friend’s mother had a stroke, yes, but years after her daughter was on BC pills.  There are people who get misdiagnosed about the type of headache they have, etc. So they’re not even aware they’re actually in the “Unless...” group. And then there are other side effects. I get it’s the best option for some, everyone’s own choice anyway but re: the OP, I don’t think the side effects of BC are reported or talked enough.",1
">But it’s not nothing

At a risk of 0.00008% for most people it's negligible. Having a stroke is a tragedy, but for the vast majority of people stroke risk from the pill is negligible. Especially when you consider the rate of overall stroke is 545/100 000 [source]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4125206/). 

Do you warn women about getting pregnant because of the increased risk of stroke?",1

"All of the suggestions here have been wonderful, and I don't believe my mine will add much.  

I would suggest that you continue to just be present.  There really isn't anything to do when loved ones are in the process of leaving us but be there with them.  Dying, of course, is not something to be avoided but another part of life to be cherished.  It is as important as giving birth, a first kiss, marriage, having children, and seeing them grow.   Your being present in the moment will help your mother to also be present.  Your fearlessness will provide comfort and help her to pass in serenity.  Sometimes the dying are worried about being a burden.  Try to enjoy these moments so that she too enjoys them.  ",1
"Sorry to hear about what you are going through.  I would record her- ask her questions about her family, what it was like growing up.  There is a really great book (sorry I'm at work and don't have it handy) that we used with my great grandmother.  We just recorded us chatting with her, asking her these questions, like a normal conversation.  20 years later, it's awesome to have those tapes of her talking about her childhood and talking about her life and her family and the world.  

Love is always a great topic.  Ask her to talk about how her and your father met (even if you already know the story, have her tell you again).  Ask things like how it made her feel.  Ask what are some funny things they did together.  Ask what her advice would be if you were getting married or having kids or whatever you have left in life that she won't be there to experience that you want to accomplish.  

If you aren't able to video record, at least record her voice speaking with you.  

When I was very little, I had gotten a tape recorder for Christmas and I was recording Christmas at my grandparents.  I found the tape about 10 years later and listened to it.  By this point my grandpa had unexpectedly passed away.  The tape was pretty ""normal"" just all of my cousins and everyone talking through the day- us being kids.  Then it got to the end of the tape- the very last thing before the tape ended was our family leaving for the day and my grandpa's voice saying, ""mablesyrup, come over here and give me a kiss and a hug goodbye"".  I cried for days.  ",1
"I think a lot of people are forgetting the most important thing. I would love to ask my mom millions of questions, but most of all I would tell my mom how much I love her and cherish the time with her. I knew my mom would pass, but I never thought it would be real. My mom had a really slow decline and passed the day day before Thanksgiving this past year. Just cherish your mom OP and have light hearted conversation with her and make a memory. ",1
"Record her voice. It's been said before, but record it. Record her saying how much she loves you, saying things like happy birthday and Merry Christmas, and copy it to the point where you have dozens of copies in the house. 

Ask her about her most favorite moment with you when you were a baby, then ask about her most frightening moment. 

Ask her what she regrets. Chances are, she regrets something with you or in her life you can fulfill or tell her she doesn't need to regret, because you are okay. 

Hug her. Oh my gosh, hug her tight and try to memorize her body heat. Her kiss on your cheek. Try to remember her smells. They'll fade with time unless you box specific things away for safe keeping. And even then, the memory of her warmth will fade unless you have an excellent memory. 

Video her, if you want to remember her in her current state. My biggest regret with my Mother's passing was that I always listened to her complaints of hating being on camera, and recorded other people in the room instead. Now I watch those videos wishing I had turned the camera just a little, just enough to catch her in it. 

",1
"Family history.

Several months before my grandmother passed, my uncle hauled out his video camera and the family photo albums and recorded her going through them stating who was in the photo and, if she knew, the story behind the photo. For the most part, that is the only family history I have. While I knew some of it back then (1985) time has taken a toll on those memories.

We tried to do the same with my mother when her health started declining. She refused because she believed that we thought she would soon die (she was present when my uncle taped their mother). Her body was failing, not her mind at that time. Long story short, she remained in relatively decent health for several more years before having a stroke. Sadly, with the exception of the eldest, the only memories her grandchildren will have of her is a woman who was sick and could barely speak. If she had let us record when we asked, they would see the strong woman she was. Not to mention they will not know who many of the people are in the photos from almost a 100 years ago because we aren't sure (by time I got interested in family history there weren't many left to ask).

God knows how much family history has been lost/forgotten.",1
"Record all the stories. My mom, aunts, and uncles always tell these great stories whenever they get together about their childhoods, their parents, their dog, their school, old flames, cross-country road trips, crazy great-aunts that passed long ago, etc, etc. Also some old family histories about my grandmother's family in Northern Ireland and my grandfather's family adventures in Atlantic City during Prohibition. They always talk about writing it all down, but they never do. I'm currently trying to record some of them with my mom, we'll see how it goes! Spoken stories get filtered and changed and lost with each passing generation, it's so great to preserve them for the future.",1
,
"In addition to all the other lovely suggestions,

- Record her laugh.  Either just audio, or if you're both comfortable with a camera, a video.  I miss the way my grandma's eyes sparkled just like a little girl when she laughed.

- Ask for a letter or recording of why she's proud of you.  Something to give encouragement to get you through the hard times in life.

- If there are grandkids, ask for advice for them.  How to know they've chosen the right husband or wife, the right career, and other issues that you've already passed but they have yet to face.",1
"My mom passed away last summer, and I think constantly about what I should have asked and said.  I'm in my late twenties and dating is a weird thing - I wish I had asked her more about her relationships, both with my Dad and before him.  What made her swoon, what drove her away, what did she look for and what did she put up with?  I wish I had asked her about how sad she was when her Grandma died or when her Dad killed himself.  I was there for both, but she just put on such a brave front for my brother & I that I have no idea what her grief was like or how she learned to cope.  That would help me so much now.  And I'd ask what she wanted to know from me.  I'd answer any question with open honesty.  ",1
"This might be something you haven't thought of, but make sure she writes down all of her online accounts and passwords. Passwords for her ATM and to login to her computers and cellphone. Passwords for websites for her banks, credit cards, utilities, insurance, social media, email, etc. Ask for answers to common security questions for those websites.

This will make finding important documents and information 1000x easier, especially if she doesn't have someone around her who knows this information already.",1
"I definitely agree with everyone mentioning recording her telling stories but there are other things too. 

Account numbers, documents, online passwords, pin numbers. You'll need all of that later to get her affairs sorted once she's gone. ",1
"I'm sorry to hear about your mother. My dad passed away almost two years ago and I wish I knew more details about him. My family isn't big about talking. I bought my mother a memory book like you do for babies growing up and it asks those question you want to know about adults. I hope everyday she fills it out because I feel like I don't know crap about my mother which is upsetting. 

Write down questions you want to know personal, intimate and important stuff like financial things for when she passes. I would just ask and see what type of response she has. ",1
"My mom passed away from cancer last year and she declined too quickly for me to ask much. I am so sorry that you have to go through this - it's...I don't have a lot of words for what it's like. You know.

My husband and I were thinking about starting a family when she started declining, so for me, I wanted to have as much information about her for me and so I could have something to share about her with my future child. I bought a book similar to [this](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/all-about-my-grandmother-alex-a-lluch/1016203918?r=1&ean=9781934386606&kpid=9781934386606&cm_mmc=GooglePLA-_-Book_Under5-_-Q000000633-_-9781934386606) and that really helped to lead the conversation and can give you specific ideas on questions to ask. You can write down the answers or better yet record them so you can hear them in her voice. Unfortunately, I did this too late. I thought I had more time, but she was too weak and couldn't answer much.

My mom hated having video taken or her picture taken while she was sick because she didn't want to be remembered as a cancer patient, but we got a video of her on the last day she was really lucid. We took her outside and had lunch and she was smiling. I watch it all the time and she's right, I wish I had some video of her where she looked like the woman I remember and not my mom with cancer. That said...I'll cherish that video forever.

Along with that video, the only other recording I have of her voice is her voicemail message. My husband was able to get that off of her cell phone after she passed away for all of us.

A big help was my aunt. She made me a photo album of my mom when she was younger and I always have it nearby. Ask around for photos from your family members because they may have some that you've never seen.

In the present - just make sure you're there with her as much as possible. I gave my mom a little manicure and painted her nails while she was in bed. She always liked to have polish on her nails.

If you don't know already, you may want to ask her what she wants after she passes away. My mom and dad had talked about it and she definitely wanted to be cremated, but when I was talking with her alone out of the blue she mentioned that she wanted to be cremated in her wedding dress - something she hadn't told my dad before.

We didn't have a full funeral for her because she didn't want one. So it was just our family at the funeral home. They dressed her in her wedding dress just like she asked and we had a private room with her where we all just cried and shared special memories we had with her. 

Be there for your dad - losing a parent is a lot different than losing your spouse and he will be grieving in a completely different way.

Good luck with everything, feel free to PM if you need someone to talk to or not talk to.",1
"My dad had a stroke a year or so ago, and thinking about his mortality, I bought this book called All About Me by Philipp Keel. I ask my dad the questions, and write the answers in the book.  I highly recommend it.  Hugs.",1
"Ask about family health history and your own health history as a child. This probably varies from family to family, but I do not know a lot about my own health history as a child and neither of my parents is a reliable narrator for various reasons. SO. MANY. TIMES. since my grandma and my cousin, who babysat me a lot, have passed away, I have wished I had asked them this stuff. I have, for example, a drug that I am apparently allergic to but I have no idea what happens if it is given to me. If I ask my mom, she just giggles and says she doesn't remember. My grandma and cousin could have told me. I'm guessing your mom is willing and able to answer these types of questions, so you may want to ask them now while you still can.",1
"If she'll let you, try to record her talking to you. Even if all it does is preserve less-than-stellar memories of her post-stroke and with cancer, it's something. I wish I have a video of my mom talking or laughing, even though by the end of her time with MS, she was nothing like the woman I knew when I was little.

I wish I had more childhood stories. I only have a few, and what little my dad can remember. To be honest, I don't know a whole lot about the person my mom was, because she got sick when I was very young, so she was always just ""Mom, sick"" to me. In a way, that's kind of nice, because I can tell myself she was perfect. If you don't want to kid yourself, find out what she believes, what she thinks about. Plans she had for you. How she felt or what she thought about the first time she held you. ",1
"Do you have children? Get a journal & ask for family recipes, or her favorite recipes.. how to get a stain out of carpet, advice for how to handle moody teenagers. Think of when you'd call her would it be for a dinner recipe or to ask what she would do in a situation? Write it all down. My grandfather passed away last month, he was like my father. Im so glad I knew it was coming & could ask him what his favorite songs were, his favorite movies. Food was our ""thing"" he took me to sushi before i was 2, when i was 7 we had our first thia food lunch date. Chinese was our regular, when he was in the hospital after a heart attack i actually had a chinese restaurant deliver to us in the hospital so he would eat something. Sorry! looks like I've gone on rambling. 
In addition to asking questions about her ask about parenting advice (if thats relevant) ask if theres something she wished she had done that you should definitely do. And write it all down!! ",1
"Ask her about her life. Her memories. Her parents, and grandparents, and the rest of her family. About the jobs she had, the places she went, her memories of your and your siblings that you might not know about. Ask her what you were like as a kid. Ask her what she loves and what makes her happy. Bring her those things where you can.

Ask her about her health history too - you will want to know about this.

Ask her about what she wants for her funeral, does she want to be an organ donor, does she want to be buried, where? Ask her what she wants done with her things. Make sure she updated her will. 

Help her record her memories. Write a book, record a story. Help her write a journal.

I'm sorry you have to go through this, and I'm touched by this question. My Dad had a stroke too.",1
,
"I was in the exact same situation with my mom and here are some things that mean a lot to her and me:

- We did recordings of her singing the nursery rhymes and her favorite songs.  
- I made recording of her telling me about her childhood.  I hope to make these stories into a book one day.
- I have a recording of her singing happy birthday to me.
- She had me write personal letters to all my brothers and sisters with her memories of them when they were little and her hopes for them in the future.
- She taught me all the recipes she was known for.  We did this over a baby monitor I set up between her room and the kitchen.  I wrote everything down and practiced each dish with her telling me all the nuances.  This ended up being wonderful because it gave her purpose although she couldn't get out of bed.


Mainly, the things that meant the most during that time were making her feel needed and useful even though she couldn't get out the bed.  I let her call the shots and make the decisions as long as she could.  For example, I took pictures of her garden and let her tell me what to do.  She loved couponing, so I would help her clip and sort coupons.  She wanted to buy birthday gifts for the grandchildren so I went online shopping and ordered things she wanted to get and showed her the pictures.

I hope this is helpful to you.  The period right before my mom passed away were sad, but I got to know my mom on a level that I would not have been able to otherwise.",1

Before my grandmother passed away, maybe 6 months before, I was able to record a short candid video of her telling an anecdote to my husband. Sometimes I watch it just to hear her voice and see her smile.

"I'd really like a way to make my mom's life easier. She has a gene mutation that causes her to have strokes. She had her first stroke in her twenties. There isn't a whole lot of information on her gene mutation and the problems that come with it, but someday I hope there is a cure for it or a way to prevent another person from having strokes starting in their twenties due to this mutation.

"I’m going to go with what my oldest said when meeting her baby sister (she was freshly 4 then). “Wow mommy, you make pretty babies.” It was funny and adorable, especially when she gave this big grin, knowing full well that she was included in that remark. I’ll take pride in that statement any day! 

And a second, much sadder but still sweet one. My best four legged friend of 11 years got ill very suddenly over the course of a week. By the time the vet got him in, my dog was in full kidney and liver failure. My daughter stayed right next to me all weekend, holding and stroking him, then hugging and stroking me too. He ended up passing away with him in my lap at home, my four year old leaning on my back to hug me. I was 8.5 months pregnant at the time, and I was just plain broken for weeks over it. Any time I’d start crying randomly, she’d stop what she was doing (even in other rooms), find me, hug me, and say different variations of “he loved you lots and you’ll see him again. we can have dreams of Strudel together!”.  She was incredibly understanding and strong during it, considering her age. She’s 5.5 now and still requests to hold the plaster of his paw print before bed sometimes so she “can dream of him”.

Gah, I’m choking up now thinking about it.",1

Yes. Our passionate discussion came to an abrupt halt and I helped him through it. He has Aspergers so stress became a meltdown.  Helping him through that became the immediate priority.,1

We all just don't really hug or do much physically affectionate stuff. I left their house with three bottles of wine, half a loaf of bread, a bunch of spare facial stuff, and ice packs (???). That's our love.

My grandfather went into surgery after a stroke. My aunt told him that we all loved him. As his kids' representative. He understood. That's just how they are. My aunt made sure today that my granddad had his fridge fully stocked with pancakes. That's love. Anyone can hug.

Sometimes it's easier to ask whoever I'm dating to come to a family outing (I even offer to DD). Then they understand.",1
"I used to be. I don't come from an affectionate family - at all. We never touched, hugged, or came in any sort of physical contact that wasn't hitting. We *never* said things like ""I love you"", ""I care about you"", ""I miss you"", or anything remotely similar. My family was like a bunch of roommates living together, at least after my mom passed when I was very little, so once it was time to date people I would get really uncomfortable with expressions of affection. It literally just confused me and I didn't know how to react. I just started forcing myself to get used to it and now I'm a very sweet/affectionate person, but earlier on...my stomach would tie in knots and I would break into sweats over something as simple as ""I miss you"" from a guy, and I would flinch as if about to be hit whenever they moved to touch me.",1
"I think you just have to find the right person to make you feel comfortable about things. Before, I never felt comfortable calling a boyfriend ""Honey,"" ""Baby,"" ""Sweetheart,"" etc. before I was dating my current boyfriend. I'm also not one for touching, at all.

My boyfriend will stroke my hand with a finger and if it feels weird, I pull away and rub my hand on something because it just makes me feel uncomfortable. But that being said, I'm more comfortable with touching or being close to him than I have with anyone else. He makes me feel more comfortable when I'm not feeling that way around anyone else.

Also, if it's not something that you like or feel comfortable with, find another way to show your affection, or make sure they're in the same boat or at least understanding.

As for answering your original question, when I want a guy to push or go passed my physical boundaries, I will generally guide his hand if he seems timid.  Even if he doesn't, I tend to be very clear with what I want and don't want in bed, or even in making out.  It can be very hard to get over a lot of the hang-ups and restrictions imposed upon oneself as a Christian (it's been 4 years for me), so just take it slow and make sure you feel comfortable doing anything - unless your discomfiture is a remnant of the religiousness, because then feel free to push through it a bit and see how you feel.",1

"I am sure other people will have some better tips but here's what has worked for me. 

You don't necessarily have to deep throat. You can use your hand in conjunction with your mouth, stroking up and down with it as you take the head in your mouth as far as you want to go. Let it be very wet --  drool a bit so your hand moves smoothly and wetly along with your mouth. You want it to seem like they are kind of one unit. Watch your teeth. Use your tongue to stimulate the frenulum (the knotty looking part on the underside of the penis) and gently squeeze and stroke the shaft with your hand. Using the other hand, stroke the balls or the perineum, or whatever your guy responds to more. 

Beyond this, it's really a good idea for you to solicit some direction from your man in terms of what he really wants from you. He's going to have particular sensitive parts that only he can really tell you about. 

Make sure you are enthusiastic, most of all, about learning how he works and doing it in general. Look up at him sometimes if you take a break to just lick the thing and tease him. Smile and make sounds. Admire him. Enjoy the experience. ",1

"Have you shown her the statistics proving that the risk of stroke is low? (Especially for a nonsmoker).  Does she know that you are sexually active now? If she does, you should stress the importance of preventing pregnancy. If she doesn't, you might want to tell her so that she doesn't blow you off because she's not worried about you getting pregnant. I'd also say that while acne reduction and shorter periods are great, your priority should really be on keeping yourself safe from unwanted pregnancy now. Also, IUDs aren't typically in women your age because many doctors refused to prescribe them for young women, but studies have shown that they're safe and extremely effective for teens. It's a lot better to go with something more effective, better safe than sorry. I personally have been on the Nuva Ring for 8 years and have never had an issue.

Depending on your financial situation, you and your mother may be able to reach a compromise where you get tested for clotting conditions before going on the pill.  They aren't cheap tests, and you would need to talk to your doctor and get a blood draw, but knowing you're not part of a high-risk group could put you both at ease.  

Honestly, though, I'd recommend going to a gyno, and discussing your options with the gynecologist and your mother.  A doctor will know what's worked for patients in her practice, as well as being up to date on products and research.

"Not a female, but a student MT.

Massage can help with shortened and tightened muscles.

Neck and Chest muscles (SCM, Scalenes, Pecs) are often shortened due to poor posture caused by ""desk work"" (As a PC gamer, mine are too) 

These often cause your back muscles to stretch and overextert themselves, (That chronic neck and trap pain everyone has) 

What you can do to help the muscles relax is scrub the attachment points of the muscles as it stimulates the Golgi Tendon Organ which sends signals for the muscles to release, as well as releasing endorphins. (If you ever had a good massage and felt a good ""woozy"" after, or during certain bedroom activities, it's probably the endorphins) 

You can do this yourself at home, but it would be best to go to a professional first.

If you do want to try it out, run your fingers right under your collarbone. You'll may feel some tiny bumps or tenderness, and slowly massage them away (Heat is much better than pressure, so focus on warming up the area to smooth it out than brute strength.) Your pecs also attach to the sternum, so see if you can palpate anything there.

The Sternocleidomastoid is another major culprit for chest pain, since it attaches to both the clavicle and sternum. 

[Picture here](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/189659/file-28977451-png/images/sternocleidomastoid-attachments.png?t=1467831757830&width=310&height=387) 

[And another here](http://pocketdentistry.com/wp-content/uploads/285/F000047f004-001-9781437724196.jpg)

If this is shortened, it can pull your rib cage a bit out of whack. It would be on the top side of the collarbone, the top lateral (outward) edges of the sternum and the Mastoid process which is behind the ear. Though massaging this muscle can mess with the support your head has, it be best to have a professional do it while you're lying down. But once you have an idea where those muscles are attached and the procedure, I would kinda say try it for yourself. But again, I'm kinda going to school for it, so for me it's more self/preventive care rather then corrective.",1
Had to do that last night at the doctors and nearly passed out!,1
"I am a substitute teacher, so my days follow similar patterns, but aren't ever quite the same. I'm in several districts so my day starts anywhere from 7:05 to 8:50 am. I try to get to school fifteen to twenty minutes early so I can open up my classroom, read through the plans the teacher left, find a fridge for my lunch, check the teacher's mailbox, and go pee, because gods know when I'll have time for that again... 

I work in schools where I usually either have kids for 5 of 7 or 6 of 8 classes that are about fifty minutes long or 3 out of 4 ninety minute classes. Oftentimes I'll have ""coverage"" during prep times because basically every school is short on subs and I don't have anything to prep, so I'll spend my extra period(s) covering for other teachers that are out but didn't get their own sub. 

Class always starts with introducing myself, taking roll, and introducing the  work left for us by the teacher. While kids are working I'm around the classroom answering questions, keeping kids on task, confiscating cellphones, and/or praising the kids who aren't being pains in my bum. Repeat 3-5x per day, depending on schedule. 

The kids and classrooms are often new to me. Teachers don't have / use enough sick days that I get to be in the same class more than twice very often, though I am pretty consistent in the schools I go to.

I usually spend lunch schmoozing and prep cleaning / organizing. I normally get to leave between 2:30 and 4 pm.

"Also a registered nurse!

I work primarily within the realm of cardiology in a critical care setting (the only thing we do not do that ICU can is anything involving care of an intubated patient; we simply lack the resources for that). What we see are mostly heart attacks, people who require urgent pacemakers due to symptomatic bradycardia/AV block, those with deadly arrhythmias (such as ventricular tachycardia), and the really bad heart failure patients (usually requiring BiPap and/or inotropes). We sometimes get internal medicine patients who are very sick (i.e. diabetic ketoacidosis, really bad COPD exacerbations, drug overdoses), but they're the minority. I work 12 hour shifts and, within that timeframe, things can change rapidly. We once went from coasting along to having to code two patients at once.

Basically, my day starts off with getting my assignment and receiving report. I sit down, interpret my ECG strips, and go over what medications I have to give that day. I also mentally sort what I need to do during my shift - for example, if any of my patients need to go for tests or require dressing changes. Then I go assess my patients, usually starting with the most unstable if there is one in my assignment. After assessments, I try to fit in a bit of charting, then go around and give out my medications.

After that is anyone's guess what happens! I do more charting, answer call bells, give out medications, do some more charting, round with the doctor when he/she arrives, process doctors' orders, more charting, periodically interpret/record ECG strips, respond to any changes in my patients' conditions, update charge nurse of anything major going on, help out my co-workers if I'm able, and of course, do more charting. I always have a rough idea of when I should get things done, but like I said, things can change rapidly, so I mostly play things by ear.",1

My patients (all ages) have all kinds of problems while chronic (low back) pain being the most common. I mainly choose active methods over passive ones so most of the work is done by my patients, but I like to exercise together with back and neck pain patients.

This means that I was able to get very good at it very quickly (I draw anywhere from 40-150 patients per week as a part-time employee, whereas nurses or MAs, etc. may only draw that many people in 2-4 weeks).

"I’ve been dealing with stomach pain for the past year.  Had an endoscopy, came back ok.  Had a HIDA scan, also ok.  My first gastroenterologist thought my anxiety could be the cause.  Got a therapist, started back on anxiety meds, feel pretty good anxiety wise.  Stomach pain still there.  Got a new doctor who I just met with last week over telemedicine.  Doctor suspects functional dyspepsia but admits that diagnosis can refer to a wide range of things.  I am now taking Nexium for a few month to see if that helps get everything to calm down.  

It sucks, I feel like there isn’t a good answer to help with this.  My stomach hurts literally every day, just varying degrees.  I’ve accepted it more lately but sometimes it just knocks me out.  I’ve tried so many different things: DGL, zantac, Pepcid, FDgard (this might have helped a little but is super expensive), Prilosec (never for more than one month so doctor now wants me to try PPI for several months), marshmallow root.  The closest thing that came to helping especially with the heartburn was Gaviscon Advance (UK formula) but it’s made with an artificial sweetener and that was starting to hurt my stomach.

If the Nexium doesn’t work, I’m ready to do a complete overhaul of my diet.  I did try to eat better and that sometimes helps, but then I can eat something healthy like a salad that usually doesn’t bother me and it will.  It doesn’t seem like there is any rhyme or reason to what hurts me and what is ok.

Had my gallbladder removed in Jan. Still no relief. Then they diagnosed functional dyspepsia. Gave me some amitriptyline and said to eat using the FODMAP diet.

"I've just had this black cloud over my head all day, I have no idea what it is. Work is nothing but drama lately, today was just another instalment...

The main thing is my health though. I've never had this many problems before. I don't know if unexplained aches and pains is just a fact of life, but I just turned 22. Two years ago I was fine but now I just feel like everything's going wrong?  I've had depression since I was 14, but I've not had a bout of it for a few months. Since around that age I would get colds at least once a month, but again that's calmed down. I fell on my tailbone when I was younger, the pain eased off but it's sort of returning.

Other issues: chest pains. I had a chest infection 2 years ago and ended up with stabbing pains, which the doctor told me was just muscle inflammation and it would go away in a month or so. I STILL HAVE THEM. After about 3 months I went back to the doctor, who then diagnosed it as panic attacks to go with my depression & anxiety. Right. So I made myself feel like I was having a heart attack three times a day? I had no previous history of it so I disagreed. Then I was told that no, it was potentially a blood clot and I had to have a load of testing done for that, but nope. Now i've been told it's probably (note, probably) costochondritis. Doctor says it will go away. Research says if I've had it for this long it's probably chronic, which upsets the hell out of me. No one seems to understand how debilitating it is, I get told I'm making it up, I'm exaggerating, I'm being silly, all sorts.

My back pain is really killing me lately. It's hard to work 8 hours a day at a desk, on top of that I 2 hour round trip commute in which I have to sit in a car, so that's 10 hours a day sat down. And because of the chest pain, guess what, I can't do many forms of exercise! Yay for me! I can swim, 9 times out of 10 I don't get any chest pain. I just get headaches from the chlorine. Aerobics, running or any kind of jumping around makes me feel like I'm having a heart attack. I can't even cycle, which is my favourite thing to do but it's just not worth the pain. Yet I will also get chest pains when I'm just sat down doing nothing. ARGH.

My periods are also really fucked up lately. The pain...

Oh. and a recurring stomach ulcer. Lets just throw that into the mix.  And a newly gained wheat intolerance.

Plenty more to rant about but I will stop... I'm fine for a while and then everything happens at once and all I can do is collapse into bed and cry.

"Abortion is illegal where I live.

My mom got me the pills, but the abortion went wrong. It also failed. I almost bled to death and fell unconscious. I woke up in the hospital.

Technically I had parental consent, no judicial bypass to go through because it's illegal anyway.",1
"I was carrying a 4'x8' 3/4 plywood with 2""x4"" framed platform on to a truck. The truck was not backed up squarely to the loading dock and so there was a slight gap between the two. After carrying several of those guys on, on the last one, the VERY LAST ONE, I stepped off the loading dock wrong and ended up between the dock and the truck. Dangling with one leg sort of on the truck, one in the gap and my hand squarely between this hundred pound platform and the dock. 

The person at the other end picked it up so I could get out  from under it. I took a look at my fingers, which were very bloody and felt myself go pale (er as I am a redhead), I climbed up the dock, hand wrapped in the lower half of my shirt, I walked calmly but quickly (it was noted by rest of the staff) to the office where I sat in the bathroom and washed it. I nearly passed out while cleaning it.

My boss took me to get it looked at, we suspected broken bones, but thankfully I just skinned (planed if you will) my middle finger on my right hand. I think it was 9 stitches total and I have a sweet 'c' shaped scar! The other fingers had some incidental lascerations but nothing nearly as rough",1
"I always find that it hurts less when I wax myself. For me, it's kind of like how tickling myself doesn't work; I know when it's going to happen, so it's not a shock and it elicits a much less powerful response than if someone else did it. I'm perfectly capable of ripping a strip of cooling wax off my mons without so much as a tear. If someone else did it? Call the ambulance now, she might have a heart attack.",1
"If she's a great girl, I really hope you won't pass on her just because of her father! My father and I don't have the best relationship and he is very, very overprotective of me. But I recently introduced my boyfriend to him (this is the first time I've ever introduced a guy to my dad) and it went pretty well.

If he is overprotective and unreasonable, the bad news is that he is probably going to stay that way. However, you can make the situation easier on everyone by introducing yourself to her dad and making a good impression. Overprotective fathers usually prefer to know who they're dealing with (the secrecy of going out with ""some random guy"" is shady to them) and a brief introduction can save a lot of trouble. Be polite and well mannered, don't be afraid to make eye contact, look presentable (I'm not talking suit and tie, but leaving the stained tshirt, basketball shorts, and flip flops at home can make a big difference). If he wants her home at a certain time, respect that. Let him know what you guys are doing (""Thank you for letting me take her out to the movies, we'll be back by 11."") 

I know it seems ridiculous and very high school, but speaking as the daughter of an unreasonably overprotective dad, her dad is just looking out for her and if she really likes you, there's no reason why you can't still have an awesome relationship. Feel free to PM me if you want to ask me anything else, hope I helped a bit because I've been in this situation too and I know it sucks. ",1
"She should have never been left alone the day after spinal surgery :( Sepsis is a real thing, it can kill you, and definitely put her into the state she was in. With treatment, she should go back to normal.

If she goes into a nursing home, they will make her spend down all of her assets to 8K before medicaid will kick in. It also must be medically necessary. Her health insurance may provide nursing care once or twice a day, but also only if medically necessary. You could hire someone who does home health care by the hour, or to stop in once a day and check on her.

How about seeing if she'd be interested in a roommate? Someone to help with the expenses, and keep an eye on her?

As far as me, I moved my Mom to a house a 1/2 mile from me. We each maintain our autonomy, but I can easily check in on her regularly and/or run down if she needs anything.

If either of my parents get to the point they can't care for themselves, they will always be 100% welcome in my home, and I will always care for them. They did an amazing job raising me, and I will always be there for them. That being said, that solution isn't for everyone, and there is no 'right' or 'wrong', just what is right for you, and right for them. Best wishes, and good luck.",1
"Ooof,  that's hard,  OP.   

Talk to the hospital and ask them to point you toward local resources.   Many communities or regions have counselors that will help you look at your options,  know what's available. 

My mom is in her 90s; my dad passed a few years ago at 93.  They lived in the house I grew up in,  on their own,  too a ripe old age, but we've talked to these agencies about what to do eventually. ",1
"I'm lucky (well not really), but both my parents have passed away so I won't ever have to deal with this. My dad died of a plane crash (mechanical issues) at 55. He did have congestive heart failure, diabetes, and a host of other issues at the time, but wasn't generally debilitated. A year later my mom was diagnosed with kidney cancer that had already spread everywhere. It was only a month between her diagnosis and her passing. My sister and my aunts were the ones who took her to all her doctor's appointments and she lived in the spare bedroom at my sister's house during that last month until she was in the hospital and then at home hospice for 2 days (I live a state away). It sucks that they're gone obviously, but one of the silver linings is that I won't have to deal with elder care. 

For OP, getting a social worker to start planning how to take care of things would be ideal. Things like having a home care nurse stop by daily to check on her may be beneficial. Getting someone who knows what programs are available would be super helpful. ",1
"Your mom is 62 -- can she get Medicaid or Medicare Part A? They will pay for nursing care. You'll have to look into your state's requirements for applying. There's generally a 60-month lookback rule when applying for Medicaid, so if your mom needs to go into nursing care NOW, you won't be able to hide assets (i.e., consider transferring them to a kid) without a penalty (this of course may also differ by state; I have no idea). 

I'd talk to your mom about a will, a living will, power of attorney, financial power of attorney, etc., when/if she is able. As far as what you're discussing of someone checking in on her...you mean like a home nurse? I'd run that by the hospital or your mom's GP. Insurance may cover it because it may be cheaper for them to do that than to risk more hospitalization.



As for my own personal situation...my mom is in her late 50s and my dad is retired and in his early 60s. Mom is half-blind from a stroke, has diabetes, mobility problems, etc. Dad is mostly immobile. How they're making it financially is beyond me. They are one sort-of-big disaster away from losing their house.

I have printed out a bunch of applications for senior co-op apartments that are subsidized in the area: it would help them out a lot financially, they'd have fewer home responsibilities, etc. I filled out almost all of it except for signatures They refuse to fill it out.

It's very frustrating. When my dad dies, my mom will get almost nothing -- no where near enough to live on, not even when she turns 62. I dread the day, to be honest with you. Neither of my parents were 'good' parents (narcissism) and I can't allow her toxicity into my house. My family comes first.

If my mom dies, my dad is also screwed. He can do almost nothing for himself. He does have mobility problems, but this began long before that. He doesn't know how to do simple self-care things. My mom has told me several times, ""You'll have to come over and pay the bills, make him dinner..."" Nope. I will help where I can, but he will have to learn and in-home help will have to provide the rest. I have a fledgling family to care for. I can't take on doing everything for another.

When the day comes that one of them wants to move in with me, I'll be screamed at, cussed out, etc., for my refusal. It'll be, ""You never helped us!"" Then I'll be standing there saying, ""Really? I helped you with a bunch of housework, gave you opportunities to improve your financial situation, and you shrugged it all off.""

They are the sorts of people who will be speeding toward a wall. You scream, ""You're going to hit that wall!"" They look at you blankly and say, ""Yeah, but not yet, so we're going to keep speeding."" Then they either just barely miss it or slam head-on. Then they climb from the wreckage and go, ""Oh my God, we hit the wall!"" Ya think?

"I guess they're fortunate because I'm a trained nurse so they know that if things get bad I would be more than happy to move back in with them and take up full time care. My parents put their life and soul into raising me so I wouldn't even think twice about trying to return the favour. My parents have eachother though and are still madly in love. My dad had a stroke last year and my mother was very good at looking after him. Likewise, my mother has had several lapses of cancer over the year and my dad was there to look after her.

For your situation I understand it's more tough. I'm passing no judgement on you as a person but your mother should never have been left alone after major surgery such as spinal. That's on the hospital staff also because they should know to never discharge someone who had serious treatment to an empty house unless there was someone looking after her.

I don't really know what to say to you. Your options are either move in with her and try take some of the care on yourself (which I know can be very personally demanding and even if you do this you'll still need assistance from trained professionals), hire private carers to come see her several times a day, or look into putting her into a facility where she can be appropriately cared for. All of these options are tough and expensive and I really feel for you. 

Seek input from social services; it's their job to help people in your situation find the most appropriate solution to looking after your mother. I'm not from America so unfortunately I don't know an awful lot about your healthcare system or insurance or anything like that, but there definitely is help available you just need to ask for it and keep asking for it.

Also, bear in mind that if the hospital can cure the sepsis then it's likely a lot of her medical problems such as the hallucinations may go away so this situation may not be as tough in the future as it is now. Talk to her physician about this. 

Best of luck, I honestly wish you all the best. ",1
"A very similar thing happened with my dad last year. He had surgery for colon cancer that went fine but later developed sepsis and ended up in a coma. It was awful. He slowly recovered but apparently being under heavy sedation for a long period of time leads to some pretty serious issues, including a loss of muscle strength. My dad had trouble getting around before but now can't stand unaided and can barely walk. This means he can no longer live in his isolated mountain home filled with stairs. 

For awhile my he was staying with my younger brother, who owns a house, but that wasn't working out and actually almost destroyed their relationship, so I found a two bedroom apt and my dad moved in with me. We split the rent and bills just like roommates and so far it's worked out well. But my dad doesn't require any caretaking really. Obviously I want him to live forever but honestly I hope he dies before his body or mind fails completely. I know that sounds awful but I have no idea what we'll do if he requires long term care. None of us can afford it.",1
"As far as the first incident goes its a bit foggy still. The information is very jumbled because I could never get a straight answer. I had tried calling her when she lived further away. She's always been good about answering the phone or getting back to me within the hour during normal hours. When I didn't hear from her I called her work and she hadn't shown up but they didn't give me any information as to whether she called out or not. I called my uncle who lived closer to her than I did to see if he had heard from her. She had called him saying she couldn't get out of bed. So he took her to the hospital. She was fine the next day. Completely back to normal. She stayed with my uncle on that occasion. 

She has no memory of that incident. 

About a month later, she sent me a text saying her primary thinks she had a stroke. She had driven to her primary care doctor, confused, and been told that they should probably call an ambulance for her and she refused. She drove herself home. I called her and told her to call an ambulance, but she didn't want to deal with the cost. She's the most bull headed human being I know. She drove herself to the hospital and was told in the ER that she had no signs of a stroke. I picked her up from the hospital when I got there and she was completely out of it. The clarity she had on the phone was gone. The next morning I woke up to her unable to figure out how to put her underwear on or where anything was in the house. 

I spent much of the next few weeks in her apartment trying to take care of her and back and forth between my place and the doctors office trying to figure out what had happened. They still cant tell us exactly what happened. They blame it on a mixed combination of medications. 

She doesn't remember the events of about 4-5 days for that incident. 

With it happening more than once, I find it hard to believe that it was just medication, but they keep trying to shove that answer down my throat. 


I will absolutely go to her primary with her to see what we can find out. She is currently in the hospital still, and I've been working with a caseworker to try to get her placed in rehab for physical therapy and to have a little more time with care, but all of the places are declining her because she's able to walk 200 feet. Her insurance won't cover much because she's taken the minimum insurance as she does. 

I will see if they have a senior care specialist though. And see if there are any services for where we live. ",1
"She is slowly getting back to normal. I'm afraid this will happen again, though. Considering the complete memory loss has happened more than once prior to the surgery I don't feel like sepsis was the ONLY culprit here. I do feel like it played a nice big part in the hallucinations, though. 

I honestly don't think she has more than 5K in assets aside from owning her car. 

I know she would hate a roommate. I've talked to her about it before, but shes one of those people who have lived alone so long that they're set in their ways. She hasn't had anyone but me living with her since I was 8mos old. Almost 25 years. I wish she'd let a roommate live with her. It'd make life a heck of a lot easier. :P 

I think I might work on finding her a place that is close to me like you've done with your mother. For the most part shes able to function completely normally. Its just when she has the episodes that shes been having this year that I get up in arms worried about her being by herself. On top of the fact that shes getting older, I feel like I might be jumping the gun and trying to be overly cautious with worry. ",1
"The rehab place is ideal - I'm a CNA in a facility like that. We usually have patients stay 2-3 weeks post surgery to get them back on their feet. As soon as you mentioned her confusion, I immediately jumped to infection, so sepsis was unsurprising. Even something as simple as a UTI can make geriatric patients lose their marbles. It's the most bizarre thing... One day they'll be totally with it and clear as day, the next they are telling you that they are pregnant and need to get to the hospital to give birth to a beautiful baby boy. If you can get her into a rehab facility, I definitely recommend it. There are things such as home health aides who can come however often you like, but that one-on-one attention can sometimes be much more expensive. My grandfather is in his 70s and had trouble taking care of a leg wound - being terrified of doctors and too stubborn to admit he needed help, it progressed to a stage 4 leg ulcer (gaping hole in his leg). We did phased him down care-wise slowly: hospital -> rehab -> home health nurse daily (to help him shower and do dressing changes) -> home health nurse weekly -> no nurse, just check-ins with my mom. Definitely see if she has been assigned a social worker - they can direct you to facilities and help you figure out what the best course of action will be for her. ",1
If the time hasn't already passed you should definitely talk to your mom about upping her insurance when open enrollment comes.,1
"First off, I want to say that I'm very sorry I don't have a solution and that you have to go through this. I know how draining and challenging it is, so I wish you much strength.

> About a month later, she sent me a text saying her primary thinks she had a stroke.

I am SO not a medical expert, but my MIL had a similar event of confusion and it was probably a minor stroke, or what they more accurately call a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA). She didn't suffer the classic symptoms of a major stroke, but instead she went from being really mentally sharp and able to care for herself, to suddenly and abruptly being unable to finish her sentences, and unable to do tasks completely herself. She would ""pantomime"" doing things like brushing her teeth, but she wasn't actually doing it. 

She had the presence of mind to know she was in trouble and asked a neighbor to take her to the hospital. When we went to her house to collect her things, it was clear she was mentally not quite right that day - things a bit scattered and out of place in a weird way.

Anyway, although she lived less than 5 miles away, she came to live with her son and I when they sent her home from the hospital. We knew one day this would be a likely event, but it was sudden and we were utterly unprepared for how much surveillance she required to be safe and to be cared for. I didn't sleep a wink for the few days she was with us.

She had another TIA, more recognizable as a stroke, the third night she was with us during dinner. At first I wasn't sure if it was significant, but I googled her symptoms and called an ambulance immediately. At the hospital they confirmed it was TIA. After a few days of hospital care, they started discussing rehabilitation programs for her. I aggressively advocated for finding a skilled facility that she could live in rather than coming to live with us.

Sadly, I don't have much advice to offer because for one thing, MIL never made it home from the hospital - she had a major stroke and died before she could be discharged. Additionally, she was 86 years old, so had Medicare and supplemental insurance, and she had financial reserves to draw on if she had had to pay out of pocket for skilled nursing care.

And ultimately, as hard as it was on us, we would have of course taken her in if the skilled care didn't work out. I was just deeply concerned about our ability to care for her properly with the level of safety and comfort she needed/deserved. But we would have given it every effort.

Years earlier MIL dealt with her sister no longer being able to live on her own. Fortunately, the sister had purchased specific insurance to cover skilled care in a home for a few years, so when the sister's Alzheimers became too much to handle amongst us, she was well cared for in a home for the rest of her life. She actually did quite well there.

MIL had two cats, we have two cats. All four cats are currently under our roof, albeit, not sharing space quite yet. One of my MIL's cats is an alpha female, and well, isn't respecting the fact that I'm doing *her* a favor by bringing her in. She makes a beeline to start trouble when I let her out in the same space as my cats. I'm working on slowly getting everyone used to each other by stages.",1

It started with a ""fuck you"" when I asked him to bring a bowl of veggies from the kitchen to the dining table instead of just sitting there allowing me to serve him AFTER making dinner without his help every day AFTER working 40 hours same as him.

I couldn't ask him to do the simplest thing, without him pouting or having a tantrum. I saw these things early on, but because I'd never encountered these traits in anyone, I ignored them.

I have started sorting them chronologically and reading his words to me at different points in my life is very comforting even if it is sad and hurts.

\- Linked to that: Try to keep a recording of their voice. The thought that I will never hear his voice again and maybe forget how it sounded suddenly came to me after he passed and I spent a long time frantically searching for a recording or video where he is speaking.

When working on a team project where ideas and approaches make a difference, I am often glad that the idea has two parents and more likely to move forward.  Others have always noted and credited me as needed as well as appreciated my not creating an issue over the idea generation or work authorship.  I’m sure the one appropriating the idea received the “credit” for their behavior.  If not, I’ve more productive things to do than dwell on credit for past work.

One can also see this behavior as a tool.  Rather than have future ideas or work passed over, enlist this person to support your work.  They can also become a supporter for you on future projects, as you are potentially more valuable than others.

Not for everyone or every such situation, but I suggest careful consideration and use in appropriate situations.

One of my sons, when someone turned in his paper as his own work, when confronted by the teacher and the fine fellow denied copying the paper asked the other fellow about a word in the paper whose meaning the fine fellow didn’t know.

Nothing else. I want to know if he remembered the trip, if he remembered Greece before he left. If he missed it there,  why he didn't teach Greek to his children.

He always said, “If anything happens to me, someone will contact you, and you will be taken care of.” But when he passed, his family absolutely hated my mother and I. From my understanding, they were partially racist and didn’t want us at his funeral service and never told us his resting place. That was nearly 10 years ago. 

To this day I don’t know where his final resting place and I never received any closure to his death. I never got to say goodbye to the one man who took me in, looked after me, and paid for my college education. I never told him how much I loved him and how much he meant the world to me.

"Marguerite d'Angouleme. Sister to King Francis I. Raised during the early Renaissance she was considered the first educated woman in Europe. She wrote poetry+plays, and was basically single handedly responsible for holding off persecution of the protestants in France while she lived despite being a Catholic until her death. Literally, as soon as she died her brother Francis allowed several laws persecuting protestants of all stripes to be passed which resulted in several massacres and 8 religious wars. She was a Queen of Navarre and helped run her husband's entire estate, and was deputized on more than one occasion to act as an ambassador and diplomat both for her husband and her brother, including riding nonstop for over a week to meet a deadline to free her brother from imprisonment during a war. She was also a patron of the arts, including Leonardo da Vinci. She was widely loved by both her own people and her brother's and would move freely and without any sort of protection or escort among common people which was incredibly dangerous for most nobility, but she was known to be so charitable and generous that she never came to any harm. She also saw to it that her daughter Jeanne was educated as well as she had been. Jeanne inherited the Kingdom of Navarre, was also known to be incredibly intelligent and acknowledged as a capable leader at a time that few women were, and Jeanne's son went on to be Henry the Great, aka Good King Henry of France.",1

When my Father in law passed away very suddenly a group of nurses had pineapple pins made in his memory. A little back story so that you will understand the meaning of this.

I didn’t think I was able to laugh in such a difficult and heart shattering time but when we were done, we looked at my sister’s (who is not artistic at all) side of the gingerbread house and it looked terrible. We all had a good laugh about it. I have so many friends and family who were present for me but this was a special something that felt good after the tragedy. Everyone was so focused on how we were feeling that I really appreciated the small distraction. 

I had another childhood friends come the night off his passing and she held me for hours late into the night. I’m truly grateful for her too",1

"Thank you so much for your advice. I will try to take it to heart. I've already acted upon much of it.

A lot of things have been complicated by corona, as well as the fact that we were living in a different country - I had only been there for a year, arriving a few months before corona struck, so I never had any friends or social support there, and our parents weren't able to come visit, again due to corona. But we're back in our home country now (since a week ago), where we grew up and where our parents live, so we're able to receive so much more support now, and it really is making a huge difference.  
This really is the worst time to be dying, when everything is shut down, and you're not able to do any of the things you want to. And at the same time, the risk of corona itself is something that would likely cut her life even shorter, so we really can't take many risks. Even getting married is proving to be a little difficult. But we'll manage, even if it'll end up a bit unorthodox. 

I'm sorry for rambling a bit. And for such a belated reply. Thank you again so much. <3

My SO is Latino as well but he is considered a white passing Latino where some people may assume he is American/non Spanish speaker. 

because of where we live and people assuming I’m not biracial we’ve never had any harassment about our relationship. However I do get weary and worry about traveling to “whiter” more rural parts of the US as I wonder if people will treat me and my SO differently or have certain assumptions because I am more “ethnic looking” than he is. 

To play it safe I think my travels along the continental US will be mostly focused on densely populated major cities. :)",1
"I’m mixed (Asian passing) and there is always so much bullshit, often it’s subtle like racist jokes and offhand remarks but sometimes it’s disgusted stares and being made to walk in the gutters and threats and being followed. But my white partners were always oblivious to it and the worst of it never came out when they were around. 

Honestly I have trouble believing these other commenters who don’t think they have experienced any racially based harassment. If they’ve never experienced it how could they notice it? I remember walking around with a mixed race black friend of mine, and he insisted on crossing a street to avoid a group of young white men I hadn’t even noticed, but they were all staring him down and seemed to be posturing for a fight. If he hadn’t pointed them out I never would have known, and I experience more racism than a white or white passing woman.",1
"I've been with my bf for 11 years and luckily we haven't experienced outright harassment for being together. I'm mixed middle eastern and white (but pretty white passing according to most) and my bf is Chinese. We haven't had issues with racism while traveling, but we have in our home country. However, the racism was more targeted towards him directly, so basically it was strangers being racist and shitty towards him while walking together. 

The first time was when we were 17 or so and this group of white teenage boys started making 'ching chong' and similarly original mocking noises as we passed by. The second time was when we were in our early 20s. My bf and I were walking home together holding hands, and two black girls started yelling at my bf about having a small penis and other disgusting stereotypes when we passed by them. 

The second situation really caught me off guard. Maybe I was really naive, but I didn't expect two individuals who probably had their own experiences with racism to say such garbage about another person. It really made me open my eyes to how pervasive anti-asian racism is and how it can be perpetuated by all races, even in the country I live in.",1
"Because no one was. He accidentally locked eyes with a stranger, they looked back. That's all that happened. They didn't turn around and point, they didn't whisper to the person next to them.

Sitting alone and stressed in a waiting room,  worrying about a loved one is a miserable thing to endure. She brings a deck of cards or a book and will sit with her friend to make the time pass more quickly. If they want to talk or play, then great. If they just want to sit, they sit. They are still going to worry about their loved one, but they don’t have to do it alone.",1

"My mother is the most forgiving, merciful person I know. She taught me to give the benefit of the doubt to the ones we love. She taught me that a loved one can fuck up and still be worth loving. She demonstrated how much courage it takes to be warm and kind, when other people could use it against you. And how to continue to be kind, even when they do. I don’t know if I can say she passed that down to me, but I know I sure try to be more like her in that aspect. 

This generation is all about self fulfilment, self serving, self protection, self importance. Which are all healthy things, in measure. But I feel the other side - serving others, forgiving others, protecting others - kind of get left behind. Even though they are equally important to self worth and happiness in the long run, I think. 

She also passed down the notion of letting your child be and find who she is. Letting her find her way, and being the soft place to land when, at times, she loses her way. I hope to pass this down to my son and possible future children when the time comes. 

Also, on a less serious note, to turn duvet covers inside out and pull them over the duvet that way.

I’m cash broke but credit rich—thanks, mom!

Mostly amounts to beings aware of your surroundings and make eye contact with anyone shady.

Nowadays, I'm an elementary school teacher and I see how some kids are never taught manners and how to be respectful of others. So I think that's what I want to teach my kids.

- yawn really loud
- curse
- loudly pass gas
- stuff my mouth/ chew loudly/ slurp
- not say thank you when people give me things
- not saying hi to people when out and about

Not everyone considers these things bad manners and that's okay. But some of these I do plan on passing down to my children (not just daughters).

What he taught me was ""Just because one person did it doesn't mean everyone did it"" and ""just because they did it doesn't mean you have to"".

Also, that everyone is entitled to their beliefs. You don’t have to agree with them but don’t argue with them in public and don’t push your beliefs onto other people.  
Mum is a reasonably devout Christian and believes churches should welcome all as we are all sinners and let the one without sin throw the first stone... so she isn’t into worrying about what other people do in the privacy of their own home. Unless they don’t mow their lawns. If more religious people were into compassion and forgiveness, and living by example, the world would be a better place.",1
"My mom taught me this, too. Coupled with, “this too shall pass.”",1
"THIS has been passed down through the women in my family for generations. Sometimes stored in a vase, decorative pillow, or old coat pocket. Nothing worth a burglars time. Can be a life saver in hard times.",1
"Ok I see I got downvoted. It's not something my mother actively taught me or something I want to pass on to my daughters. It's something I saw my mum go through and made me look at myself in that light as a teen, am I skinny enough?
I'm now in the process of learning to love my body and I really really hope my daughter doesn't see the moments when I hate my body. I don't want her to hear me say I'm ugly and fat. I want her to celebrate her life and body and feel confident throughout her life. I just hope I haven't already ruined that for her",1
Compassion and forgiveness!! My two favorite things - which sometimes are the two hardest for me. But to be conscious of it and always try to be better is what matters ❤️,1
"Lol what is it with rednecks and discussing “when shit hits the fan”? I’m not saying it’s bad, it just seems like something we used to talk about in our family and I never hear it anymore! How we were lucky because we could always grow stuff if we needed to since we had land. We weren’t doomsday preppers or anything but the subject would come up in passing like that and there was a couple guns locked up in the basement “just in case.”",1
"For sure! 
Resume wise: you want it to be no longer than a page, and you want a fair bit of white space. It needs to be very easy to read. Reason being, your resume will probably come in a stack of others, and you want your qualifications to be clear in 30 seconds. My mom always said to assume it's being glanced at on a Friday at 5pm. You want them to put it in the 'follow up' pile instead of the trash. 

A lot of people highlight the place where they worked--highlight your job instead, again making it easy for the recruiter to see what you've done. A lot of people also add too much detail under what they've done in each job position. You need a one to two sentence description that both includes buzzwords for your profession (because nowadays we have to make it through a computer system before a person will even see your stuff), and it should be clear and concise. For example, I'm a nurse. When I edit resumes for colleagues, they include things like ""pass pills, take vitals"" in their description. The recruiter is aware that nurses pass pills and take vitals. That description is just extra, useless words. A better descriptor is ""Manage care for post surgical patients with an interdisciplinary team on a high volume unit. Experience with wound vacs and ventilators. Created a new report format and blood clot prevention form for the unit."" Now I have buzzwords (manage, care, high volume, interdisciplinary) and added experience others may not have and things I've done that go above and beyond. If they want to know more, they'll call me for an interview. 

I'd recommend a cover letter. And honestly I'd look up templates online for your job type, because it varies and I'm not as good with those.

When I go for an interview, I've looked up usual nursing interview questions online and practiced my answers. I'll also have three or four anecdotes I can use to make answers more personal. If they ask about my weakness, I tell them and then follow up with how I'm working on improving. At the end of the interview, I always tell the hiring manager that I want the job. My mom said that very few people told her that and it always left an impression. 

Hope this helps!",1
"I *was* the same and it took 10 years but honestly now I'm completely the opposite and you can be too. 

I learned from my mother and learned to be cruel in the worst ways to the people I love most. I consider it a gift though because now I think I'm even more compassionate and thoughtful in my communication than the average person. 

It took me a while but the only real guidance I can offer is learning to immediately acknowledge to yourself when you said something (or *how* you said something) with the intent of being hurtful. The second you recognize ""yeah, I did that just to make them react"" you can follow it up and an apology and rephrase, and then you'll slowly do it less and less, and you'll get better and better at assessing everything before it comes out of your mouth. I don't even think most people have to be *that* aware of their words (because they were never *that fucked up*) - but you will be and you'll be so grateful for it.",1
These made me tear up. My grandfather recently passed of lung cancer and he always told me how hard was to lose his mom at 17! He learned how to cook and clean and passed that to his kids,1
"Like I said in another comment - I think she meant it more about the pressuring to do something you don't like than the actual threesome.

However, my mom is from a different generation and isn't as liberal as it made her sound - she's insanely jealous and holds grudges like a fucking mythical creature. So yeah, she probably also meant no threesomes.

I've since surpassed my mother in emotional maturity and now understand that you can, in fact, have a threesome with a man who loves you - provided its part of your healthy, balanced relationship that you both want. 

The crux of it is the pressuring outside of your ""consent zone"" for his sexual pleasure.",1
"Same! For me nausea is not just miserable, it gives me really-not-funny feelings of existential dread and impending doom. One minute of barfing and I'm immediately cured - I actually look forward to it because I associate vomiting with relief.",1
"A horrible student was in my GCSE retake class. She had narrowly missed out on a passing grade in her exam so she put no effort into her work, thinking she’d ace the retake. She was surly and arrogant and belittled the EFL students in the class every lesson despite getting in trouble for doing so. We did a mock exam and when it was over she boasted about how easy it was in front of the rest of the class, telling them they must be idiots if they didn’t pass. When I marked the exams, she didn’t pass. She got almost the lowest possible grade. It took every ounce of self control I had not to laugh in her face. She was such a nasty person.",1
"My dad. He passed in August from an aggressive glioblastoma at 69 years old. He fought for 20 months after his diagnosis. 

My husband arranged for a book of his life to be compiled. My mother helped my dad recall his life story bit by bit over an entire year, taking notes once my dad couldn't hold a pen and guessing until he nodded once he couldn't speak.

My husband gave me the book for Christmas and I just got the courage this morning to read the first chapter.",1
"My mom who passed of a drug overdose 22 years ago. Our relationship was not always great but she did her best. At least she was there to see her first grandchild born before she passed 8 months later. 

My old boss, Vincent, who passed 4 years ago. He was a tough boss but a good man who by all rights should still be alive today. 

My Uncle Chris (who’s actually the uncle of a dear friend but I’m an adopted niece) who died of cancer last November and whose birthday was this past weekend. 

My friend/former colleague Billy, who died in his sleep at 45 years of age last summer. This one hurts BAD and is part of the reason I left nyc. Too many memories. 

A new* friend, John, who passed suddenly last summer after a car accident; he didn’t go to the hospital and died of internal bleeding. I’m so lucky to have met him and so sad that he’s gone. He was very young (27).

"I have a lot of recipes for curries that have been accumulated somehow and passed throughout the family, even though I'm Caucasian. They're all always well received and even my Indian/Pakistani friends ask for them.

I would tell you but it has been passed down through my family.,1

"I guess it depends on whether it's appropriate and if it's their business. 

If you want to share that with someone, you could just say ""I have X children now but I had one that passed away"".",1
"My mom always says three (originally two girls and one boy. But my brother passed away two years ago at age 29). 

She never goes into details. 

I also continue to say I have two siblings, one brother and one sister. If they ask for specifics like what do they do and how old they are I usually mention my brother has passed but he would be X years old and use to do XYZ.

It’s also interesting that I stumbled across this question because my brother has been really heavy on my mind this last week. But I don’t like to vent to my mom because she can’t even say his name without balling. She had to remove all of his pictures in the house and we cremated him so she keeps his box in her bottom dressing drawer with a towel over it. She has a really hard time coping when it’s mentioned so she usually doesn’t speak specifically about him.",1
"I don't have any children that passed away, but my mom lost her oldest child due to health issues.

She would say ""my oldest child Richard went to heaven x years ago. He would've been x years old if he was still alive.""


I'd say ""I have an older brother, but he passed away before I was born."" and go to details if needed.",1
"Usually when people ask how many children you have, theyre not referring to any that have passed. But thats usually because it wouldn't occur to them

If it were me, and fortunately it isn't, I would say ""I have x amount of children, and 1 in heaven"" or however it is

That way youre not leaving out the children who have gone but they also won't ask you questions as if they were still here which could get awkward. Its best to let people know i think, but also make a point that you like talking about them, if you do, or maybe that you dont",1

"Not necessarily a phrase but a situation. My grandpa, who I was very close with all my life was dying. My family told me he didn’t have much time left. I was alone at home (we lived together at the time) sobbing because the following day I was driving 4 hours to go visit him and say goodbye. My ex at the time was out with friends, when I texted him to “please come home, I don’t want to be alone right now” he replied with “why”

Secondary situation, my uncle passed unexpectedly a month later. Same scenario, he was out with friends, I was at home asking him to come home, he said “why”

I don’t know why it took me twice to shut that whole relationship down but he’s gone for good now",1

"When he figured out my password and broke into my accounts to read my conversations. I KNEW it was a red flag but I attributed it to his age. I should have broken up with him then. 

That guy ended up being the MOST emotionally exhaustive person I’d ever been with. I had to explain every single interaction I had with the opposite sex. You would think that after he read through my messages and didn’t find anything that he would have trusted me after that. Nope.",1
"i had been suicidal for the entirety of a 9 month relationship. around the 6 monthish mark, the mother of a friend passed away unexpectedly and it was very traumatic to my friend. i was talking about it to my boyfriend and was saying how awful my own life would be without my mother. (she was my carer at the time and still is). i said how i would hate to live without her. he looked me dead in the eyes and said ‘at the rate you’re going, you’ll be dead long before her’. that was the first time my heart had ever felt broken. i broke up with him a few months later but i wish i did it sooner.",1
"This reminds me of this I was hanging out with one of my friends and his girlfriend texted him, asking about something innocuous and non-urgent like ""what are your plans this weekend?"" Maybe 10 minutes had passed and he hadn't responded, because we were mid-conversation, so she texted him again with the same text IN ALL CAPS. He laughed it off but I've never understood why people tolerate that kind of thing.",1

"Reading that other women had a similar experience makes me feel so much more... Valid? Like I'm less of an idiot for letting someone on the opposite hemisphere control my whole life for 4 years. I was a teenager and was made to feel so guilty for doing things other teens were doing because that's the only time you can get away with reckless decisions and brush past their consequences. Like silly summer loves, growing up, experimenting with passions. He was older than me and had all those experiences already, which meant me being a kid was a punishable offence.

What an idiot I was for sticking around.",1
"I’ll start. My grandfather passed away today, but I will always remember the day last fall I drive down to visit him for lunch. He told me the story of how he got his name, introduced me to all his friends in his retirement home, and really took the time for us to talk in a way we’d never gotten to much before.

He was a wonderful person. I’m blessed to be his granddaughter.",1
"One of my best friends passed away about three weeks ago. This has by far been one of the most difficult times in my life. Despite the pain I am feeling, I hold onto our memories together close to my heart.

One of the fondest memories I have of her was when we were both in college and before we had our drivers license we would always travel out of our way every morning to get Starbucks. Eventually the employees at Starbucks would call us Trouble #1 and Trouble #2. I miss her everyday but I know one day I will meet her again.",1
"I'm so sorry for your loss. I lost my grandmother in January; she lived with us for most of my life. My favorite memories are of visiting her apartment when I was young (before she moved in) and her saving stale bread for us to feed the ducks at the lake near where she lived. I also loved when she played her oldies music in the car whenever she would pick me up from school and she would sing along (she was tone-deaf!). And my God, did she love John Wayne. I have probably seen every movie he's ever been in because of her. She would get so excited when his movies that she didn't own would come on TV on the Turner Classic channel, almost like a schoolgirl seeing her crush. After she passed, I held onto her John Wayne coffee mug. It's sitting on my shelf with her funeral mass card. She was a firecracker and a half and I miss her so much.",1
"I'm very sorry for your loss :( 

My great grandma used to make the best coffee I've ever had. Our whole family would gather every sunday to get some of it. I remember, even when she had trouble getting off the bed, she would make sure we all had our coffee on Sunday morning. My family moved to a different country. She passed away a few years later and my great grandfather told us that she would always make extra coffee in case we visited. Te extraño bisabuela.",1
"My maternal grandma died 17 years ago. I remember playing lots of games with her. She loved playing Yahtzee, bit even more than playing, she loved to win. It didn't matter if you were a kid, she would crush you while laughing. I miss her, but I still don't like playing Yahtzee. Haha. 

My paternal grandpa died 20 years ago. He lived on the other side of the country, so visits were rare. I have one specific memory of when he came out for my brother's wedding when I was 13. He took us all out to a fancy dinner and got a bit drunk. As we were leaving, I have him a hug goodbye and he whispered ""you're my favorite."" A moment later he pulled me back to whisper ""don't tell anyone."" I don't even care if he said that to everyone, it makes me smile to remember. 

My dad passed a year and a half ago. His health had been declining for over a decade, so it was a relief in the end to have him free from pain. Before he passed, though, he was able to be there to give me away at my wedding and he met and held my daughter. I have so many cheerful memories of him. He was a good man, and I miss him a lot. 

I'm so sorry for your loss. It's important to remember the moments we had with them and carry them with us into the future. As long as we carry the memories, we carry a part of them as well.",1
"My papa has been gone almost 16 years, but I'll never forget how kind he was. It was always little things, like sneaking extra sugar into our kool-aid because my grandma would only put a little bit in. He would give us little tasks to do and give us money for it, like we'd be peeling potatoes and he'd give us a dollar per potato. 

I had a great-aunt that I was super close with. She passed about 8 years ago. I will never forget her laugh and how much she loved to laugh. She loved to bake and would make hundreds of cookies every Christmas. I have a large family, but she knew everyone's favorite and would make a box for everyone. Near the end, she couldn't bake much anymore, but she still made my favorite cookies because I was her favorite. I miss her more than those delicious cookies. 

Finally...my dog. She passed away in March. It's silly, but she was deaf, so if I needed to wake her up, I had this stick I would gently poke her with. She would growl and then realize it was me and get this big goofy mostly toothless smile. I am convinced that there is not a dog that has lived that loved their owner as much as she loved me.",1

And he just covered the vomit with more snow. XD

Then we went inside and made colorful paper chains for the Christmas tree. 

He unfortunately passed of colon cancer the next year.",1
"I remember alot from my granny. Mostly how we would shell peas together as she watched her soaps and ""the judges"". The Price Is Right theme will forever be burned in my mind lol.. She also would tape church sermons with a tape recorder and listen to them later. Didn't understand it then, but as I've gotten older (I'm 28 now) I find it to be so amazing. She also gave great advice; it was always rooted in doing what was right. When I would visit her, I'd LOATHE being dragged around to all her elderly buddies' homes but the wisdom I was able to gain from such an early age!!! Didn't realize just how much of a privilege and advantage I had. She passed in 2017. I'll forever miss her. 

A friend of mine from high school who I lost touch with passed last year around February or March. No one told me so I couldn't pay my respects. My mom actually brought it up in casual conversation when I called home MONTHS after the fact. It hurt, like it cut deep because he was only maybe 3-4 years older than me. It was sudden and unsuspected, shocked the whole town because of how it happened. That memory will always remain; not being able to pay my respects. He was a fun loving guy too. Always found a way to make anyone laugh. I wear alot of caps now because he always wore caps. His smile could light up any room.",1

"This was something I dealt with almost 20 years ago (I'm turning 40 next week). My mother passed away from a very aggressive brain tumor, leaving her husband (my well-meaning but...problematic step-father). My biological father (whom I was still living with while I worked and went to school part time) had major mental and physical health problems of his own, and was just unable to live a functional adult life. As much as I tried, I couldn't do anything for either of them. Neither of them were were abusive, but as a young adult dealing with her own issues and trying to come into her own, I felt more and more and more like I needed distance if I had any hope of moving forward.

Ultimately, I was able to use the tiny bit of life insurance money I got from my mother's death to move out to Los Angeles with my girlfriend and try to start my adult life and career.

The emotional distance this created between me and my fathers was really unfortunate. Neither of them were together enough to keep in touch with me very much, and I was dealing with my own emotional baggage and wasn't able to either. So for the next decade it was just a phone call with my father maybe once or twice a month...and some kind of communication with my step-father once every few months (or less). I felt horrible about this, and ultimately their lives kind of spiraled into some really unhealthy places. But...again...there was nothing I could do to save them.

My father passed away from his health problems about 5 years ago. He had moved very far away, and my wife and I had to travel to the state he had lived in to pack up his belongings and wrap up all his affairs. I had never been there before. When we walked into his apartment it was just...horrid. His hording tendencies had gotten the better of him. There was filth everywhere, and his bedroom was full of old boxes...and a cat litter box with cat poop still in it even though his cat had passed away years ago. He had been sleeping on a cheap mattress on the floor in the living room next to a small TV I had bought for him...and surrounded by photos of me :(

I don't know if I'll ever not feel regret about this. My father loved me immensely, but was too unhealthy to be able to show it. Even in our infrequent communication, we had a connection that I'm still feeling the loss of. I wish I could have done more for him. But the truth is, I had mountains of traumas of my own to overcome. And only now that I'm on the cusp of 40, and with a beautiful 7 month son my wife and I adopted as a newborn, do I think I'm strong enough to be able to handle him. He just...wasn't able to live that long.

My step-father, I keep somewhat at arm's length. But I do try to keep in touch more than I did previously. He's not able to take care of himself either, but has caretakers in his siblings so I know I'll never have to face the choices with him that I did with my father.

I think, overall, I'm saying that sometimes these choices can be difficult. they might not be ""clean"". There will be regrets. You may question this stuff for the rest of your life. But, as with me, if your parents truly love you they'll understand and support you prioritizing your own health and happiness...even over theirs.",1
"When I was twelve years old my Nana’s boyfriend passed away. My cousin and I didn’t want her to be lonely so we decided to get her a bird. We didn’t have any money or means of transportation (as we were latchkey kids). We borrowed two ill fitted bikes and left at dawn to make enough money to buy our Nana a bird. We had decided early on that we would wash cars/windshields in order to earn enough money. We washed dozens of cars and by noon we had made $30. We then embarked on a ride across town to the Petco. When we got to the Petco the sales clerk schooled us on the realities of buying a bird, which included all the bells and whistles.  (No we didn’t factor in money for a cage, toys, treats, or food/water dishes). We realized we only had enough money for 1 parakeet and a small bag of seeds. Also we were on our bikes and there was no way we would make it home with everything in hand (My feet barely touched the pedals!). Clearly we were children that did not think this completely through. The sales clerk asked us why we wanted the bird and our story touched them. They offered to get/buy us a cage and give us a discount on the food dishes... all we had to do was give them all our cash. They agreed to drop everything off to the house after their shift. We then raced home before it got too dark and waited. Several hours had passed and we feared we had been duped, but alas a knock at the door, it was the sales clerk with TWO parakeets and all the goods!!! It felt like such an amazing adventure at the time. I still think about riding our bikes into a dust cloud kicked up by a passing semi on our way to Petco hell bent on buying Nana a parakeet.",1
"D e p r e s s i o n 

My life wasn't my own as much as it was one of my parent's, which meant I grew super super depressed trying to make it in that world. Of course, friends save the day, but...I was not living how I wanted to live - and that can only be hidden for a little bit before it starts leaking out in your day-to-day existence. 

My ass should've been on medication and free to *choose* what I really wanted to do, as well as aided from my divorced and narc parents. 

Being on medication now helps a lot, and the difficulties of being a high schooler then have passed a lot since then. I learned that I'm smarter than I know and so are most people, high school and teenagery is just unfair and fucked up in (American) society",1
"My papa’s funeral. While it was sad, he had been struggling with Alzheimer's for the last 10 years of his life. It was putting a huge strain on my nana, my dad and his siblings. When he passed away, it was like everyone could breathe again. The funeral also was like a family reunion and we reminisced about the good times in our childhoods and had lots of laughs.",1
"My dad's best friend passed away out of nowhere in 2015, literally a *week* after he came camping at the top of Scotland with us.

I miss him now.",1
"One of my good friends passed away due to complications from an illness she’d had her whole life. It was simultaneously the saddest and happiest funeral I’d ever been to. She was a beautiful girl with a happy spirit, so we tried to honor her in the same way. We all wore yellow (her favorite color) to the service, brought all yellow followers, and sang her favorite songs. Her sister told funny stories about her, it was beautiful really. I think she would have liked it.",1

"My grandma just passed away in October. A few months before she died, we found her life story that she had hand written back in 1995 which chronicled her life up until that point. She made the comment that whenever she died, it would sure be nice to have someone read it at her funeral. I volunteered to do it thinking I had quite a while to prep. However the time came much too soon. I got up there and read 19 pages of her life to everyone in attendance. We laughed, we remembered, and we cried, it was the most happiest and memorable funeral I’ve ever attended.",1
"When my Grandma passed, rather than a funeral, we gathered in her apartment. Just the women of the family were there, and we made her famous cinnamon buns and played her country tapes and laughed and reminisced and giggled and cried. We all wore pink, which was her favorite colour.  It was perfect. She would have loved it. Miss you Grams 💖💓",1
"2016, when my brothers gf passed away from crohns. It was raining pretty hard that day. During the service almost everyone who went up, including my brother, told great memories that made us all laugh. My son was around 3 and while he didn't fully understand what was going on, he helped with the laughter and love that filled the room. Once the service was done, the rain let up and the the sun started to poke out from the clouds while we were at the cemetery. It really was a beautiful funeral.",1
"My grandma passed away a few years ago, and she always said that when she goes she just wants to be cremated and her ashes spread out at her favourite spot. I don't know how it is in other places but throwing away human ash is considered littering where I am from and is highly illegal. Usually the remains are handed out in a urn with a vacuum sealed hard plastic bag inside that goes into a wall you can visit.  Anyways, after the memorial service, around 13 of us went to Grandma's fav spot, which also happened to be a popular hiking place for people. 

My family is a very ""sharing is caring"" type, so they decided that everyone gets a turn at spreading grandma's ashes, so whenever someone turn started my mom and aunt would loudly say ""makes sure there will be enough for everyone"". In the mean time it's around -10 degrees, people are walking their dogs, there are some serious hikers nodding hello, while my cousin, last in line to spread her,  just realises that more than half of grandma is  left in the bag. It was so comical that everyone was so contemplative, saying goodbye, crying and remembering how great this woman was, and then my mom and aunt start discussing if we should just do another round of spreading her, because ""it's only fair"". 

Meanwhile,  my brother and i just started laughing hysterically because my grandma would have called us idiots for going through so much trouble, we are freezing our asses off, looking out to see if anybody has called the police/rangers, and my cousin is still pouring everything out of the bag halfway screaming: ""it's okay now, you are free, you were so small, how is this even possible??""

Then we all went home, had a beer, ending a difficult and sad  day on a happy note. It's a memory that is funny and sweet, which is so fitting to how my grandma was. Damn, I miss her so much.",1
"My step mom did an assisted suicide after a long battle with ALS. She had a celebration of life, we were all drinking mimosas and crying with her, it was really beautiful. She passed away with all of us around watching the sunset from her favorite spot in the house. It was sad, but so meaningful.",1
"My grandma and grandpa went to the same restaurant every day of the week. Except the restaurant was closed on Sundays so they went somewhere else on Wednesdays. They did this for years.

When my grandma passed away each restaurant sent flowers to the funeral home. Neither restaurant wanted to be outdone by the other so they kept sending more and more. It turned into a turf war of flowers. We couldn't stop laughing every time more flowers were delivered.

Also, a lady showed up to the wake wearing the same outfit my grandmother was wearing in the casket. My brother and I took a poll of who wore it better.",1
"My grandpa passed away close to Thanksgiving, but he knew he was going to pass. He asked his kids to have a memorial for him in Cinco de Mayo. He loved spending time in Mexico and my grandma was from Ensenada; she passed at a young age, but she was the love of his life. He wanted us to have a celebration of life for him and my grandma since they would finally be together again. My aunts and mom made a ton of tamales, carne asada, spanish rice, homemade refried beans, barbacoa, and lots of other mexican dishes using my grandma's recipes. My uncle hired a mariachi band and tended bar that day. There was lots of joy, laughter, reminiscing, and love. I got to see pictures of my grandma with my grandpa, him in his Marine dress uniform and her in a traditional mexican wedding dress with lace frills and a train that went on forever. We drank margaritas and danced to the mariachi music, we talked and laughed, drank and ate until we were bursting at the seams. It was a wonderful day.",1
"I work as a personal trainer for cancer patients. Several years ago I had a client go down hill very quickly. I saw her in the hospital a week before she passed. She knew I loved high heels, so she made me promise to wear my tallest sexiest heels to her funeral. I honored her wish and at her very religious, Christian funeral I wore shiny black very sexy open toed 5” heels. I could almost hear her chuckling at me. I still miss her.",1
"My friends mom passed away right before our senior year in high school. It was incredibly sad, she was really young (heart complications) and we were all upset at the funeral. Their house was always where we went to hang out. Her parents let us sleep over and have a few parties and stuff. (Not like ragers or anything but like 5 or 6 of us at a time)

Anyway, we had tons of memories at the funeral. We had a lot of fun there. The kids and friends mostly stayed outside so we weren’t actually disrupting the grieving but we still talk about that day a lot and I know her mom wouldn’t have cared. I miss that woman a lot.",1
"Probably my MIL a few years ago. She had a really long journey with cancer: she had undergone another round of chemo and radiation  she was told she was 'in the clear' by her doctors, and passed about 6 months later. Her passing was incredibly difficult on my husband and our extended family. Especially as she decided to pass at home where she was more comfortable (with a few equipment rentals). 

Their family is SUPER Catholic (not a judgement, just a fact) and you could see how much peace the ability to convene and pray as a community helped start the grieving process. My husband delivered her eulogy and helping him prepare for it was cathartic for certain. One of the uncles hosted a small get together following the service and we ended up sitting in the sun, drinking margaritas (mom's celebratory drink of choice) and sharing stories.",1
"My great-aunt died a few years ago, her quality of life was almost non-existent at the end. When I heard about her death, I was relieved. My grandma's cat died a few weeks before, I had more tears for her than for my great-aunt.

She taught piano to many children in her village and she wasn't a very nice teacher. 6 people at her funeral altogether, including 4 family members who ""had"" to be there.

The pastor mispronounced her name a few times. He told us of her good nature and her helpfulness. We giggled all the way through. The meal afterwards was a celebration. When our hostess came to tell us her sympathies and we told her who died, she couldn't hold back her grin.

You see, my great-aunt used to beat each and every last one of her pupils, my mum included, but everyone in town wanted for their child to be a musician or at least play one instrument, so they sent their kids to her. Also, beating a child was permitted then (it isn't now). Since she died in her late 80s and not much of that generation is left in town, everyone hated her. I think some of them danced on her grave. She was a miserable old woman who liked making others miserable as well.",1
I have my first dog's name tag on my keyring. He passed in 2007.,1
"I don't keep this on me because I'm scared I'll lose it or my bag will get stolen but in my closet, I have my dad's wallet that still has everything in it from 2004 when he had a heart attack and died that night.  The hospital staff emptied his pockets and his wallet was one of the personal items they gave back to us.  In that wallet, are his bus tickets, his license, cash and the worn-out paper with our cell phone numbers written on them.  I take those things out once in a while to look at them; just thinking about that, even after all these years, still makes me cry (like now 😥)",1
Pictures of me and mother in my purse she passed away when I was 15 but I feel like I have her with me.,1
A rosary my grandpa gave me before he passed away.,1
A keychain my mom got me from North Carolina when I was 7. My grandfather had passed away so she flew over for his funeral. It may just be a keychain but I feel like I always have my grandfather with me. I love it.,1
"My Dad was always old, so I grew up my whole life knowing he might pass away while I was young. So I prepared by spending as much time with him as possible, and asking him all sorts of questions about his life etc. He passed away from cancer when I was 19, and I had alot of closure because i grew up living like this.

But there is always going to be the one more question or one more moment you wish you could have. It's always small things like, I'll remember a memory he told me, but now I want to know the finer details like what year was that, what else happened etc....or I'll have a dream of him, and I'll go to hug him but I'll wake up. Its moments like that my heart hurts but I'm just super grateful I got to know my Dad.",1
"Nothing that I wish I had asked in particular but I wish that I had said 'I love you'. 

My family is not the best with emotional expression. 

I'm sure he knew but it would have been nice for him to hear it. 

He passed away last year suddenly from cardiac arrest.",1
"I wish I would have asked for more recipes. He suddenly passed a few years after my grandmother (his mom) died and we lost a lot of family recipes that were never written down. I'm a decent baker and can get close to the same cookies and such, but it'll never be exactly as I remember. 


My dad was never one to be in photos. I only have a handful of them between my high school graduation and his passing 6 years later, one of which is from my grandmother's funeral. I'd love to have more pictures of and with him. 


Because my parents had been divorced for a few years at that time, I also wish we would have known where his important info was as a general precaution. Bank accounts, life insurance, cash, mortgage info, etc. was not easy to find and that's a big deal when someone is gone unexpectedly.",1
"That's a really good one. I dreamt the other day of my grandpa who's passed away, trying to take a picture with him to have one last souvenir, it broke my heart.",1
"I have a few things in mind, but there's one story I thought of that fits this.

Months before the pandemic, I had taken a trip to the local library where they had new, used and old library books half off what they usually sell them for. One was a new book I got because I had read a book by the same author and the other was a book I hadn't seen in a long time. It was a book called ""Storybound"" and it was a book I read in middle school about a girl who gets transported to a world of fairy tales. It was the first of two books, but the first book was the only one I read and the only one there so I bought it. I've read it a few times for nostalgia, but I bought it to add to my collection of books I want to pass down to my kids. Right with my other old books from middle and elementary school.",1
"Sentimental jewelleries & journals.

I would also like to save some aspects of my culture and the cooking to pass onto my children.",1
"I have a necklace from my grandmother that I hope to pass down.  We were very close, and I’m sad they’ll never get to meet her.",1
My dad gave me his yes in the round shirt from 1969 and a grateful dead tank from the 80s that I cherished. Some trashy girl I went to high school with had a junkie friend of hers at her house and stole them while I was babysitting her damned kid. That was like 15 years ago and I'm still passed about it!!!,1
"I think this anecdote counts.

I was at the grocery store at the busiest time. This man in his 50's was blocking the path and kind of walking backwards while he said hi a friend over his shoulder. I said, ""Excuse me,"" because I couldn't get past him. It was loud enough for him to hear, but he ignored me. So I shouldered my way past him. After I passed, he said, ""mumble-mumble-mumble, ya cold ass bitch!"" By the time it registered what he'd said I was an aisle and a half away. I spun around and said, ""HEY! I said 'excuse me,' but *you* didn't move! That's no reason to call me a BITCH!""

 Like I said, it was the busiest time, so 10-15 people witnessed that interaction. He didn't say anything more (what could he say?) and I went about my shopping.",1
"My mother adopted a cat a few years before I was born, and he was my constant companion until he passed when I was in middle school.  He was a lazy, dumb cat (the best kind) who didn't mind being carried around or dressed in doll clothes.  He slept in my crib when I was a baby, and continued to sleep in my bed every night.  When he got too old and sick to jump into bed, I slept on the floor with him.",1
He was a guinea pig. He was mostly very shy. He passed away because he got out once and spent the whole time eating my plastic dollhouse. :(,1
"That sounds like a great way to get somebody's passwort security question ;) 

But seriously: we had a female abyssinian guinea pig in caramel and white. I know you're not supposed to keep them singular but I was seven or eight and my mom said so. She was allowed to roam the apartment freely all day and would come to the sofa to lick our feet. However, she would only walk on carpet because she didn't like how her little feet slipped on hardwood floors.

When she wasn't even a year old, my dad stepped on her. My mom rushed her to the vet, while my dad stayed home feeling immensely guilty. She broke her hip but the vet said she'd make it. And she did and died at the ripe age of nine years. Which is rather old for guinea pigs. 

She was a good pig and had all of the cute habits – whistling when she heard us using the salad dryer and answering with a deep sound when we slapped our thighs. She also loved cucumber peels and parsley. She especially loved eating the fringes of our parents' persian rugs. My mom tried to stop her, rubbing them in perfume samples. But when it wore off, she'd be back at it again.",1
"Trigger Warning (TW): I will mention medical infections, operations and pet passing. It's quite a sad story, honestly.

My first pet was a Persian cat. He was such a wonderful and quiet animal. He did not need to talk nor make a sound, his presence was calming enough. I loved him with my entire being. I'll always say he used all of his 7 lives and did not waste a single one. He lost an eye when he was young because of an infection. Then a year before his passing, he was staying with my grandma while we were on vacation, he got disoriented and fell from a window, four floors onto the ground. Luckily the only thing he broke were his front paws. 

He accompanied me during most of my school years, high school and during my senior years. Sadly, we had to put him down because when he fell, he probably also hit his chin onto the ground, which caused him to get one of his tooth so infected it literally started eating him from inside out. As he was really old and weak we could not operate him because the chances of him passing on the operation table were very high. The only thing we could do is let him live as much as he wanted to live.

I remember begging him when he was already weak to survive to see me get into my dream college, and he did. He lived for seven more months when his life expectancy was two weeks max. The same day we put him down I got the results of my university entry exam. I got in. 

I still miss him everyday. But he taught me many valuable lessons and helped me get through very hard times mentally and I will be forever thankful.",1
"My first pet outside of family pets was my dog Kelsie. She was a shih tzu/poodle. Sadly, she passed away a little under a year ago. 

She was such a great little dog with a huge personality. She was a yappy little thing and did not like strangers, but man did that dog love me. Kelsie was deaf for the latter half of her life. She also survived cancer at the young age of 7. She absolutely loved cats. When we brought our kitten home, she would cry if the kitten wasn't in her sight. She also really loved kids, especially one of my nieces and my son. 

She was there with me when I had my kid, during my worst breakup, and stuck around just long enough for me to get married. She was there to cuddle away any sadness. If I cried, she would immediately jump on my lap and comfort me. The night before she died, she was having trouble walking. She could barely get out of her bed, but she got up so she could find a spot to stare at me. She just laid there and stared at me for a couple hours. I think she knew her time was up, even if I didn't know it at the time. 

I miss her so much.",1
A golden retriever. He was a loving and protective good doggo. It’s been more than 10 years since he passed away and I still miss him.,1
"It was a couple of years ago, at Christmas. We were all gathered at my parents' house. For some reason I just couldn't sleep, so I got up and wandered downstairs to find my brother still up as well, wrapping presents for his daughter at like 2 am. I sat down and helped him out. Then we watched Mom and Dad Save The Planet and Jingle All The Way. At one point we were both hungry, so he got up and made us waffles with peanut butter and syrup. We just sat and laughed and smoked outside, just the two of us, enjoying each other's company in the tiny hours of Christmas morning, waiting for everyone else to get up.

He passed away 18 months ago. So that memory is even more precious to me, and when I'm truly missing him I make myself remember when we sat on the couch together, holding the plate of santa cookies and arguing over which of us would be able to take the most perfect bite of a cookie so my niece would know that santa had enjoyed them.",1
"One night I was tucking my brother (7) and my sister (4) into bed and reading them a bedtime story. I'm 23 and live away for college so always made a point of tucking them in when I was home.

I was wedged between the two of them in their bed after finishing a story (they slept together every night), my little sister rolled over and fell asleep. When we realised she was asleep, my brother and I gave each other a knowing glance, turned to each other and started cuddling, limbs intertwined. We both said 'I love you', and he just looked at me with the most beautiful expression I have ever seen, with complete and utter love and happiness. He cupped my face with his little hands and I rubbed his back.

I'll never forget how I felt at that moment. Two months later he passed away in his sleep, unexpectedly. He was my best friend and showed me the true meaning of love. It will always be the most precious moment in my life.",1
"man my precious memories stem from dark places. let's see.... well one was like 4 years ago. I was laying in bed having a really bad day with my depression not able to get out of bed. My SO insisted I just lay there and not worry about a thing and just left me alone and took over with the kids. My son who was almost three at the time managed to get pass her. He waddled his way to my room and asked what was wrong. Told him nothing was wrong mommy just felt really really sad and just needed to get some sleep. He looked around and found one of his starter books on my floor from when I read to him the other night and picked it up and crawled into bed with me and say. ""K well i read mommy story for bed time."" He then made sure I was tucked in and cuddled up and read me a story before giving me a kiss on the head and getting caught in the room by my SO. I explained he was reading mommy a story for nap time and she hauled him off telling him to let her now before he runs off like that again. Then got him excited to watch my little pony with his sister with the promise he could watch team umi zoomi or blippi after. it really put into perspective how important little things like his bedtime routine was to him and how it made him feel and how special it was to him.",1
"When I just graduated high school my parents filed bankruptcy and we lost everything. We had to move from our big house in a nice neighborhood to a small one bedroom apartment next to a strip club. We lost our two cars and had to take the bus everywhere. A family of 7 sharing a 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom, with a kitchen so small you could put you hands on either wall, you would think this would be awful but it was the best 2 years in my families' life. We smiled and laughed all the time, we were grateful that we even had a place and that we were together. The engery in that small little apartment was so positive we even had friends ask to stay the night and more with us. We took turns sleeping in the bed, I slept in the closet most of the time. 

We had lost everything but having all those material things kept us apart. Losing it brought us closer together. To this day, I pass that little apartment on my way to my condo on the beach, I look at it and smile, grateful they haven't torn it down yet. The strip club was torn down by the way. Since then I've lost my mom to cancer, my dad to illness, and my sister to drugs but I still have those 2 years ingrained in my memory.",1
My time with the grandpa on both sides before they passed away. The people who believed in me when I felt like I deserved nothing.,1
"My kitty passed away just a month and a half ago. I can completely relate. I had to put her to sleep (cancer). It was the hardest decision I ever made in my life. I will never have a pet again because even though I had 14 wonderful years with her, the pain of losing her was/is too unbearable.",1
"You SMASHED it! Passing must have been a big confidence boost. 


Greater things await!",1
"I’m so sorry to hear about your kitty, too. Mine was put to sleep, too (he had a stroke) and it’s horrendous isn’t it? I was not ready to say goodbye to him. You probably feel the same as me - gone way before their time 💖💖",1
"I come from a tiny European town and we live in three generation homes, so I grew up with one set of grandparents living in the same house as me. They picked me up from day care with their bikes, cooked me lunch, played with me, watched TV, took me on walkes with our dog, tucked me in at night when my parents were out. When I went off to university I hopped on a two hour long train ride to visit them every weekend. And when they passed away it was the worst pain I had and have ever felt. 

I promised to visit their grave as often as possible, and I do. I live on a different continent now, but I try to be there multiple times a year. I also keep in contact with their siblings and I have their pictures and wedding bands. Thinking about getting a tattoo to honor them.",1
"Hmm, my grandparents on my mom’s side are Japanese so I never really got to speak to them much as I didn’t know the language growing up. Regardless, my grandpa and I had a good relationship as we bonded over sports and the dream that I’d study in Japan. My grandma and I are closest as we bonded over lots of things such as cooking and baking, comedies, art, and more. She’s a very gentle and patient soul that never fails to cheer me up with her good company and yummy food. Although she also wants me to come study in Japan so she’s been urging me to pick up Japanese lately😅

My grandparent’s on my dad’s side are from the States and have both passed long ago. I never got to meet my grandfather since he passed before I was born but I’ve heard a lot about him and really admire him. My grandmother was a very kind and quick-witted woman who taught me a lot. She also always had the best games (video games/sports/etc), answers to my many questions, bandages to patch me up, my favorite cereals stocked up, and a witty comeback for anyone and everyone.

I miss them a lot but I’ll be sure to make many more good memories with my grandma!!😁",1
"When I was little, we would always all get together at some point in the summers in Maine and I would see them. They were both always really nice to me and I had no complaints. Eventually though they didn't want to keep flying out to Maine so instead we started visiting them in their home in California.  They passed away in 2011 and 2018.",1
"My maternal grandma pretty much raised me, she passed 10 years ago and I miss her every day. My grandpa died before I was born.

Paternal grandparents, no relationship at all. I see my grandma every few years and the dude that's supposed to be my grandfather hasnt seen my face in 30 years.",1
"Basically non existent

My paternal grandparents loved me,  but were too poor and sick to visit me,  and we couldn't afford to visit them.  They wrote me letters, and I got to see them in person 3 or 4 times in my life before they died when I was a teen.  I really enjoyed my time with them,  but I don't have many memories.  I wish I could have gotten to know them.  

My maternal grandparents apparently had no interest in me whatsoever. I don't remember them ever making an effort to visit me,  have me visit them,  write to me,  call me.  That was especially sad,  because they both lived into my mid thirties,  so I lost a lot of time in a different way.  I remember hearing my grandmother had passed,  and my first thought was how inconvenient it was going to be to attend her funeral. Which is awful. But she was a stranger to me.  

An elderly widower lived across the street from me when I was a kid.  He had no grandchildren of his own,  and he adopted me and my siblings.  He accompanied me to my school's annual grandparents luncheon,  which I had never been able to attend before.  He brought me flowers.  He never forgot my birthday. He walked me home from school when he was feeling up to it. He died at the age of 102. I got to be with him. He was my real grandfather.

Edit: wow I haven't cried for Old Ed in almost thirty years,  but here I go.",1
I was close to both sides. My Dad farmed two farms and his parents lived on one. My maternal grandparents lived 20 minutes away and I visited a lot with my Mom. They all passed before I was 20.,1
"Two of my grandparents passed before I was born, but the remaining two are/were polar opposites (my grandfather passed a few years ago).

My grandfather loved me to pieces; it was no secret that I was the favorite grandchild (and he didn't have many). He loved hearing my stories, seeing my art projects, laughed when I loudly blurted out an opinion, watched movies/TV with me just to see what my world was. I was 11 the last time I saw him, and then his health started failing and his wife (not my grandmother) went out of her way to distance him from my family. He was not the nicest of people- but he loved me, so my relationship with him and memories are very complex. He passed while I was in college and I couldn't get time off work to go to the funeral; I am furious at him for some things he used to say to my mom, but I'm also a little sad that he never got to see me graduate from college or meet my BF. It was complex. But I know he loved me.

My grandma, on the other hand, is still alive. And hates me. Mostly because I am my mother's daughter and she hates my mom for the simple reason that is: My mom is not Catholic. Yeah. It's ah... A very weird thing, especially since my mom and I are Christian's, just not of the Catholic variety (before someone comes at me and asks did we do anything to insult her, no- my grandma tried to insist that my mom convert when my parents first got married, she said no, and for that my grandma has always hated her). So, I've been called an illegitimate child to my face and it used to really upset me. Doesn't anymore but it was hella annoying for a while. Oh, and she swears she's also the reincarnation of a holy figure in the Catholic church and gets very upset when people question her about that. Doesn't help also that while she despises me and calls me every insult in the book, she adores my sister and they have so much fun together.",1
"My mom's father died when I was 11 years old. Before that we had a pretty good relationship with them. After the death my already strange and cold grandma turned even colder. I don't have a need to stay in touch with her and she is not interested in my life either.

With my father's side I had a rather formal relationship. We visited there every two months. But my mother kept telling all this bs about them all the time so I was afraid as a child to trust them or have a close relationship. 

Later in teenage I realised the problem was my mother, not other people. I started bonding more with my father's mother. My father's father was a man of few words so we didn't talk much. But he was ok. He passed away in an accident last year. I keep in touch with my father's mother every once in a while. I live in another country now so we send messages on whatsapp. We are not super close but she is supportive and I sense she wants the best for us. Even though sometimes she's expecting too much.

Overall grandparents or relatives are not that important for me. My mom made sure to spoil every relationship we had to her side of family. And my father's side is just very... restrained I guess?",1
I try to make sure first that the attractive person really is getting a pass because of their looks and I'm not being biased. I don't like people who just assume automatically that someone got a pass without actually looking into it. Then I make a note inside my head of people who gave the pass and try to distance myself from those people. I don't distance myself from the attractive person unless I know for sure that the attractive person is using their looks to get a pass.,1
"As an average white person who loves cooking anything and everything, I'll just pass on recipes.",1
"Family bond. I grew up in a very close knit family.  Aunts, uncles cousins. A lot of the time a lot of us under one roof.  My family has always been the one consistent good thing in my life.",1
"Lunar new year and mid autumn festival celebration with mooncakes. Making dumplings/wontons and family style meals. Some of my fondest memories with my family is when we make a large batch of food together. Also our enjoyment of all kinds of fruit.

Also our love for the outdoors, not really from our culture but more of how we bond as a couple. We definitely will pass this onto our kid.",1
"If I ever have kids, I hope I could pass on family recipes. I think recipes are a nice story of where your family has come from (my grandparents were born in the US, but they grew up on recipes from their grandparents who were from other countries, and we still use them).

I also hope to pass on Halloween.",1
"5 Years later he messaged me and apologized for everything. I can tell he wants to prove to me he's changed but, so many years have passed. I don't have the same taste, I have no feelings for him anymore. Didn't open old wounds, it was healing knowing that I know I'd never be with him again lmao",1
"Yes. We had met up six months after the breakup. It was my first time seeing him in person. He wanted to say goodbye because he was moving across the country. (California). A lot inside of me thought he were going to eventually get back together. We spent three hours at the restaurant catching up. In the end I broke down crying saying I was scared I’d never find someone I’d love as much as him and he kind of reassured me before making a cocky ass statement about how he set the bar really high and how it probably would be hard for me. The sad part is that I believed him. I kept some contact in some sick way of still wanting to be apart of his life. It wasn’t healthy for me in any way. And I did a lot of the reaching out and him gently ignoring me. 

Eventually (ONE AND A HALF YEARS LATER) I moved on. Blocked him. And didn’t say anything else on my way out. About a year after I unblocked him. He actually reached out to me two months ago (it’s been over three years now) and I got a quick whiff of why I was okay with moving on. 

He was a really cocky dude. A lot of the “catching up” was his way to display how amazing his life is and how he’s doing. There was a lot of emphasis on that which makes me feel like if you have to emphasize that, then you’re probably not having a good time lol. 

I kind of just let him speak and then he ended the conversation with him going to bed (I barely got a three words in) lol. But that’s about it. deep down I still feel a sting of betrayal. But I think about what my brother told me in the midst of this chaotic breakup, that you’ll always love that person deep down and that the feeling of being hurt is always there but with time you’ll learn how to cope and manage the hurt better. (Ironically my brother passed away two years ago and now I use this advice towards him)

I’m a million times better. No contact is the hardest but best way to go. 

So yea. Crazy times 😂

12/10 would not do that again lol",1
"Considering I'm a very lazy individual, smoking weed & napping. If I wanted to feel productive and pass time, however, cleaning is a great way to eat away time!",1
Reading is the best way to pass time,1
"Most of my friends are far away so those relationships are pretty unchanged-some I've gotten to talk to more as we have more downtime but like the ones I have a regular call or zoom schedule with that hasn't changed. My one good friend in the area who lives alone and is taking COVID as seriously as I am and I have gone on a few hikes, which is nice to get out of the house. The thing I'm really missing is more surface level/passive interactions, like sitting in a coffee shop or even playing sports. They can wait, though.  


I've also taken up a few new hobbies and improved my cooking skills. I can knit now and make a damn good vegan carbonara.

&#x200B;

That said I don't get along with my roommate and she told me that ""mature adults don't feel lonely"" when I mentioned working from home was getting old so it's been almost more isolating in that respect than living alone.",1
"There are so many ways to stay in touch virtually, and that is all well and good, but I have also found focusing on what I do to pass the time when not talking to friends is so important for me. Doing things that engage my mind like reading or listening to interesting podcasts or working out or even cleaning my house etc help me pass the time and forget I’m alone while sitting down and watching tv every free moment really amplifies the loneliness to me. So just balancing out my time has been helpful.",1
"As long as I wouldn't die by asphyxiation on the way up and I had a parachute, I'd go all the way. The universe is a beautiful thing, why pass the opportunity to experience it? Life is too short to pass up experiences like that, and I've always been one for astronomy.",1
"Super annoyed. But it's better than quiet, mean, passive aggressive comments.",1
"I don’t care. I don’t find yelling intimidating by itself. Don’t cuss at me, do not ever physically intimidate (let alone touch) me but yelling? Won’t help you make your case but whatever. 

I suppose it would bother me if it happened in public, or now that we have a child if it happened where he could hear it - though my husband is the quiet angry type, so no personal experience with that.

I can’t say I get why people are so up in arms about this (traumatic experiences exempted), I’ll take a yeller over passive aggression any day of the week. But that’s just me 🤷🏻‍♀️",1
"I don't think it's an inherently less mature to yell vs to entirely shut down (I personally am less bothered by yellers because shutting down feels like a weird power flex to me in which they have sole control over whether the issue is going to be solved). Both are emotional regressions that frankly everyone is entitled to once and a while as reactions to pain, grief, bad situations, etc.

Anger is a human emotion and it's very weird to say that experiencing it is wrong or bad or try to police how other people feel pain. I think it's extremely inappropriate that people pass judgments on other's intelligence based on how they react to pain-if their reaction is harmful to you, it's on you to leave the situation-and that goes for any reaction.  


If someone is screaming at a coworker for like misplacing a pen, yeah that's inappropriate to the situation and not great (although I'd say most of the time that's not the problem and there's something else going on there).",1
i deal and wait for it to pass later silently judging their character and lack of self control. unfortunately this would be my mother.,1
I automatically categorize them as (emotionally) stupid. Sometimes I infantilize them because it’s my passive aggressive way of getting back at them for being ridiculous.,1
"The only time I think its ever warranted is when someone is talking over someone who refuses to shut up. You know the talkative people who talk but when its someone else turn they interject and talk over them. 

For those that yell immediately over the silliest stuff like something dropping by accident, or someone asking whats wrong and gets an aggressive response to hell with those types because they piss me off the most. If they do it consistently its verbal abuse to me at that point. I keep my distance with these types of people because if I blow up right back I don't feel that great about it. Almost want to fight that person, to avoid that feeling I might give my two thoughts and hurry up and go to a different location space to calm down. As long as they don't follow me or continue yelling it might be fixable. If its not fixable, ill always tell them bye.",1
"If it's rare... I get it. It happens. We're all human. It's not OK to shame someone for it.

If it's common? I cant really be around that. It's draining. I still wont shame them or anything, but it's not my thing. I wouldn't be able to put up with a yeller as a partner for damn sure lol. I'd just think they're emotionally childish if it's persistent.",1
"God, same. My parents still do this and it's infuriating. My partner wanted that type of relationship and I was a hard pass on that.",1
I'd take some yelling (light though) over passive aggression too lol and I had trauma around it... but I obviously still prefer emotionally mature.,1
"I'm sorry for the loss of your boy. Pets give us thousands of wonderful days and one really, really shitty one.

I have a memorial plaque in my house. Whenever a pet passes away, I write their name on it. It's prominently displayed, so every time I walk by it, I tend to see at least one name. And then I force myself to remember a good memory of them.

I also sometimes go back through old photos, if they're available. Unfortunately for awhile there I was really bad at taking pictures, so I don't have many, but I can still look back through the ones I have and smile as I remember how cute/funny/affectionate they were. 

Also, when I feel the time is there, I'll start looking for a new baby. The loss of a pet is always terrible, but I like to think of it as making room in my home for another pet who deserves a forever home as well. Not a replacement, nothing can ever replace a beloved pet, but there's now space for another member of my silly furry family.",1
"I absolutely fell apart for a good 6 months after one of my cats passed back in 2018. Probably took a full year to completely recover. He was my emotional support animal and we'd bonded incredibly strongly, plus he was my first cat.

Part of me recovering was getting kittens. I know it doesn't work for everyone, but I needed that energy in my life.",1
"Don't really have anything to add because the only time I had a pet was when I was very young, and I don't have too many memories about him (he was a dog, and died pretty soon).

But... I grieve a lot about cherished pets from my friends that end up passing away. Somehow, I feel very attached to them, and when my friends end up telling me that something came to happen to their pets, I can't help but feel terribly filled with sadness.

I remember this cat (he was called Fred) that my friend would always take pictures of to show me. He didn't have a home apparently, so my friend took him in. The kitty was just so cute, always with a sleepy face on, barely open eyes, and he had huge, adorable paws. I soon felt like he was my own cat. And one day when I heard that he got hit by a car and died... I got so sad, powerless, but also very mad with my friend for letting him out in the streets. The thought of never seeing him again, even though I didn't interact with him too much, in a way made me feel like I had lost something very important to me. I wanted so much to shout ""why didn't you take better care of him?!""

It probably can't compare to having lived with a pet for more than 10 years like some people do, but I guess my love for animals and their different personalities is one of the most genuine feelings I've experienced. And if I did have a pet... I can't even imagine how much I'd cry if they died, lol.",1
"I also got kittens, about 9 months after my first cat passed away (I adopted him when he was six and he lived to be 21, so I had a lot of time with him). 

I live by myself and besides missing him I suddenly had to deal with living in a truly empty home and I totally needed more cat energy in my life, but it took a good 6 months before that didn't feel like 'betraying' my old cat.",1

">if your grade was unrelated to competency/material mastery?

These are related to competency as a student. 

If I've done poorly in a necessary course, I retook the class and used all of the resources the college offered to pass it successfully.",1
"I failed my first statistics exam and passed the course with the lowest possible passing grade (pretty sure the TA took pity on me). I now have a PhD in psychology, with a specialization in statistical methods. 

My poor grade was due to stress from a shitty relationship. I ended that relationship, then went on to take a higher level stats course and got an A+. Then I studied extra hard for the psychology subject GRE and got the maximum score on the statistics portion. I also picked an independent research project that required a complicated statistical method and self-taught. I ended up getting into my PhD program because of my expertise in statistics specifically, lol. 

So, you just gotta prove you're better at it now. Growth is a positive thing!",1
"I was never one to have anxiety as a teenager (I am now 22) and occasionally pass out (reason unknown). This has given me GREAT anxiety. So bad that I feel like I can't breath and will pass out. I take deep breaths (sounds silly, but it works). I also put a cold rag on my neck and tell myself that I am okay.",1
"I had a grapefruit sized tumor when I was 20 that nearly caused sepsis from killing an ovary and internal bleeding. I then found out I have endo. And then PCOS. And another autoimmune disorder. And bipolar 2. I was honestly angry for a while because my brother is a picture of health. I felt cheated out of a “normal” life. But now that I have them all under control, I just have kind of accepted it. I try not to minimize my problems, but I force myself to put it into perspective. Yeah, okay, it’s a little harder for me to lose weight, but at least I have working legs and arms that allow me to be mobile. I journal a fair amount about how all these things affect me internally. I also make jokes that my warranty expired ten years ago. It’s been all downhill from there!",1
"I passed out 2 years ago and it still is something I get anxious about. I have never had broken bones, good health, never been to the hospital for myself till that incident. They couldn’t figure out the reason and said it was most likely a random drop in blood sugar.

Every time I get a panic attack that’s my first thought. I usually just drink a glass of juice for reassurance but it’s still something I ruminate on. The last panic attack, I was hyper focused on what if I have a stroke or what if I go “crazy”.",1
"Passive aggression. It’s the most unproductive shit and pisses me off so much. 

I make a point to confront people who do it just to keep it out of my life. They’re doing it because they fear actual confrontation, so you have to show them that it gets them confrontation anyway for it to stop.",1

"I can not stand when I'm riding my bike and someone else on a bike rides up in front of me at a red light, then they ride slow so I have to pass them. Then they get in front of me at the next red light!!! Like, dude, I'm faster than you!! Stop doing that!!",1
"> but I do get cycle rage 

Omg, I thought I was the only one! 🤣

Edit: I also HATE when someone in a car is being over accommodating. Like when I'm over a block away and the person is stopped at an intersection (the ones without lights/crosswalks) just waiting for me to pass and there are no cars passing by.. so it ends up making me feel like I gotta be the one to hurry up and pass them first.",1
"Especially when they're in the left lane... where I live, the left lane is the passing lane. The least a slow driver can do is just move over to the right. When they won't even do that, I get so aggro!!",1

"I’ve thought that perhaps it was good (?) my dad passed at the “right” time. He died in 2015. Do not get me wrong, I MISS HIM every single day. I loved my dad. I only get these thoughts when I think of things that make me myself that I now (learned from mom) know he would disapprove on. He would never approve my hair (I’ll never go back to long hair), coloring my hair (let alone multiple times), how I am not straight (pansexual, and usually more attracted to women- I’m a woman), or even being able to go out late with friends. I don’t even know if he would’ve liked to find out I got a boyfriend in junior year- he was so protective and joked in ways to where he might have gotten a bad impression on my then boyfriend. Apparently, he was more racist, anti lgbtq+, bad republic, and sexist than I knew- but since he died before I went to high school when I branched out, I never got to discover him like that. I can see myself arguing with him about this stuff, and the ONLY time I thought perhaps it was better he passed at that time? I am so happy how I can be myself now, and I would not change that for the world.. and can’t help but wonder how sad I’d be if he happened to be alive now and probably restricted how I could be myself. It’s the most selfish thought, I think, I’ve ever had. Mom thinks this too, who is none of the things Dad was like, and we never mean to be bad about it, but we can’t help get these thoughts in our heads! Even though we miss him. We also believe that things in life, bad or good, happen for a reason.. so this is something we’ve thought and talked about.",1
"I have been involved in several serious car accidents (never my fault, i have been a passenger in all of them) and I have a fear of dying that way. To the point where I almost have a panic attack if the driver is going too fast.

So every time I’m in a car, every curve it makes, every highway I’m on, I visualize a way that it can go wrong and create major car accidents in my head. 
If I’m driving alone, I constantly think about yeeting onto another car and picture my car going up in the air and flipping over. I can’t help it, it’s always on the back of my mind
I’m not crazy btw, just terrified of car accidents",1
"Someone I knew had just committed suicide (he was my peer at the time, both of us teenagers) and I was in Spirit Halloween with my mom shopping and we passed a Ouija Board, and I had an invasive thought to tell my mom that “we should get that for _his moms name_”. I thankfully did not say that out loud",1
I have so many. I honestly want the people I love to die cos they irritated me that badly. When I see small people I wanna hit them with my car when im driving. It's a passing thought okay. My mind has a form of tourettes too. In a sense. I always think of the worst thing to say but I dont say it,1
"I know many professional musicians, singer/songwriters, etc. and I just didn't have the immense passion or drive for music that they had, and that is required if you're going to build a career in that field. I still love playing music and singing, but the career I eventually chose (writing) is a source of a lot more passion and determination for me.",1
"This sounds mild, no blood, no gore, no emergency hospital trips... I managed to get two consecutive slipped disks by stretching before I got out of bed.

That sounds like nothing, but I spent the next month and a half bedridden, in agony (a genuine 10 on the scale for me). I couldn't sleep, move, sit for more than 10 minutes, I was stiff all the time. I still had to go out, still had chores and jobs to do, but simply struggled with everything.

It's not just that certain movements caused pain. There was a baseline pain there 24/7, if I triggered that extra pain from movement or even just sitting/standing without moving too long I ended up in so much pain I literally passed out. 

If I sat for too long my lower back and legs went numb. My thighs would ache, I got cramps in my legs. My arms hurt from having to use them to lug my body around. I once got stuck to the floor and basically just had to lay on my back sleeping there until it calmed down enough to try and move again.

Then randomly, one morning I woke up and it was all back to normal. 

Back injuries run in the family, my mum and gran had similar problems, my mum actually had some of her spine operated on to try and fix some of her problems.

Edit, for comparison, my second worst injury, which I'd put as a 7 or 8 on the pain scale, was where I degloved my ankle by walking just 1 mile in boots that weren't broken in.",1
"I had been renting a townhouse for years from a private owner. Stuff had been left in the backyard. (Weathered/ broken umbrella, weathered chairs, a rusty 'portable' rod iron fire pit)

I finally got permission to get rid of the stuff. Most of it was easy to break down and dispose of. But that stupid fire pit was heavy AF and hard to move on the uneven tile that was on the patio. 

One summer night, I had a drink or two, was out back smoking just glaring at this ugly thing and finally had enough. I figured if I could get it to the wall, I could find a way to leverage it over the wall. Since I lived in the corner of my street, the dumpsters were close, so I could drag it the rest of the way.  (I didn't want to take it through my house. It was filthy, rusty, super gross)

So I was pushing and pulling this stupid thing, sweating bc even at 8pm it was still like 98*F outside. I was so close to my backyard patio wall when it got stuck in the grout indentation of tile. So I took a deep breath and pushed with all my strength, but my right hand slipped. I fell forward and one of the rusty rod iron bars when straight through my arm, from the base my palm, up past my wrist. 

I did what I medically know you shouldn't do, I pulled my arm up and ripped it away from the bar. 

Went to my bathroom, realized it was bleeding really bad, grabbed a hand towel and tried to apply pressure. The rest is pretty fuzzy, but I know I called 911 (blood on my phone and conversation length noted in my phone history)

I guess I told the operator I would open the front door, bc it was unlocked and open when they found me passed out on my bathroom floor(I never used my front door- garage was attached,  so I had to have gotten up and opened it which is probably what made me pass out). Once I passed out, obviously pressure was no longer being applied, so I was quickly bleeding out. Luckily I lived within a few blocks of the hospital. 

I vaguely remember the paramedics and ER. I remember my OP nurse who was super sweet to me, talking about how much she liked my Alice in Wonderland tattoos(such a random flash of a memory), before I was rolled into emergency surgery. And then I was out until 2 days later. 

I had blood transfusions, apparently my surgery took over 6 hours and a few different drs in there working on me. 

I have permanent damage. The bottom part of my palm is numb 24/7. I have constant pain near the tendon that was repaired. Plus a gross scar. 

So ya. I'm a world class klutz. Just none of my episodes have nearly killed me before. So that's my ultimate story of being a dumbass klutz.",1
"I work Monday-Friday in a customer service job and would consider myself introverted, so I love nothing more than coming home and being alone. 

That being said, I do feel lonely every now and then. I have plenty of friends I see often so it’s more due to being single. I usually just let the feeling pass",1
"To pass the time, I learn something. I read, I audit online MOOCs, I download learning apps that teach other languages, coding, or really anything, I listen to podcasts and join in the conversation.  The learning apps and online courses tend to connect to larger learning communities, so there is human interaction in the discussion boards.

I also do all the other stuff like visit the library, call friends, volunteer, join community clubs.  

In the last few years I have really crossed the line between solitude and lonliness.   I hope I can get back to solitude, but I've found for lonliness there is no way to keep it away, I have just learned to spend my day with it.  So, these activities do not stop the lonliness for me, they just give me something to do while being lonely.",1
"I used to think of it as ""temporarily dating myself."" I'd get ready the same way I would for an exciting date. Put some fun music on, take your time getting ready, dance around in your undies... Give yourself little things to get excited about. Get out there and go for a hike or a walk. Take amazing photos. Play a video game like Skyrim or something that appeals to you... Just try to embrace this period in your life. It's growth. It's change. It's a prerequisite to the rest of your life. A right of passage...a vision quest. 

When you ""date yourself,"" you end up trying new things, living unapologetically, and discovering things you never knew you liked. This is the phase where you think up a ""version"" of you that you think is awesome. (Positive visualization! Imagine what you will be, and do what you must do to get there. It's fun once you get into it.)

Good luck.

Also side note: everyone is lonely right now with this pandemic. Nothing about this is normal. It's 100% okay to acknowledge that and just call a friend and say, ""dude. I'm lonely."" Lean on your friends and family when you need to, and do your best to make your life as fun and healthy as possible during this time.

I hope you find your flow very soon! Good things await.",1

My grandpa just passed three days ago. Not well. Couldn’t visit him all year in his assisted living home. Had a stroke and was gone a few hours later. He was only a couple weeks shy of 97.,1
"My grandma is going to die sometime in the next few weeks.  We can't definitively pin it on COVID, but she tested positive, got pneumonia, ""recovered,"" and now her body is just shutting down (she refuses food and water).

She's been declining physically and mentally for a long time, so it's not unexpected.  I've lost close loved ones before, so none of this is new either.  I'm sure the grief will still hit me hard when she actually passes though.  She was always one of my heroes growing up.",1
"I lost both my grandpas in november. I could not visit them both in the hospital to say a final goodbye because both of them live in other countries. I was hit really hard when my grandpa on my fathers side of the family. It was my first time loosing a family member.  I had to take some time off from my workplace.

A couple weeks later i began to feel a little better. I got a phone call from my mom, she told me that my grandpa on my moms side also passed away. I broke down crying. I felt broken. It was like something broke inside of me. I dont know how to describe it.

I am still grieving but i have resumed my daily routine.",1

"My mother passed away right after I graduated college and got married ( I was 24). My father passed away soon after and it was very... Traumatic. I was 27. As an only child, these were my best friends and it seemed impossible to keep relationships that I had, make new ones, etc.

I went through a lot of mixed emotions, obviously depression, but I became very angry and would lash out at people. I was angry because I felt life wasn't fair and I suddenly had this awakening to how cruel the world was. I had night terrors constantly, I had issues seeing blood, hearing screaming, etc. They sent me into a panic.

I was diagnosed with PTSD and sought therapy. After a year, I'm significantly better than I was. I still yearn for conversations with my parents. They bless me with talks in my dreams but I run a business and it would be nice to show them what I've accomplished. I miss their phone calls. When I'm sick, I miss their cooking and care. There are a lot of small details I miss and yearn for but I find myself trying to make new memories with my husband and friends.

I find that tradition was a large part of my childhood and the memories associated with my parents so I'm trying to create new ones to look forward to. I'm not forgetting my parents, but rather, I've read that chapter and now I'm opening the next.",1
"Kept with the day to day, it's really all you can do. My dad was killed in an accident right after I turned 20 and my mom died suddenly due to a heart attack 3 years ago.

You are never the same. It has honestly impacted every single facet of my life",1
"Right, so I was really close to my mum. Only child of a single parent. Losing her was really hard. After that, in the space of about 3 years I moved jobs twice, relocated across the country twice and got married. I also distanced myself from some relatives who were very bad to my mum, but whom my mum had wanted me to keep in my life whilst she was still alive (complicated). All very interlinked.

Specifically to deal with losing my mum, I went on anti-depressants for about a year and did two spells in therapy. The first was after a year and it was specific grief counselling. I had a great therapist, fantastic rapport and it helped a lot. I couldn’t have done it right away though, it was too raw.   


I also had some therapy soon after the grief counselling, to help me deal with my parent’s divorce, which was long and messy, and my subsequent attitude to dating/relationships. I’d parked a lot of it in adolescence, but losing my mum brought a lot of that stuff back up. The therapist was pretty good, had an ok but not great connection with them. It helped some but it was a bit of a dead end.

My dad died a few years later. Wasn’t close to him- very limited contact since childhood. Messy circumstances with step-family around the time of his passing. Went to grief counselling again very briefly. Most of the things that arose were to do with my parent’s divorce again, so worked through those myself with the help of,a,friend with a similar background. That helped as much as anything is going to help.

It’s been over 10 years now since my mum died. At about the seven year mark I started to remember things with real joy rather than through a lens of pain. I think this took longer for me than it often because I looked after her in the terminal stages of breast cancer and I probably had some form of PTSD from that. But PTSD awareness wasn’t the same 10 years ago as it is now.

It really helped me to do a few things. Firstly, light a candle for her every evening in the run up to Christmas and for a while after. Secondly, to keep buying a gift for her birthday and at Christmas. Something she would have liked.

Finally, making a gift in her memory to the local art gallery. She was an artist and also a teacher (literature rather than art). So the gift was directed towards community art programmes that reach out to kids and vulnerable people. There’s a little plaque on a wall I can go and visit when I miss her. It wasn’t a huge gift or anything, they’re just thoughtful like that.",1
"Mom passed away 10 years ago. I fell to pieces with grief for a bit, and I know she'd hate that. I also got a graduate degree, established a career, bought a house, and a few other things that I think she'd be proud of.",1
"Tried to make my mum proud, honestly. My mum passed away when i was 14 (am now 23) and it was really tough. She had cancer from when I was 7, so most of my memories are of her being sick in some way or another as she went into remission twice but it came back. My dad was heartbroken so while he tried his best, he wasnt really there for me and we quickly developed into a flatmate situation more than parent/child where he would work and do laundry, but i would make dinner and clear up after. 

I was exceptionally lucky in having an amazing partner, who had unfortunately lost his mum not long beforehand. We had started dating a couple of months before my mum passed, and she loved him to bits too which was awesome, and we're still together. If it weren't for him, i'd be in a much worse situation cos i started self harming and that was when my depression/anxiety started to kick in. 

So I focused on my studies in getting into college, then uni and now a full time job in something vaguely related to my degree. It gets easier over time as, like someone else said, you start to be able to look back at the good times and acknowledge the bad for what they were. I kept looking forward and try not to look back too often as its still quite painful. But life goes on and they'd want you to be happy",1

"After my dad and mom passed away within 2 years of each other, almost 11 years ago, I needed space, a lot of it, just to be by myself for a while. 

I still need those, and I have days where I wanted to sleep all day. I made myself get out of bed and get on with my life just to keep up appearances, especially during Thanksgiving and Christmas. 

I had to do the usual day to day routine to survive, to keep myself occupied, just so I wouldn’t feel sad, but it wasn’t that successful. There are days when out of nowhere I would cry my eyes out, and times when I just want to be left alone. 

My grandpa passed away a month and a half ago, and while it was expected, as he was suffering from dementia, it still hurts. I’m managing all I can for now, day by day. Writing has been my therapy, as it has helped me so much. Also, talking to my sister, my aunt, and my cousins has helped things be less painful.  

I’m managing, but I know now that I don’t have to do it alone.",1
"My dad passed away when I was 18. We were never insanely close, but he was a great dad and super fun to be around. His death was very sudden (heart attack), so I guess that was what messed me up the most.

In the hours after his death, I did nothing. I didn't even cry. Then I broke down. Then I got into business mode. Wanted to go get the death certificate, fix everything for everyone who went to the funeral, support my mom and sister, etc.

Then I moved back to where I was living (I was 1000 miles away studying but was visiting when it happened), tried to go back to my normal student life, managed to do it for maybe a week, and stopped attending classes. I started having a lot of issues, pains in random places, shivers, feeling like warm water would run down parts of my body when I wasn't even sweaty. Looked for doctors, got diagnosed with a condition that is basically inflammation of the center of your ribcage (reason why I always had ""heart pain""), treated that, and ultimately ended up seeing a psychiatrist because I had not grieved and my mind was causing at least 90% of my ailments. Antidepressants helped a lot, then I found a job and moved on with my life.

It's been many years, but every time I visit I still expect to see him there, and I still catch myself speaking of him as if he's still alive. It was not easy, and becoming completely functional again took me 2-3 years. 

Tl;dr it was a very sudden death, and it messed me up emotionally and physically, then was able to ""move on"" after a few years. Some days I miss him so much I cry.",1

Same here. I'm 27 and I feel so lucky I still have both my parents but I feel like there's a high chance I'm gonna lose my shit when my mom passes. I'll be equally as devastated about my dad but even thinking of losing my mom makes me wanna cry.,1

I remember when I first heard of her passing it was all very numb. But when it hit me that the next time I travel to visit my family she will actually not be there smiling and cooking for the family as she always loved to do, I cried like a baby in my bfs arms all night. Just typing this now makes me tear up. At least now she’s no longer in pain, pancreatic cancer took her so painfully and quickly.",1

"In the first week of May, when my government finally announced that they would arrange flights to take their citizens home. 
I spent half of March and all of April living in an almost apocalyptic scene- first all my flatmates moved out, just disappeared on me as they caught last minute flights back home. I live in student halls with mostly international students, so everyday I would hear atleast 3 students drag their suitcases away right below my window, and leave for their respective houses.

I felt like the last person alive. I would just sit by myself in my room all day waiting for when I'd get to go home. In retrospect, there was no serious emergency, but the pandemic made me feel like I would never see my family again. 

The day I finally got the news that I could go back home, I literally burst out crying. I have never cried that way before. It's how you see people crying when someone they know passes away. It was half scream and half cry. I swear, if my flatmates were still around and heard it, they would have freaked the fuck out. 

I made it home safely. I've spent 3 months here with my family and it was very healing. Now I'm going back in a couple weeks.",1

I was destroyed for a while after.",1
"The day after we postponed our wedding due to COVID (April date postponed to October and now October cancelled) last week. My father has terminal cancer, wanted to see me and my long term partner get married  before he dies and now will most likely pass away before we are able to be together again. I cried for two days straight.",1

"Oh that is so so hard. My heart goes out to you. My father passed from organ failure related to years of chemo. I remember trying to take care of my mum during that time. Honestly, it has only been 5-7 years after his death that I am able to process it. Hugs to you random internet friend.",1
"My father passed away 8 months ago from cancer as well. Those final days are the hardest, even when you know it's their time. You sound so strong taking care of your family like that. Don't forget to take care of yourself too. You can't pour into others when your cup is empty. 
Sending love your way ❤",1

"I want to hear experiences, please. Someone in the family has an ectopic pregnancy and she got methotrexate 2 weeks ago. Her level went from 4000 to 1000 in the past 1.5 weeks. She has mild abdominal pain which she's told is expected but sharp pain indicates a rupture so I want to know your experiences with a ruptured tube from an ectopic pregnancy. What are your experience from a ruptured tube? like:

&#x200B;

Did you know?

&#x200B;

Did you not know?

&#x200B;

Did you pass out?

&#x200B;

Did you continue doing tings without knowing?

Did you hemorrhage?

&#x200B;

Did you scream in pain?

&#x200B;

Did your pain constantly persist?

"Kidney stones were nothing, but I had doc's permission to go home for three of them and lay into a six pack of beer. 


Alcohol should never, ever be used as medicine, except I managed to pass 3 medium to large stones with a minimal amount of blood and pain without lithotripsy. Had to pee through a strainer in order to capture the stones for the lab, which became progressively harder with each beer, but it worked and I didn't even need antibiotics. 


Birth was murder, I had two 3rd degree tears. 79 stitches. My sweet baby has her father's giant Charlie Brown head.",1
,
Kidney stone stuck for a week then a stent from my kidney to bladder for SIX long ass weeks. Most painful thing I have ever been thru! Went to the ER 4 times before I asked how much longer the stone would take to pass.. 🤦‍♀️ almost exactly a year later had a stone on the other side. Had to have 911 called. I was delirious from the pain and honestly don’t remember much besides BEGGING the paramedic to help me. They had to carry me down two flights of stairs. Was blessed with another stent 🤦‍♀️ Worst pain ever. 20/10 wouldn’t even wish it on my worst enemy,1
My wife passed a kidney stone WHILE being induced unsuccessfully! It was AWFUL! Finally passed the stone and had a C-section. That’s a level of tough I can only imagine!,1
"I have kidney stones pretty often, and I've learned a couple things. Preparation and knowing what to expect is key:

\- See a Urologist every 3-6 months. They can take an X-Ray or a CT Scan and see exactly what's going on, and do lithotripsy, which isn't easy, but way easier and significantly cheaper than having kidney stones and going to the ER.

\- Keep Norco on hand. Norco doesn't make me nauseous, and is very potent. I take Motrin when the pain isn't too bad, but when it gets really bad, Norco literally saves me from having to go to the hospital, where they will try to give me morphine which makes me even more nauseous. Or if I tell them I don't want morphine, they will give me Norco, so very little reason to go to the hospital if I already have what they would give me! (and I know the stone isn't too big to pass, because I get scanned regularly)

\- If nausea is a big problem for you like it is for me, try to get a prescription of Zofran and Phenergan. Also have bread on hand to nibble on because it helps so so much. I prefer Ezekiel.

\- As soon as you start experiencing pain, schedule an appointment with your Urologist!!! This could save you tons of money and time so you won't need to go to the ER. Stones usually take a couple days at least to pass, and it starts off not too bad, and then gets a lot worse.

\- Get the app ""My Water"", and record how much water you drink daily. Drinking enough water is not something you want to slack on because stones can form in a matter of weeks. I have a really really hard time drinking enough water, and without this app I would probably drink half of what I should.

&#x200B;

The first stone I had was the worst, because I had no idea what to do. One of the worst moments of my life... Now it's still bad, but not so bad I have to go to the hospital.",1
"Childbirth can be such a wildly different experience between different women, and different births. Some people have bad menstrual cramp contractions and the baby comes out with barely a graze. Others have days of intense back labour and get torn and cut apart.
The labour for my first was fast and intense but not kidney stone level. However, the things done to my body to get the baby out when she got her shoulders stuck... let’s just say I’ve only passed out from pain once in my life.",1
"I never passed my kidney stones because they were so large, they actually went in thru my back to take them out. They were large enough that the urologist gave me a piece to take home. But suffering trying to pass them, having a stent, and them wreaking havoc on my kidneys for three months was worse than anything I could ever imagine.",1
"To me, the level of pain was about the same, but with labor, at least you get a break in between contractions, and it ends with a sweet little baby. Kidney stones are constant pain that can last much longer with no real breaks in the pain, and of course, no baby at the end, although passing a kidney stone can feel like a huge rock moving through.",1
"The stents are 100% worse than the stone, excruciatingly uncomfortable.",1
"Towards the end I was wondering if I was gonna die though. I remember thinking how is so much pain even possible. They were so strong and so close together I could barely catch my breath and I was so exhausted I felt I was sure to just collapse and die any minute. Never passed a kidney stone but I'm having another baby soon so I couldn't tell you on the former, but the latter is happening again so we all are massochists for some babies.",1
" I'd like to add that the Bechdel test is meant to illustrate how little representation women are given in popular media. It's a condemnation of films as a genre, not meant to be used as a measure of an individual work's representation of women. 


 I think the [Mako Mori test](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Mako_Mori_test) does a better job of judging how women are portrayed in a specific piece.  To pass the test, there needs to be:

a) at least one female character;

b) who gets her own narrative arc; 

c) that is not about supporting a man’s story.",1

Mother passing away so suddenly 10 years ago. She was ill but it wasn't due to the illness.,1
"Finding my grandpa dead. It was the day before my exams were starting. I had just sat to resume studying after my evening tea. A friend of grandfather's came home in a hurry to inform us that he was hurt. He had fainted on his way back home from the temple. Only my other grandparents were home and I had to go with my other grandfather and the friend to the place. 

My grandfather was there lying on the path to enter a restaurant. A group of people around him. He was cold. I knew the second I saw him. I knew he was gone. My mom came by then in another taxi to take him to the hospital. I remember gathering his things from the vegetable vendors there. I just stood there wondering what to do. I was not in my senses. A random passer by told me they'll drop me home. 

I was so confused I couldn't even give directions. It was a 3 minute walk. Single road. I just couldn't speak. I came home and had to manage my grandmothers who were home. I filled them in and I was told to go study. The grandma who's husband died called me from the hospital to study. She told my grandpa will want me to do well in exams. 

I somehow managed. Wrote the exam and remember breaking down after it was over. My friends didn't know what had happened. I had just asked what will happen if I don't write the exam. I cried all the way back home from college. It was a 2.5 hour journey. It was the worst time of my life. 

I couldn't mourn. I couldn't study. I was guilty of not reaching the place earlier. It was the worst period. I had a meltdown the next day when they were performing the religious rituals on thatha. I even went to the crematorium because I wanted to be with him till the end. 

I'm better now. Still can't believe I went through that. I used to not be able to walk past the restaurant for almost a year. I got over that and even recently went to eat there. I just miss my thatha so much. He was such a smart person. Loving and kind.",1

I was getting ready to leave, about an hour later (I was out of town heading back in when I got the call) and I got the call that he had passed away suddenly. I had already prepared for him dying, but had given myself the solace and hope of seeing him alive one last time. The fact that I wasn’t able to say goodbye was rough.",1

And yet look how far men have to go before they start to get uncomfortable. I mean, they're not only comfortable with imagining such a law, they're actually writing, passing, and enforcing THOUSANDS of these laws, all around the world, and most men are completely comfortable chiming in on whether or not they think those laws go far enough in controlling women's bodies.",1
"Back in 2016 a cousin reached out to me on Facebook to tell me my biological dad was in a hospice and was given around 3 weeks to live. I hadn't seen him since I was 8 and thought I didn't care but it hit me like a tonne of bricks. I had so many unanswered questions that I had pushed to the back of my mind for over a decade, and I also realised there was half of me that I knew nothing about. 

I arranged to go and see him 2 days after my cousin got in contact but found out on the day that he had passed away. If I could go back to my past self I'd advise her to get in contact years earlier, not necessarily for a relationship but for some closure.",1

"I took one day at a time and chose to pray for and wish the best for them. My paternal grandfather was diagnosed with leukodysplasia about two years before he died in late December 2013. I was surprised at how quickly he passed the day he was supposed to have his first surgery/chemo (?), as he passed very quickly after receiving morphine for pain. He was also emotionally abusive when I was a kid. As such, I felt surprise when my dad called my sister to let us know our grandfather passed on  and relief that he couldn't hurt us anymore even though we'd been estranged from him for almost ten years then. That came with a touch of sadness and concern for my living paternal family, but also remembered I could not control how they handled his illness and passing, just my response to any ill-treatment, etc. I might receive.   


Taking one day at a time and not letting estranged family members, including my grandfather, use his illness to hurt me did wonders, in sum!",1
"I'll tell you what my best friend did. Her father has been absent from her life for the most part of her life and when he was involved, it wasn't a good experience. In her late 20s, he got diagnosed with cancer with 2 years estimated time to live. She did think about what to do and decided to not let him back into her life. She felt nothing changed about their relationship because he was ill. Like that wasn't about their relationship. She felt sorry for what he did to himself, she got upset again about her childhood but it was a short-lived depression.

She still contributed to his treatment financially and when he died about 5-6 years later went to his funeral. That's all. One of her older sisters did the same. Her other older sister was far more involved. She was the one who went to the hospital and stayed with him, found people to take care of him, etc It was partially because out of the three sisters she was the only one who didn't work and had more flexible hours. It still caused a problem between the sisters but the other two told her she could choose to not do more but shouldn't expect them to support her when that meant being involved with their father. I think it's fair.

He passed over a year ago. None of the daughters regret their decision.",1
"I'm estranged from my entire family due to leaving my religion. Eventually one by one all of them will get sick and die. I will find out by a brief message, or short information only phone call.

"Going to sound a bit weird but a close friend who I cared for through terminal cancer passed away. Her family were useless and selfish, through out the time she was ill. After she passed and was in the funeral home her grown up son and wife went to see her and took mementos to place in her coffin. They described to me what they’d taken, there was limited restrictions as she was being buried. You would not believe the list, it was long and a lot of the stuff held little significants it genuinely felt like they were using it as an opportunity to have a clear out. I told a friend about it and then started laughing. The vision of the pall* bearers (not sure of spelling) struggle to lift her coffin and it rattling through the church was too much on top of the raw emotions and I laughed so hard I cried.",1

"Going through alternative school.

It was fucking horrible, every day, I had to get a fucking pat down and walk through a metal detector going in. It was humiliating, dehumanizing, and worst of all, it triggered my fucking dysphoria to the Nth degree. It wasn’t uncommon for me to break down in tears after :(. On top of that, I had a personal escort that had to take me to and from every class, and if I dared defy them, I’d go to juvenile detention center. I had to wear the uniform, which was just shorts and a polo short, which framed me so much as a boy, that I literally just gave up eventually and lied through my teeth that I was a boy, just so they would leave me the fuck alone. Oh, and the students, they were utter assholes, constantly making fun of everybody, being assholes, and outright ignoring literally everyone outside of their small ingroups: in a school of less than 300 students. The bus rides were pretty bad too, literally 40 minutes of silence both ways, and I couldn’t have even brought my phone, and I knew no one.

I was hospitalized TWICE in a crisis center, for one week each time, because of how bad it was. That’s just something I should say before I continue.

To make things worse, we weren’t allowed to have phones, or bags at the school. Which meant no opportunity to even distract myself. No bringing a skirt to school and changing into it secretly, no pulling out my phone during passing periods to remind myself that I was indeed living in the real world, not even a notebook for sketching. The only support network I actually had was the counselor (they wouldn’t let me speak to my family over a school phone), and I cried to her countless times about my dysphoria, the students being awful, and everything else.

The schoolwork wasn’t much better either. I literally learned nothing in there, the most we ever got was one worksheet, no textbooks, no resources, no presentations. The only class I ever learned anything in was math, and it was a continuation of geometry, which was decidedly my worst math subject, and kinda still is. Not to mention that they shipped over work from my main campus, but couldn’t ship any resources, or even give me recorded lectures. I was clueless on how to do Latin, to the point where I literally had no option but to use google translate: so I wasn’t even having fun learning a new language.

There was only a few saving graces:

1. I was able to at least wear panties to school, they didn’t police underwear. I was able to wear makeup too, but it didn’t change much, as I didn’t know contouring, or even how to do eyeliner back then.

2. The computers at school had YouTube unlocked, but only a weird selection of videos. There were only a handful of music videos available, and even less gameplay videos. I was able to watch like 5 osu! videos, which was a nice distraction (they were relatively recent too). But as for music, well, just about the only songs I could play from there was the nightcore remix of *Take A Hint* and *Burnt Rice*: take a guess how burned into my head the songs were… still better than silence though. (reality is lemons and the internet’s my lemonade).

3. I was somehow able to watch all of *Rick and Morty* season 1, and the first three episodes of *Gravity Falls*while in ISS. Yep, after I finished my main classes (they didn’t even send over all the work, so this wasn’t hard), I would just ask for a computer, and more often than not, I would get it. I’d sometimes get books, but I wouldn’t care. The ISS monitor definitely hated her job and wasn’t a control freak. There was literally one time where near the end of the class, I put on a video of Cookiezi playing *Revolutionary Etude* - Without headphones -, at near max volume (to be fair, it wasn’t **that** loud), and she gave zero shits as this random guy started watching too (he moved closer to me to see).

You wanna know the real kicker of this story? I was only supposed to be in there for 15 days. Literally just 15 days. I couldn’t even do that, because it was so fucking awful, and mentally damaging.

-

You might be asking, How I’ve dealt with it? Well, I’ve Repressed the shit out of the memories, that’s for sure. I’ve mostly just either gotten kinda drunk, stress eaten my hair, gone for a smoke, or just cried it all out until they go away. When something was really bad, it never truly leaves, but I certainly try my best to cope. Lately I’m hoping that I can go back to school to undo my bad high school years, and maybe get a good memory or two out of it. I can only pray…

This is one of the few things in my life that makes me cry just thinking about it. Not to mention psyche doctors were drugging me through the tail end of this shit, and started prescribing way more drugs after I had to leave the alternative school as well (I left in late October, not sure exactly how many days even passed, or what I was there).

The memories may be fuzzy at points, but they still hurt…",1

"To me, it's not a landmark set in stone, but it does seem like, in their mid-20s, people should be midway between their teens and young adult years, and the point where they at least begin to consider getting their shit together. Knowing themselves as people, building a life that they like, starting to question the baggage they were brought up with and starting to work towards overcoming it if need be, finding at least some passions and abilities that might point them in the direction of a career. Of course, all of these things should be life-long pursuits, and it's never too late for most of them, and of course the age of 25 is completely arbitrary and should never be seen as a ""best before"" expiration date. But it does kinda feel to me like it's around this point in someone's life that they should get their shit together and start becoming the person they want to be.

Which is, on the other hand, why (again, to me personally) it seems too young for marriage and kids, house and car (in cases where it's not necessary). But to each their own, of course.

Edit: the nice thing you'll notice is, the older you get, the less you give a shit about what others think about what your life should look like. I'm 34 now, and I'm the happiest I've ever been, best skin ever, the same weight I had at 18 but much better self-care and beauty knowledge, the most amazing sex life, no kids (people are finally believing me I don't want any), and a complete and utter lack of shits given as far as to what others think my life should look like.",1
"> .idk it seems arbitrary? I mean, is 25 generally considered “older”?

I don't take it literally and focus on what they're actually trying to say without the specific number 25.

Usually when I see it mentioned, they're referring to someone (for example) on /r/relationships who is 19 and engaged to be married and both living at home with parents.

I have no room to talk being that I met my SO when I was 21 and we've now been together 8.5 years.. BUT generally speaking, the person you're with at a young age has a higher likelihood of not being the person you're with long term. So people like to say to wait until at least 25 to get married -- not so much because it definitely *won't* work at a younger age, but because it lessens your chances if you wait.

> “too old” for a lot of things (like dressing a certain way, or feeling unsure in life, which someone who is only a couple of years younger gets a free pass for). I’ve even seen people here say that once you’re 25, you’re not “young” anymore (this is also implied when I see posts targeted towards “older women”, 25 is always the cutoff age)

Kinda same as above - I think it is more a general ""range"" than a hard set thing.

25 is still young enough to get away with a lot clothing wise - almost anything. But I do personally abide by the sentiment that certain clothing more difficult to get away with as we age. You can certainly wear a Tweety Bird tiedye shirt to a job interview if you so choose, but you are putting yourself at a disadvantage by doing so. Same for anything sexy/revealing.. or a full goth getup. Basically - you do you, but we live in a society. You will be perceived accordingly.

Same goes for direction in life. As someone who is still friends with a LOT of people in their 30s that are bartenders and will likely be bartenders as long as they can, I certainly don't think there's anything wrong with not having shit ""figured out"".

But as you start to get up in your later 20s, you are generally expected to be able to take care of yourself and pull your weight in (for example) a romantic relationship. Or even a friendship. Relationships of any kind require both parties to provide partnership to a certain extent. When we are young, not so much the case. But I mean yeah if you can't pay for your half of dinner when you are out with friends, they will likely see something wrong with that.

The friends I mention above have literally not even $100 saved in a bank account, have no health insurance, etc. They aren't ""in the wrong"", but there's no denying they'd be royally screwed if something happened to them. And as they get older, the chances of that happening will continue to increase.",1

"When my dad was dying from lung cancer we sat down and made a bucket list, we assumed we had about a year before he passed and we wanted to knock off as much as possible. He unfortunately had a terrible reaction to the chemotherapy and he was too sick to do much of anything within 2 weeks of treatment and passed away about 3 months after the diagnosis.

I was so angry that instead of 12 months we only got 3 and we didn’t get to do anything on that list.

Be prepared to not be able to do the fun things anymore. Sometimes it can be too difficult for them to even get out of bed much less go on a walk, so if there’s something she loves try to bring it to her. 

Spend as much time as you can, you never know when the meds or cancer starts to eat away at her mental abilities. Watching my dad go from the smartest person in any room to repeatedly asking the same question over and over again was heart breaking.

I’m glad I got to be there for his last months. And as hard as it was watching him die I don’t remember him as the shell of himself he was when he was in a coma for the last couple days of his life. I have many good memories and honestly I think it made him happy talking about the good times we had as a family.

Nothing is going to prepare you for everything that could happen, but just roll with the punches and be present. 

Make sure all her legal stuff is in order too- wills, memberships that need to be canceled, etc. it’s been 9 years and we’re dealing with having to get a death certificate to sell a car that was on my dad’s name when he passed. 

There’s going to be puke, blood, soiled bedsheets, confusion and a lot of tears.

Find a good therapist, I waited until about 5 years after he passed to start seeing one. I wish I would have much earlier.

Best of luck. I hope ask her wishes are fulfilled.

If you have any questions or just want an ear to bend/ commiserate with feel free to PM me. It’s a shitty journey but I’m glad you said you have a good support system, that’s with its weight in gold.",1
"My mother passed October 2016 from endometrial cancer.  Just remember to take care of you and see a therapist.  My mother's passing sent me into such a depression because the worst that could happen, did.  I'm the oldest child and my Dad was beside himself.  So just remember that it's ok to cry-dont try to be 'strong' by not crying and cramming it down.

1. Make sure to have all the plans in place for funeral, so you don't have to make any decisions later.  
2. Be sure that there is enough space in her bedroom for the hospital bed when hospice comes.
3. It's gonna suck hard.
4. Find where her sentimental/expensive jewelry is.  I remember Dad and my sister couldn't find her heirlooms for us to inherit.  Then, when they were cleaning out the closet, it was in a plain box at the bottom of the closet, and not in her jewelry box 
5. Are there people who want to say a few words to her before she passes?  Be sure to also say your goodbyes.  I did it when Mom went into a coma, a few days before she died.
6. Be prepared when she does go into the coma (if she does, her jaw muscles will go slack and it bothered me more than it should have).
7. I administered her morphine when she was home, and I kept a log of how much and what time i administered it. 8. I do remember a friend was retired policeman and he had to do something special with the remaining morphine.

I can't really think of anything else, but please feel free to ask questions.  I hope this helps some.

"My mom died of cancer in August 2016 and not a day pass of me without thinking of her.

"My mom passed away from cancer 5 years ago this April and my only wish is that I took more videos and photos of her.

I was living with her at the time and did everything with her but i still wish I had something tangible to look at :( memories are there but they aren't really enough sometimes.

One thing I did for my mom was contacting her old friends. They came to visit her and that made her very happy. 

This might sound weird but ask her to write you a memory note, and save it. Last May I accidentally found a note my mom left me ( I knew she wrote toward the end because of the bad hand writting) That note made me start living again and got me out of a very bad relationship I was in. It's like she was there for me at a time I really really needed my mother with me.

Also take some time off if you can afford it and just be with her. Get to know some of her routines,  it will help you later on to do the things she did. I bake and cook a lot because that's what I got from her and it makes me happy to do what she used to do. It makes me feel like I still have something of hers.

My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family...",1

"Ask her questions. Many, many questions about her life. Hold her hand as she answers and embrace her when talking about tough times. Feel her heartbeat and feel her face. Use your fingers to memorize curve of her nose, the touch of her cheeks and the smooth sensation of her eyelids. It will not be creepy, trust me.

Hold her hands, smell her scent and be happy that she's still here. Bask in her presence, and remember that feeling. Let her know that you love her, that you've always loved her and shower her with adoration, as when she passes, she knows that her baby loves her. 

Acknowledge everything that you can remember, and don't bring up any regrets. Love her as much as you can, as much as you can muster. Spend as much time as you can with her. Remind her of the happy moments in life.",1
"My dad died of cancer over the summer. A few things beyond what others have mentioned: my dad got very frail and weak, and it was difficult to see him declining in that way. His breath smelled absolutely horrific and it was really hard to physically be near him (of course I sucked it up because I knew time was limited and it was, at least I think, the cancer that made him stinky. Not much to do about that). Be prepared to process what you’re seeing in addition to what is going to happen. 

After he passed, those first few days were an absolute mist of things to do, shit to process, and FEELINGS. I was personally in no condition to make decisions, so I might recommend having someone in your support network help you. For example, while I took that first week off of work, I kept responding to emails and even accepted a project that needed to be completed that week. Looking back I could have used someone to gently close my laptop for me. 

One last thing to think about is your mom’s final wishes. My dad had a will, but it was shockingly light on details about what he wanted after he died. My mom and I thought it was all laid out, but it really wasn’t. The night he passed (he was at home), people were asking questions like “what mortuary do you want us to call?” And we were like.... uh no clue. Should we check yelp for recommendations? The hospice nurse did help us figure that out, but again- we were in that mist of grief/confusion. Having a clearer plan would have been helpful in those first moments. 

Feel free to dm me any time. It’s a lot and a horrible burden to bear, even with a good support network.",1
"My stepmom’s fight lasted five long, beautiful, and horrific years. When I suspected something went wrong, her daughter knew immediately, what started out as breast cancer that had already spread to bones and her kidneys, was now in her brain. 

She passed 11 days after the diagnosis. I think for yourself, the best that you can do is to have a quiet moment with her if possible. Say the things you always wanted to. 

I never got to properly say goodbye, she was already in a coma by the time I got to see her in hospital. I didn’t have the proper supports, and I myself have an illness. It just triggered flares for me. I was so busy trying to make sure my father was eating and sleeping. 

Be prepared because family will fall out. My stepsister only had her grandma here in the country after her mom passed and my father was too much of a wreck to try and keep up with her, or even try and heal together because they’d both been caring for her so long. He lost touch with her and after a year of pushing, my sister and I finally got to reconnect with her. It’s such a sore subject now that he and I don’t speak. Be prepared because my stepmom was definitely the glue that held our family together. She was the absolute love of his life, a joy to have around, she’d light up every room and make you feel part of the family. 

Try to get the legal stuff done as soon as possible so you can cherish the last moments you have. And make sure there are as many moments as possible. Prepare yourself for seeing her in a vulnerable way, because parents don’t always like to be seen as such. There is also something truly heartbreaking about having a nurse flush fluids out of their lungs knowing it’s just going to fill up again while you’re waiting for them to leave you.",1

"One thing I did when my dad had liver cancer  was do what he wanted, in terms of food, desitions , etc ,if he wanted to have pizza for dinner we did it instead of pushing a healthy diet on him.. things I wish I did , have him tell me stories about his life which were super interesting, I do know a few but I can't remember them all and I wish I had him to tell me one more time, also ask him what should I do in different cases so when he was no longer there I would have an answer from him so I'd have at least an idea of what to do instead of feeling hopelessly lost like where to take the car for service what to do when it's too old etc simple stuff that I had problem resolving and felt like trapped inside a hole .. also ask him about important papers like when my dad passed we didn't know where the ownership papers of the house were etc",1
"My grandmother was much closer to me than my mom, and she died of pancreatic cancer when I was twelve. 

-She may deteriorate fast. Much faster than the doctors predict.

-Hearing is the last sense to go.

-Don't feel bad if her passing gives you a feeling you weren't expecting. I felt relief when my grandma died because for the six weeks leading up to her death, the house was pure chaos.

-There's no point in beating yourself up from regret. Try not to think, ""I could've done/said this!"" 

-It's far better to pass in a home than in a hospital. 

-Grief is weird. I didn't experience grief until a few years until my grandma died.",1

"Dealing with the situation right now (Mom undergoing chemo; and dad miraculously emerged from 4th cancer last year) so while I ain’t a women, I guess I am eligible to respond.
1st thing 1st, SHE IS NOT DYING COZ YOU ARE NOT GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN. She is just ailing and you and your family shall emerge victorious. Relax, clear your head and pull-up your Socks. 
Disbelief> Regret> Fear> Denial> Hope; I think these are the 5 stages of emotional journey for a cancer patient plus the pain, side effects of therapy, weight loss, appetite loss, etc. 
1. So the first thing is to be aware and alert towards what your mom is going through and accordingly respond with palliative care. This includes emotional and physical care.
2. Cancer is malignant, it spreads and in advanced stages can cause organ failures or sudden complications. Have an emergency plan of action ready. Ask your doctor what are emergency possibilities and be ready what will you do in case.
3. It’s an expensive disease, be ready with back-up finances 
4. Most important: you cannot have another patient to attend to right now. So everyone else in the family must take better than usual care of themselves
5. If you can, employ atleast a 12-hr paramedic at home. Depending upon type and stage, Cancer patients face delirium, need help with moving, washing and cleaning, etc. It is quite a toll on the primary caregiver. Have someone to share the load at night so the primary caregiver stays well. Shall also help your mom maintain her hygiene, make-up (y she looked beautiful all her life, y not now?), etc
6. Help her attend to her unfinished work, last wishes, etc
7. Spend sometime with her each day and talk to her the good times she had in her life. So when the soul passes away, it remembers this life fondly. Smile often. 
8. Meditate. You are old enough. You have all the answers. Close your eyes and clear your mind. You can do this. You can help her fight it out or move to next level with peace. 
All the best. May God we with you all",1

"My grandmother died from bone cancer years ago. I was very fond of her and I consider her as my second mom. Since she was living with us when we were young, I got to spend a lot of time with her. I always tease her when she eats because when she chews her food, it's as if she has no teeth at all. 

One of my fondest memories of her was during my birthday celebrations with her. She always cooks me spaghetti, chicken lollipops and my favorite dessert, leche flan.

That's why it broke my heart when she passed away days away from my birthday.

I just wished that I had more time to tell her how she means to me. I wish I've spent more time with her. I also wish I got to take more pictures with her but, unfortunately, during that time we didn't have our smartphones yet.

I still regret not being there when she took her last breath. But I do hope she still watches over me.

I miss you so much. How I wish you're still here by my side especially now that I'm very much struggling with life. I will always love you. And see you there soon!",1

"Collect her writing. After I lost my mom at 24 I found that her handwriting was such an intimate way to connect to her as this was the early 2000’s before people videoed a lot on phones and cameras. Any of her recipes that you loved, favourite perfumes (I used to spray it on her favourite sweaters when I missed her after she passed). Please hold her hand and stroke her face even though she looks fragile. I remember mom crying one day because she felt like no one wanted to touch her but it was because she was in so much pain and I didn’t want to cause her more by holding her or touching her. Know that you will be exhausted, that you can’t be there every second for her. Your heart is breaking, you’re under extreme stress and you’re grieving. Learn to forgive yourself for the moments you felt like you should’ve been there but weren’t. And most of all, let her know it’s ok to go when she’s ready. So often we put this pressure on people to stay because we need them and love them. But letting them know that it’s ok, that you understand they can’t fight any longer and that they aren’t giving up just moving on can be a HUGE sense of peace for everyone. 
Death is not the about the person who dies but about those who are left behind to grieve. 
My thoughts and heart go out to you in this terrible time. May you both feel gratitude and love in the final chapters.",1
"My dad passed 8 years ago unexpectedly after a super short battle with cancer and I am upset with myself every day for not asking him more about the bands he was in in highschool and the dreams he had growing up. I wish he had told me more stories... his laugh and voice had faded in my memory. I only have 2 short videos from when he was here and I regret everyday that I didn’t take more. I regret that he always took the photos and was rarely in them... just enjoy the time you have with her and ask her questions.

"I’m not a woman but seeing this post made me think about old times and memories with my mom who died of cancer when I was 18.




We were never really a close family, we didn’t have “real” conversations with each other but we had “cold” love. I really loved my mom so much more than my father. 


When my mom got sick I had to constantly clean our apartment because my father was working and basically had very low need of hygiene around our home. I also had to learn to cook myself food and do shopping and budget the money we had, my mom used to do this. It was a bit too much for a 18 yo at first but I managed pretty well. We knew it was terminal but she didn’t know. She was hoping and praying every day so she gets healthy again. Unfortunately at the time I was very closed emotionally therefore eventually taking care of shit started to feel like chores and got me annoyed. I did them regardless but it was a topic for many fights with my father and I knew those fights were not a good effect on my mom’s health.


Later on she got into hospice. They said she has around a week or so. She held on for so long, she was there for a month in the end. The hospice was in another city so it was quite hard but we managed to visit her every day. She always asked when is she coming home and it broke my fucking heart. She was so high on morphines and she was in ton of pain. I told her “soon”. I lied to her on her death bed. So, don’t lie to your dying mother even if it is for comfort. It haunts me to this day and I’m 26 now. In her last few days she was so high on morphine we couldn’t even talk with her we just sit there and took care of her, etc. One day I thought to myself “fuck this that really isn’t my mom there anymore it’s just her body her soul is gone”. I didn’t go that day. She passed away that night. Sometimes I think to myself she felt like she was a burden to me and she just let herself go so she doesn’t bother me anymore. I wish I could go back in time and spend the last few days with her. I also don’t have any photos of her but I still remember her face and laugh and that’s something I’m gonna hold on for forever.


I shouldn’t have wrote this at work I’m about to fucking cry",1
"My mom passed away from breast cancer when I was 16. We knew it was coming, but none of us had ever dealt with something like this, and now we have a lot of regrets. 

If she's able, have her write you a letter. Going through old birthday cards and old text messages still mean a lot, but I don't have much written that has any substance. It would have been nice if we had thought to have her write letters for future events with advice, but now we have to rely solely on memory. 

My grandparents had her house cleared out and on the market within a week after she was gone. They didn't give any of us much time to go through her things before they donated it all. Everyone grieves differently and I'm not mad at them, but there are a few things that I wish we had held onto. If you're not sure, but it's too painful to look at, put things in storage until you're ready. Even now, 7 years later, I'll be getting ready to go somewhere and wish I had one of her jackets or scarves that I could wear. 

Have her draft a will ASAP. Death can bring out the worst in people and the last thing you will want to do is fight with relatives over money / material possessions.  No one thinks that their family is capable of that, but I've seen it happen time and time again. 

If she's still healthy, I would recommend taking as many photos of you two together and try going on a short trip. Once my mom got too sick, we stopped taking photos because she refused to be remembered like that. I wish I had snapped a few more before it got to that point. 

I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot, but my inbox is open if you want to talk. Praying for you, friend.",1

"My mother passed away from brain cancer 3 years ago. Reading these comments, I feel like my story needs to be said because it's different from most here.

She was a flawed person and my mom and I never had a really good relationship. That doesn't mean that I didn't love her, I just couldn't get along with her. Taking care of someone you don't get along with was really tough- so be kind to yourself and give yourself time too as a caretaker.

I asked her to do many of the things people suggested here but she said no to all of them. She couldn't write because the cancer made her disabled in the right side of her body (she was right handed). She didn't want to be video recorded because she looked ""ugly and fat."" She didn't want to draw or do anything. She just wanted to cry and watch violent crime dramas. I sat and watched more crime dramas in a lifetime in those 2.5 years. But I'd like to think it gave her some happiness just sitting there with her.

Sometimes, it felt very lonely and isolating. Like this was all happening on an island and my friends and support system were too far from it...I was too far from them and they forgot about me. They didn't call to ask how I was doing, some pretended my mom didn't have cancer, others acted like I too had cancer and stayed away the same. When I asked my best friend why she never asked if I was ok she said she wasn't sure it was appropriate to ask knowing I had so much going on. Tell people to ask you what you want. Tell them to show up, tell them to not assume you don't or do want to talk about it. People don't know how to deal with grief, it's not their fault, but ask for the support you need. And you will need it.

People will disappoint you, a lot. Your family, your mom's spouse, your friends. But there will also be people who show up in ways you never expected. Hold onto those people and cherish them. Going through this really helps you to understand those who can show up in tough situations. My husband was my rock and continues to be. He showed up in ways I never expected but it really solidified that even if I was a failure in life, at least I married the right person.",1

"The things that have been a blessing to me from my time with Mama before she passed... 

I had time to really get to know her as a person.  We would talk to the wee hours of the morning and she told me story after story from her life.


I recorded videos of her singing our favorite nursery rhymes that I watch all the time. They are very comforting.. especially if I am sick or had a bad day.


Pictures.  Lots of pictures.  Even ones that you don't think you would like to have later.  Things look different once everything is done.

She taught me to cook her signature dishes her way over an intercom.  I am now often called on by my siblings to make 'Mama's Pot Roast'.

Some of my most pleasant memories of her final months (besides talking) were clipping coupons together on Sundays, using a video chat to 'take' her outside to check on her flower beds and look around, and watching her favorite shows with her.

Be prepared for some bad times, too.  There were a couple of times I had to step away because Mama became so mean and resentful to me (very out of character).  She also didn't like me to leave her side and it would get claustrophobic sometimes.  There was also a brief period where she didn't know who I was and would scream and throw things at me... fortunately she came back to normal.

Smell her.  Feel her skin.  Hug her and really be present.",1
"My dad died of cancer when I was younger... I think it's most important to tell her everything you need to. My biggest regret with my dad was that i was so young, (13), I didn't think he would actually pass away even when he was in hospice, so I always assumed we had more time when we didn't. I wonder if my dad knew how much I loved him, because I was too scared and in denial to say it.",1
"My Mom passed away due to metastatic breast cancer when I was 9 and my brother was 7.. my Mom was 28.. she knew she was terminally Ill for about 3 months before she passed.. my brother and I were never told until that awful day came.. my Dad tried to encourage her to write letters for us to read as we got older, but unfortunately she couldn't accept that she was dying and never did it.. I wish with all my heart that she could have brought herself to do it, but I understand that she was not able to.. my heart breaks when I think about how she must have been feeling, both physically and mentally, during that time.. I do remember her voice saying certain things, and I remember her cackle laugh haha! She was an only child to my widowed grandmother.. years later when my grandmother was dying (also of metastatic breast cancer), I sat with her in the hospital for the most part of her last 3 days.. the things I learned about her in that time was far and beyond any stories I had ever heard before.. with no medication of any kind, she basically relived her life verbally to me, but seemingly unaware that all the events were already lived.. I went on to have 6 kids of own, and I have spent their lives telling them stories, sharing my likes, dislikes, childhood experiences and feelings.. it was important to  me that they knew many of the things I knew about my Mom and how those things stayed with me my whole life.. also, I ask them all the time these same sorts of things about themselves.. I usually know everyone's current favourite things, like colour, food, things to do.. I put a large emphasis on sharing these seemingly mundane details about each other.. in the end, none of it is mundane.. it's all part of what makes us special to our loved ones.. I just wish I had written more things down.. and I really wish I had some recordings",1
"Write things down.
You’ll think you’ll remember things about the time you’ve had together, but you won’t & it will be blurred with grief.

Tell her what you think, feel. Ask her what you want to know. Treat her as normally as you can - if you usually go to your mom for help, keep doing so. She isn’t dead yet. I know it sometimes feel you have to prepare yourself for life without her & that can feel as though you are protecting yourself and her too, but you’ll hold regrets you didn’t enjoy being able to complain about your day or ask her for help while she was still here and after she was diagnosed.

Talk. Talk. Talk. Talk about your fears, about hers. Talk about what her dying plans are and what she wants. Talk about her funeral or what service she would like. Get documents in order. Organising all of this shit when you’re lost in grief in the early days after loss is fucking horrible and having things organised as much as you can before hand helps smooth the process.

Ask her to write to you. Don’t open it until after she’s gone. It will be devastating and comforting all rolled into one when you get to read it, but you’ll treasure it. 

Understand that people will say shitty things. Or they won’t say anything because they won’t know what to say, so they avoid you instead. Be prepared and surround yourself with people who love you.

Get help - palliative help, cancer nurses/charities. There is usually help available - accept it. 

Ask her stupid questions you’ll think you’ll never want the answer to. What was she scared of growing up? Who was her first love? How did she feel about her parents when she was young? How did she feel when she got pregnant with you? Did she breast feed? Silly stuff. You’ll want the answers one day. And even if you don’t get all the answers, bonding and sharing can’t be a bad thing.

Be there with her as often as you can, but try to keep hold of some semblance of normal life. Have a bath, get a shower every day, have a walk. Little stuff like that; but don’t put pressure on yourself. 

If she’s well enough tick off aspects of her bucket list. My mother’s was to dye her hair purple and then shave her had. She wanted a tattoo too but couldn’t get it due to chemo (& at that point she was treatable, until she wasn’t and it was too late). 

Take photos. Even if she feels and looks like shit, even if you do. Take them. 

Be prepared that death isn’t like you see in the movies. People die differently. Get some support.

My mother died 4 years ago from lymphoma when she was 52 and I was 23. My dad died aged 60 when I was 24. My mum was a Palliative Nurse and the greatest lesson she left me with was how to prepare to die and how to die & what I should do afterwards. 

The biggest regret I have is that I don’t have a picture of her hands. I think about her hands and how soft they were and how when I was unwell she would stroke my head and place her cool hand on my forehead. When I saw her in the chapel of rest I couldn’t see her hands and it haunts me that I don’t remember them in detail.",1
"My mom passed of cancer March 30th, 2019.   All three of us, her sons, were staying with her in her final weeks, and she died at home.  I'm very glad she could go that way, with her sons around her, at home. She was in very good shape until a few weeks before the end.   The last few weeks she was very fuzzy, on pain meds, and in pain from swelling in her feet, often unable to sleep unless really doped up on pain meds.   We did have ""hospice care"" which amounted to a visit once a day by some workers who helped her shower and etc.  She had some kind of insurance policy that should have paid for more help but they weaseled out of it.  (Check on anything like that, especially get a copy of the contract, then talk to your lawyer or accountant and see what it provides.)

I don't regret that we did it this way, but.... when my time comes I want to be put in a facility where the family can visit but there will be qualified personnel to take care of me, so there's less stress on family.   This might be something to discuss with her beforehand, and if she wants to go that route then start looking into it as soon as possible.

Other thoughts.  Record her voice/video and her stories about the family history.   Likewise, if there are family heirlooms lying around it's a good idea to get her on video explaining their history.  If there is anything that might be contentious about the inheritance, get it sorted out and might as well get that on video too, maybe visit an accountant with her  to discuss things.  (My father and my aunt on that side had a major disagreement when their mother died and as a result I grew up not knowing my aunt.  My mother's biggest worry is that something like that would happen between her kids.)   If she uses a computer or anything like that, get her passwords to her computer, email, etc.  Learn about her bills, in fact it'd probably be a good idea to start managing them for her.  Learn about her life insurance, annuities, etc, if she has any, you'll need to contact them after she passes and deal with them.  (Another good reason to get an accountant.)   

Think ahead about what to do about clearing out her house, especially where to put any heirloom furniture.  My mom cleaned out a bunch of stuff prior to her passing, but that was the kind of person she was, it might not be something your mom can deal with.  In the weeks after she was gone, my brothers and I did a pretty good job, under the circumstances, of cleaning out a bunch of her stuff (clothing, books) , but all of the furniture is still sitting there because we haven't gotten it together enough to move it out and into storage or something.  I think we're avoiding it.  It's not pleasant being at her house.",1
"My grandma died about three years ago. She died sooner than expected after being diagnosed with liver cancer. She had her body donated, so there was no funeral or viewing to pay my respects and say my final goodbyes. I felt bad about it for so long until I realized she wouldn’t want me to be sad about it. 


After I was done grieving, I went out of my way to find every picture I had of her. Read every birthday card (or cards in general). I preserved every email, text message, and other forms of contact I had with her. I regrettably don’t have any videos or recordings of her. 


It was from this experience that I decided to do the same with my mom (whom is still alive). When she’s leaves a voicemail, I now save them and store them in multiple locations in case anything fails. I have a photo album dedicated to her whenever I’m able to snap a picture of her. I’ve started writing down recipes she has. I try to spend as much time with her as I can. Save all the cards and letters. I even have a playlist of artists and bands that she likes. Just little stuff that you don’t realize is that important until its gone. 


I’m currently in my mid-twenties and my mom is 52, and I think she’ll be around for a while, but it never hurts to prepare for the inevitable. My grandma passed when she was 68. I never thought she would leave so soon, but she did. I won’t tell you it’s easy or hard, or what to do, how to feel... because everyone prepares and grieve in their own way. I just hope you’re able to find a way to be with her and remember her in the best way you can.",1
"Yes, this.  My mom passed away from breast cancer when I was fifteen, back in the early 2000's and before smartphones meant you had every opportunity to record something.  We only have one snippet of a clip where she's talking to me at my fifteenth birthday.  That's the ONLY recording we have of her voice because my stepdad threw all the old home videos (taken before he was in the picture) out when she died.

I have scoured our basement, every box, every nook, and cranny trying to here more than her saying, ""Hey, Rivlet, do your friends...should you guys go..."" before the video cuts out.

It's been fifteen years and while I can sort of remember her voice, I miss her still and wish I had more.  Pictures, voice recordings, memories.  It'd also be nice to have something to show my kids because, to be honest, words will never do her justice.",1

People will say the most wretched things about black people, absolutely unprompted, when they think they are talking to literally anyone but a black person.  

By the way, if any other people of color pull this shit (and having passed for several other non-black races, I can guarantee due to experience, ya do), I'm gonna let you know that white people (and yes, some black people) do the exact same behind *your* back when they know they're talking to a black person.

"So I am Hispanic but tend to frequently get mistaken as white. When I inform others some of us are light skinned, some are aware but say it's more my features that pass off as European.

I was born in Socal so yes I will be more Americanized than my parents who were born in their native countries. I think it can be an assest when I sense the racism in the room. I feel perhaps other minorites will understand but the vibe ""this person is racist"" so then I will talk in a more valley voice to avoid any confrontation. Aside from one time I have never been a victim of hate crime & I am very grateful for that. I won't lie & say it doesn't have its advantage because yes unfortunately people do make assumptions based on race. I am also thin, tall & look fairly younger than my age so people are generally nice to me.. Unfortunately within the Hispanic culture there's a lot of colorism & lighter skinned Hispanics can sometimes think they're better than someone with more pigment in their skin. I have family members like that & for the life of me will never understand that toxic mindset. I've also had people confide their racism toward Hispanics but honestly I am usually in such shock when it happsn that I don't mention I am Hispanic as its usually a stranger.

I work with mostly Hispanics & they've never seen me as different aside from the jokes that I should be out in the sun more lol.

        his fury repeating itself

so precisely it became a joke
    we hollered through the halls,
        changing my friend’s name

to Goddamnit Nathaniel, as in
    Where the hell’s Goddamnit Nathaniel?
        I told you, Goddamnit, to get me a Coke!

which was stupid but funny at fourteen,
    and still just as stupidly funny at nineteen,
        when we’d yell across a bonfire,

Don’t bogart that joint, Goddamnit
    Nathaniel. Haven’t I told you
        to pass the fucking bong when you’re through?

which is still funny to me even now—
    even though I look back and see,
        as I could not have seen then,

that the Reverend Barker
    only stooped that way
        because he was dying,

because cancer was eating his liver,
    and because with each day it became
        both more urgent and more unlikely

that he would ever manage to say
    whatever it was he meant
        when he’d sit at the kitchen table,

or grip the black phone,
    or stand in the darkened driveway
        after we’d all gone home,

staring at the ground and saying nothing
    to his sweet, beloved boy
        but Goddamnit

Nathaniel, listen to me.
    Listen Goddamnit.
        Goddamnit Nathaniel, now listen.",1
"They made us memorize poems and recite them in school as part of the oral french grade. So i used to add a song’s tune to the poems to make it easier. 

Best one yet is by Victor Hugo

“Elle était déchaussée, elle était décoiffée/
Assise les pieds nus parmi les joncs penchants/
Moi qui passait par là je crus voir une fée/
Et je lui dit: veux-tu t’en venir dans les champs? “

Sitting with her bare feet in the tilting bulrushes/
As i passed by there i thought i saw a fairy/
And i asked her : want to go to the plains with me?)

Silly Old Baboon by Spike Milligan

There was once was a baboon
Who one afternoon
Said I think I will fly to the sun
So with two great palms
strapped to his arms
he started his takeoff run

Mile after mile
He galloped in style
But never once left the ground
You’re going too slow said a passing crow
Try reaching the speed of sound

SO
he put on a spurt
My God how it hurt
both the soles of his feet caught on fire
As he went through a stream
There were great clouds of steam
But he still never got any higher

On and on through the night
both his knees caught alight
clouds of smoke billowed out of his rear!!!
Quick to his aid
Came the fire brigade
who chased him for over a year

Many moons passed by
Did Baboon ever fly
Did he ever get to the sun?
I’ve just heard today,
he’s well on his way
He’ll be passing through Acton at one",1

He took his 3.2 test and became a 4.1 apprentice at his Electrical Union apprenticeship- the 3.2 year was the hardest one he's ever been in so far and he was busting his ass to pass it!,1
"He started a graduate program in January for Sports Journalism. He wants to be a sports writer. He was working in AV full time last year, making decent money, but he wasn't loving it, and he kept saying he how much he would love to talk about sports all day for a career. So I found him this program and we've been making it work financially. 

The program took a trip to Florida in the spring and he interviewed an up-and-coming MLB player. He wrote a really great article about it and it was published on Sportsnet. He FaceTimed me after and couldn't stop smiling. He was so humble about it that he could hardly believe it happened. 

He's been doing so well in school since then too, making amazing friends and making a wonderful impression on all the teachers. I can't wait to continue to watch him kick ass in something he's passionate about. ",1

Edit: it started as something fun to do on the side, and he's such a wonderful person that when people meet him they instantly love him and tell their friends and word gets out.

"It was recommended to me by an orthodontist, another said just lower surgery..  but I passed on both.  You're brave for going through that - I've read a lot about it and seen videos.

Try to keep busy as much as you can - books, tablet with internet, music, even keeping a blog of your progress can help...  stay in touch with friends and accept any help that comes your way.

From what I've heard, the swelling will go down and you will get your strength back..  it just takes a while.  This is MAJOR surgery and it's a lot to deal with.

Make sure you're taking in enough calories - smoothies fortified with protein poweder, peanut butter, full fat milk..  are all great (assuming your tummy is up for it).  If you can, take a very slow walk outside or sit in your backyard, just to get some air..  it will help with your mood.

Your end result will be amazing.  I've seen pictures.  People won't really know what's been done, you'll just look..  better and healthier.  Facial balance can make a big difference and you'll have the rest of your life to enjoy it.

Can I ask if you have an underbite / overbite?

My issue is an overbite and tiny lower jaw.  Like I mentioned, I opted out of surgery and am working with an excellent orthodontist who will do what he can with my jaw structure.  If I'm still unhappy at the end, I may look into a chin implant.

I'm mostly okay with face-on views of my face, it's just the side profile that looks off to me.",1
"I had double jaw surgery in February to fix my open bite and underbite. For me recovery was uncomfortable more than anything. 

I read some of your comments - swelling took a few months to completely go away but I felt like I looked human again at about three weeks, enough that no one in public would notice anything abnormal. At least until I tried to talk haha. The first week is the worst and you've already passed that milestone!

I still have partial numbness in some areas, and my upper gums are still completely numb.

Food was fun, I was on a liquid diet for 6 weeks. I actually didn't have soup that much so I didn't get sick of it! I had protein shakes with a banana blended in for breakfast, and soup or stew for lunch and dinner typically. I'd often blend up what my mum was having for dinner, watered or milked down so it could be syringed or sucked through a straw. Things like curry or bolognese were good. Canned stews and soups come in so many flavours now, chunky ones can easily be blended and watered down! I stayed away from anything with sugar in it for about three weeks until I felt I could clean my mouth properly. Also, eat foods high in fibre as soon as possible! Your bowels will thank you!

10 months later I am 100% happy with my decision to go through with jaw surgery. It has been totally worth it. I can eat properly and I look waaaaaay better than I did before.

Also, I made a blog to document my experience, let me know if you would like the link! Or if you have any questions. Good luck with your recovery, it should be all uphill from here :-)",1

"I recently (about a month back) stopped using oral contraception, after being on it for about 4-5 years (I'm 21 now, I was about 16 when I got on the pill). So my last period was also about a month back. Using pill made it so I always knew when to expect my period (how many pills left + 2-4 days, and my period would last about 4 days) and I became pretty complacent about keeping track of things in a more organised fashion (before that I used calendars and tried to meticulously record everything). Now that I'm off it, I don't know what to expect. I really dread getting my period unexpectedly, especially since they tended to be extremely painful and make it impossible for me to go about my day. That was under control while on the pill (worst case scenario, I'd be off my feet for only a day. If I couldn't get rest, I'd be able to work through it with a lot of painkillers).   
  
Pain management was primarily why I was initially prescribed the pill. Some days it would be so bad, I would just pass out while at school or just randomly on the road. Of course I stayed on the pill when I became sexually active (irrespective of condom use), seeing as it was still mainly the way for me to manage my pain, plus added safety. But for various reasons, I have now decided to go off it and see how it works. I am in a committed LTR, but my SO's work and mine makes it so we spend a some months each year, every year on different sides of the continent. We have been together 3 years, and don't expect our living scenario to change in the near future. So for a good part of the year, I'm on the pill for no other reason than because I take it when we're together. I've severe migraine issues, and my neurologist was concerned the OCP was interacting negatively with my medication (which mostly works, but I'll have a bad episode every now and then). He suggested I try other contraception to see if my headaches improved. So to that effect the gynaecologist I went to (not the same person who prescribed the pill, and it will not be possible to visit her again) suggested I stay off the pill when I'm not sexually active, if I did not want to rely on condoms alone (I am pretty confident I will not ""fall out"" of the habit of taking a pill, as I've literally never missed a pill in the years I was on it).  Regarding pain she said that now that I'm older things might be different/improved on that front, and that when younger my pain and subsequent symptoms (passing out, etc) were likely exacerbated by a congenital cardiac defect that I no longer have (been operated on successfully). She just said I should continue to rely on the pain medication I had been taking, except now that was all I'd have. She did have me get an ultrasound and also examined me physically, and everything is normal. 
  
So yeah, I think I've covered the facts of my situation, but I'll edit/reply to clarify if not. I'm not worried about being pregnant, I'm worried about well, getting my period. I feel like I'm 14 again. Any anecdotes, advice, really anything. The longer it gets, the more worried I am about possibilities like passing out while I'm at work or school, grossly underestimating how often I need to change, etc.",1

Edit: To anyone who may read this. If you have migraine and you take the pill, please consider going off the pill. There could be a connection between your migraines and your pill. It could also increase the risk for a stroke.

"My mom has stage 4 cancer and recently had a stroke and I feel like she might not be here for too much longer, be it a few days or another year. I feel like I'm wasting my last days with her.

My boyfriend jokes that I can be really morbid, but I have dozens of messages from her and anyone else whose left one.

 She's disoriented and cranky now, I'll try to get some stories out of her in a couple days when she's feeling more herself. 

She had a seizure on Wednesday morning about 3am and has just woken up from that and she's doing alright now, so hopefully she'll be out in a few days.

Edit 2:  I've been living with mom for the past 6 months since she got diagnosed, which I feel is a huge advantage since I've been able to spend a bunch of time with her these past 6 months.  She even called me her best daughter, when I was always #2 of 3 (parents pretend they don't have favorites, we all know better).  She knows how much I love her and she sees all the things I do to make her comfortable and happy.  I know how much she loves me and she's said her entire life that her girls are her pride and joy and the best thing to happen to her (except the teenage years for me and one sis) so even if she were to die unexpectly, or hell, even months ago I'd still know deep in my heart for the rest of my life that we knew how much we cared about eachother.",1

 If not, what were the broad strokes, were they more authoritarian, more permissive? How did they handle discipline? How did they handle you transitioning to adulthood?

Were you able to communicate with them? Did you feel loved and respected? Do you feel they helped you become effective and healthy adults? If not, are there specific things you can pinpoint as problems caused by their parenting style?

"A little background: My boss is originally from China and he and I share a fairly friendly professional relationship. After some conversations with him, I learned:

b) he had two incredibly smart dogs as a kid in China whom he trained to do errands 

I do freelance graphic art in my spare time and have considered doing a painting for him in a traditional Chinese brush stroke style showing a guy fishing with his two dogs playing nearby.

"I'm currently in the middle of a storm with my mother.

She is 62 years old and had surgery on her spine last Tuesday. She seemed completely fine on Wednesday. On Thursday she seemed groggy. I chocked it up to the surgery wearing her out. 

On Friday I couldn't reach her on the phone. She lives about 30 minutes from me. My SO and I were going to go to have dinner at his parents who live about 15 minutes from her. With the feeling I had in my gut I decided to drive separately and check on her before dinner. I never made it to dinner. 

I walked in on my mother slumped over on the couch, telling me there were bugs crawling all over the floor and that there were people in the house hitting the cats and moving her things. The house was a mess, and medicine bottles were open on the night stand, but she claimed she couldn't find them. She was telling me about things that had never existed in the house( ""What did you do with the passage way to the bathroom. It was right here!"" as she tried to walk behind the couch into the wall) About things that hadn't happened in years. I called 911 and had her taken to the hospital. 

At the hospital she was diagnosed with sepsis (fully body infection), memory loss, and hallucinations. They transferred her from the hospital 15 minutes from me to the hospital that she had her surgery in 2 hours away. The ER doctor straight up told me that they didn't want to take the blame if what was happening had something to do with the surgery. 

Since then, its been waiting on her memory to return and for her body to get back to normal. She has been slowly getting better, can hold a normal conversation, can walk around and slowly do things now. She has no memory of what happened. Absolutely nothing. Doesn't remember anything between Thursday night to sometime Monday. This is the second time this has happened this year and I still have no definitive answers from the doctors. The first time this happened I'm not aware there were any hallucinations, but she couldn't remember anything including how to put underwear on. It was as if she had regressed to being a 2 year old. 

I'm getting concerned about her health and well being. I'm not even sure where to start with how to get her the care she needs. I've started looking into senior living facilities but all of them are far more expensive than I can even begin to touch. There is one place in the area that is income based, but there is an obviously long waiting list. I'd move her in with me, but she has 3 cats, I have one of my own, and I'm living with my SO and a roommate and we don't have the room for four more beings in the house. 


I'm not even sure where to start looking. Is there a thing where people can come and check on a person once or twice a day? I'd prefer that if something happens she'd be able to get in contact with someone quickly, or I'd be able to call and see if they can check on her. 

I'm tired of feeling like I'll have not heard from her for a day or so and I walk into her dead on the floor. Its only me as far as her family goes. My uncle exists, but hes currently in the process of trying to get a brain tumor removed and lives about an hour and a half away.

I’ve even seen people here say that once you’re 25, you’re not “young” anymore (this is also implied when I see posts targeted towards “older women”, 25 is always the cutoff age)? O_o Tbh it makes me feel kinda nervous (and old)...idk it seems arbitrary? I mean, is 25 generally considered “older”?",1

"I was recently informed by a member of this community that all women love cheesecakes. I quote:

> big coronary artery blocking globs of cheese and sugar slathered in sugary sauce

She also claimed to be plural and speak for all women, so maybe she's not quite all there?

(I used the search function, and the only use of the word ""cheesecake"" was something about leftover oreos and cream cheese).

"Hello, I could really use some help. I am a 17 year old girl and recently (the past 6 months maybe), I decided to try to improve my cardiovascular health and also build muscle, as well as eat healthier. I have been running and hitting the weight circuit 3 or 4 times a week consistently. I've been a vegetarian since childhood but am eating better than ever- almost no processed foods, lots of lean protein like greek yogurt and cottage cheese, blah blah blah. I cannot make it clear enough, however, THIS IS NOT TO LOSE WEIGHT, just to get healthier. At 5' 1"" and 105 lbs, I'm at a good weight. So here's my issue. I haven't gotten my period the past 4 months. I've lost 3 lbs accidentally the past 6 months, but I have been eating enough and 105 is still an acceptable BMI. I feel like I should go to the doctor or something, but I'm scared to tell my mother why I need to go. She is slightly overweight and overreacts to a healthy diet and exercise-she thinks I've been excessive and unhealthy, and is always encouraging me to eat more dessert and exercise less. If I tell her about this I'm scared it'll be an ""I told ya so!"" and a demand that I pick back up my previous habits.

What do I do? Should I just not go to the doctor? What's the worst that could happen? Will my body adjust to this new routine and start ovulating again? Please help!!
EDIT: thank you guys. I talked to my mom and I'm seeing my doctor next week",1

I'd probably be worried about her upon first seeing a heart surgery scar.",0
"Doesn't matter.  I had a big crush on this girl from one of my chemistry classes in college (her lab bench was across from mine) who happened to have a heart surgery scar.

"2 years ago I briefly was seeing a girl with a scar from open heart surgery she had as a pre-teen.  She needed another one about a year before we met so it was a scar over another scar.

It didn't bother me one bit. What bothered me more is that she was overly rude to everyone and called me an idiot in a very rude way so I ditched her.",0
"Oh no.  Buddy.  Look, you’re trying and I think we see you’re trying.

From your comments I think you have an aortic graft, in my entire career I’ve never heard of someone carrying around tourniquet. I’ve seen plenty of patients with this that have robust lives. If you are having pain with negative scans it is not from your vessels. Counseling sounds like a fantastic idea.  Don’t let life pass you by with the “what if’s” .",0

"No what you feel is normal. Esp with a parent that doesn’t take care of themselves. That shit is hard to deal with. My dad died last year from multiple heart attacks, coded in my face. He was also diabetic. When I cleaned out his fridge it was filled with mt dew and whatever else that he wasn’t supposed to drink and eat. You can try to help but you can’t make them listen.

"Well, my dad died when I was in my early 20s. I was older than you, but still basically a kid. 

The first few of years were rough, especially since it really changed the way my family interacted. A major focal point for all of us was gone. We all kind of scattered. I honestly dealt with it by drinking too much, and distracting myself with music and movies and trivia. It numbed my head and helped me smile and forget, but resulted in 3-4 wasted years. 

I still think about the guy often, but it doesn't hurt now (almost 20 years since he passed).

It still hits me like a ton of bricks in certain situations. My 3-year-old boy asked me where my daddy was the other day, and why he couldn't meet him. Not easy to answer. Other times, I just smile when I catch myself using one of his old expressions. 

Advice? I don't know, man. Try to maintain strong friendships, stay in touch with your family even when they piss you off, allow time to pass, and do the kind of stuff that would make him proud. Use the time that you have. Distance and life experiences are the only things that will really heal you. Sorry for the clichés, but it's all I got. ",0
"It was not my direct experience, but I was with my wife for about 6 months when her father died. He actually had a heart attack before she and I got together, but we were friends, and that actually brought us a bit closer, since she didn't really seem to have anyone who was checking on her or her situation.

Their relationship had been rocky since she was a kid, but within the last few months prior, they had come back together, he had really worked on curbing his drinking (he was an alcoholic, and apparently not a very nice one), and they were seeing each other regularly. She was finally able to have that bond she had wanted, and then it was ripped away from her. 

He never fully recovered, and was bed-ridden from that point on. He showed some signs of possibly being able to walk again, and was working on his speech, but it eventually got to a stopping point. I believe he stopped at around the mental capacity near a 4-5 year old, and was not strong enough to feed himself.

Eventually he was sent home from the care facility, and he began to decline a bit more rapidly. He stopped eating, and lost weight quickly.

Once he got that sick, my wife (girlfriend at the time) went and saw him more regularly. 

Eventually he passed, and I was actually out of town working at the time. She was crushed, and at 18 had to help plan her father's funeral. I cannot imagine her feeling.

She actually came to work with me for several days, because she actually couldn't handle being at work, or sitting at home alone after they sent her home. She would just cry at certain points, after something would remind her of him.

Later that week, we went to his funeral (fitting weather, dreary, rainy, and cool), and that was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. She was obviously broken up about it, and once the ceremony started, it was horrible. Seeing her so crushed and upset really got to me. She said her goodbyes, and we went and spent some time with her grandparents, since they lived close by. We hung out for a few hours, but still had a number of hours to drive back.

She asked me if we could stop by the grave site one more time before going home. Little did I know, the hardest part was coming.

We went back out to the grave site, her still upset, but not currently crying. We walked back out to his plot, and the tears just started up again. I asked her if she wanted some time alone, and she said yes. I walked away to give her some space, and just watched from a distance. I've never seen anything just crush me and make me cry like that. Seeing a daughter who had finally been able to re-kindle her relationship with her father, and then that was ripped from her within a year's time, and having to say goodbye in a secluded graveyard in the dreary rain was something I don't think I've ever felt such sorrow over. And it wasn't even my father.

I do often times have questions for her about how she's doing, I try to not ask too much as I don't want to continually bring him up, but I don't know what it's like, I've never been through it. 

She tells me she has her good days and bad days, but that it can hurt just as badly on some of the worst bad days. The bad days seem to lessen in frequency, but I'm sure they will probably never go away entirely. I just try to make sure I'm there for her when she needs me. ",0
"My Dad was fobbed off by our GP for 10 months with a terrible cough. He was told he had a chest infection and was put on antibiotics, they didn't work so he returned to be told it was an ""inner lung and chest infection"" with stronger antibiotics he was again sent home. He went back when the course was finished with no releif and was told it was a ""deep rooted inner lung and chest infection"" and sent home with an even stranger mix of antibiotics. My Dad was a private and shy man and very rarely complained or visited a Doctor so when he eventually couldn't make it 7 steps from his car door to our front door without turning a charcoal grey colour in his face I put my foot down got him in the car and drove him to our nearest walk in centre. He was seen to by the nurses in the passenger seat of the car and was immediately blue lighted to the hospital where they discovered he had Advanced Lung Cancer and due to the severe strain on his heart and lungs his pericardum sac surrounding his heart had also filled with fluid and was barely beating. He died in hospital 6 weeks later. 

Our GP practice was 9 houses down at the top of our street and on the day of my Dads funeral the GP came to our house offered his apologies and swore he would never forgive himself and announced he needed to retire because ""his heart can not live with his mistake"". He was an 89 year old Doctor we later found out who should not have been practising. My Dad was 44.",0
"Not so much a lie, as just terrible care.

I had this thing where once in a blue moon I would pass out. Didn't have any known stressers (if i had eaten lately, or what i had eaten, tempurature of the room, etc all differed.)

My aunt is a NP and as we are close she is often the one we go to, but I have a primary that is a full dr for things that are out of her depth or for running blood tests/signing off on physicals, etc. I will never go back to this lady.

The first time I went to her was after I had almost passed out in class, and she wrote it off as a fluke and that i just had low blood sugar because I didn't eat breakfast. Whatever.

It would keep happening once every couple of months or whatever, with it mostly being me standing and i could feel it coming on, and the next time we saw her she ran a heart test, and then told me it was fine now go away.

Uh, its not normal for my body to shut down randomly, you wanna try that again sis? Nope. ""I could take away your license if you really think this is that big of an issue"". Bitch threatened to take away a life of independence (no public transport here, and would be very hard to get back if its withdrawn by medical person) because I wanted more than a ""some people just faint, sucks to suck"".

I never figured out what it was and we went to a heart specialist and another doc as well, but it hasn't happened for years now. I'm still pissed at that doc for threatening a scared teen because their body liked to randomly shut down.",0
"This is random, but I actually had a similar condition growing up. It started when I was like 15 after getting accidentally kicked in the face in the pool. I passed out then and was pulled from the pool. I was told I was convulsing, so everyone thought it was a seizure. Over the next several years I had several unprompted ""seizures"" where I would feel it coming on, pass out and sometimes convulse. My parents took me to several neurologists who confirmed I wasn't epileptic, and they also sent me to a heart specialist who said I was fine there too. I did EEG's, sleep studies, all kind of tests but I never could get a solid answer as to what was causing it from Doctors. It was never by lack of sleep/nutrition.

It continued into college and would happen once or twice a year. Happened once on a subway on a trip to NYC, thankfully was able to quickly tell the friends I was with what was about to happen. I usually could predict it about 5 mins beforehand. I would get a headache, feel lightheaded, hear a ringing and get a sort of tunnel vision. Few times I would feel it coming on while driving. I would pull over immediately, pass out, rest for a bit until I felt good, then continue driving.

Finally a new neurologist examined me. His diagnosis was that these were actually a rare/severe form of migraine that exhibited all the same symptoms as seizures. I'm not sure if I trust that, since he was the only neurologist I saw that claimed it.

Regardless I'm 27 now and haven't had one since I was 23.",0

"Might want to post over at /r/migraine, but a lot of that sounds like migraine. Mine sometimes cause severe fatigue where I start nodding off and can't stop. Though that's a bit different than passing out it could be a similar mechanism. Migraines are basically just electrical signals in the brain gone wonky so they can cause all kinds of weirdness.",0
"Mine was really nice.

The ultrasound I got came back all good and the heart specialist was all ""I get why you came, but between this and the EKG, I'm confident in saying your heart is not the issue. I can send you next door to neurology in case it is a brain thing or nutrition if it's a blood sugar thing or order another set of blood tests done if you can get in right after an episode, but we are just guessing at this point. As long as you can feel it coming on and get yourself safe (not on stairs or driving) then your best bet is to just hope it passes as time goes on. If this is still an issue in a few years or it gets worse then I'd start visiting specialist again. Until then it will be a lot of expensive tests taking a shot in the dark""",0
"I should have been more clear; My doctor put me on more than the required mg dosage for my medication (Topiramate) When I went to see a new doctor, she made a passing remark that I was on so much that it could kill me.

"I could always feel it coming on, and only one instance was while sitting that I felt well in advance. I completely understand why passing out while driving would be terrible, for me and others, it just did not apply well to my case IMO, and was agreed on by everyone until I dare show concern over her lack of diagnosis. 

Even having the name of it would have been very helpful in alleviating our fears, or even just some general medical terms that could describe what was happening should we ever need to tell another medical professional. I think a large part of being a family doctor is being able to explain why you are it aren't doing something so the patient understands, and she very well shit the bed on this one.",0
"I am a nurse, i got off on the wrong level on an elevator.  Went through some doors, didnt realize but i was in a hall way between a whole bunch of theaters where people were getting/doing heart surgery.

"I know a lot of it, man, I do. Well, I don't know of the health conditions nor the suicide, but I know of the connection, the late calls, the staying there together in the room just hugging for support. Followed by her passing away. That I know.

Do your best to keep fed and hydrated. It's okay to be selfish and throw silent tantrums for a while, you won't success if you try not to anyway. I know I spent most of my time in front of her tomb for a couple weeks, just a place with nobody around to annoy me where I could freely let go and reminiscing of our memories together. You do you.

The excruciating pain is inevitable. But it will slowly fade, and eventually away. Try to let it hurt, and accept that it's natural that you would feel that for your friend. It will come back on occasion, just like it is for me right now, though.

If you're convinced that as you are right now, a funeral is not what can help you, it's okay. Find your own way to try and say goodbye, when you can say goodbye. You two were close enough to have your special things.

The people around you will see you and know you're hurting, so you don't really need to tell about it to keep them informed. But for me, it's the living who were left, who helped me slowly go back to want to function in life. Opening up to the people who would let me. It can start with something as inane as ""it hurts"" or ""I can't stop crying"" or anything true about how you feel. It will flow naturally, the point is just to not keep it bottled up.

See if you want to keep physical mementos of her (or maybe numeric on physical support,) and start planning how to ensure you preserve it and never lose it. In twenty years you'll still want to sometimes look at them.

Time will help you buddy, but I know what's it like. Hang in there. There is nothing to do about the hurt but let it hurt. But it's okay. And you'll go forward sooner than you think.

"I'm so so sorry about all of this. None of it is fair, or right. I wish I could wrap you up in a hug and tell you everything's going to be alright, but instead I'll leave you with this. It always helps me when I'm grieving. 

Original comment by /u/GSnow

-----

Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.

I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.

Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.",0
"Firstly I am so sorry for your loss.

Now I am going to tell you a story that I hope helps you accept her decision.

A friend/former coworker lost his wife about seven years ago to cancer. She had battled it off and on for nearly thirty years, breast, skin, some kind of lymphoma and finally colon. We sometimes would go out for a beer and he would talk to me about her, about her fight and about his guilt. About a year or so early when she was diagnosed for tbe fourth time she was tired and suffering and asked him to leave his gun when he went out, he knew what this meant and decided that he couldn't he convinced her that suicide was not the answer. Then while talking to me he started crying. ""If I had known what she'd be going through now I would have let her.""  It was then that he told me what he hadn't told anyone, the cancer had spread up her spinal cord, she had minimal use of one arm and no use of her other three limbs, she was blind in one eye and in so much pain that constant morphine did virtually nothing. ""I didn't let her go because I was selfish."" 

She passed a few days later and he confessed to me that he remembered the good times but that he could never shake the image of the pain ravaged shell of the woman he'd loved since he was 14.

Remember the good times you and your friend shared, remember the strength you gave each other and the love you had between you but don't let it eat at you. Share that love you have with others.",0
"She saw and felt your pain.  Just as you saw and felt hers.  The beautiful thing is that your love for each other conquered the pain and suffering while you both held on to each other.

Many people see suicide as a product of mental illness.  They don't understand the physical pain and suffering that can lead to it.  Even in instances of ""mental illness"", it is the physical,chemical imbalance causing the tremendous pain.

You gave the greatest gift to your friend.  Compassion, you gave caring at the hardest of times.  You comforted her when most turn away because sometimes love hurts.  I learned this helping as my father was dying, wasting away from a terrible disease.

You have done nothing shameful.  Your parents should be proud they raised someone as caring as you.  Your friend was lucky to have someone like you.
",0
"First off, I am so sorry for your loss. I can't imagine what you have been feeling.

As a therapist myself, I want you to know that whatever you are feeling is ok. Grief encompasses myriad feelings, from despair to anger; even joy, and so on. Grief is not a linear process, so the best thing to do right now is to be fair to yourself, regardless of what you may be thinking and feeling, even if it doesn't seem quite right. Like other commenters have stated, I would recommend seeking outpatient treatment with a licensed therapist who specializes in grief counseling. I am not a specialist myself in this particular area, but I've seen it work wonderfully for many people I've referred.

If you do decide to begin treatment, allow yourself time to build a trusting relationship with the clinician. S/he will go at your pace and support you along this process.  I hope this helps and finds you in a good place.",0

"Good advice here. First thing is not to let yourself get on a downward spiral. Get up in the mornings. Get a shower. Shave. Eat. Go for a run/bike ride/swim. Take care of yourself. Remember that she was awesome, and that the hurt is a kind of internal memorial to her. It gets easier over time. It doesn't hurt less; you get used to it. I still miss my best friend (passed away 7 years ago suddenly from the flu in his 20s). But it doesn't surprise me anymore. Now I can miss him and smile at the same time. If you know some of her friends or family, maybe reach out to them - they're feeling what you're feeling. If you go to church, talk to your pastor - this is what they gear up for. 

TL; DR: take care of yourself, the rest will come. ",0
"At our last family reunion, I shared a hotel room with my dad. We ended up drinking a case of beer  in the room at the end of the night and talking about my late mother. Eventually I cried telling him how proud I was of him, and how lucky I was to be his son for everything he’s taught me. 

We really never did anything like that before my mom passed, so it was really nice to have that moment with him. I’ll always remember that night fondly.",0
"Just wanted to chime in cause I have the same thing you two are talking about. I run two chest days a week (about) and it's consistently becoming less noticeable.

"This isn't an blow off answer, but talk to a doctor.  Just because you're a guy in your early/mid-20s, I'm going to take a shot in the dark and assume you haven't gotten your annual physical yet.  These are free under most insurance plans (even the high deductible ones) as they fall under preventative care and not only will you know where things stand now, but a primary care doctor will definitely be able to point you in the best direction based on the specific factors which may be contributing to your family's history of heart disease (high cholesterol, high blood pressure, etc).",0
"Die young or live in a bubble. 

Seriously though, I don't believe those of us with a family history has any choice in the matter. My father had a quad in his late 50's. He was/is 5'6"" 120 pounds soaking wet. He is an avid martial artist and eats relatively well (an occasional hefty steak) and drinks a glass of wine a night (better than the cognac when he was younger). After his heart attack he ate even better and still had a second one in his 60's. 

My father's dad, grandfather, and brother have all had heart attacks. My mom's father and brothers all had heart attacks. I have **no hope** of not having one soon (I'm in my late 40's). 

This doesn't count the family type 2 diabetes. Everyone except my father and mother have it on both sides. And no, they aren't all fat. We just don't make the cut for Type 1. 

IMHO: It comes down to how you recover from family illness and not will you have it. My dad is still super active. To the point my brother and I yell it him to slow down and let us do it for him. He refuses to let a heart attack control his life. I hope I'm that strong when it is my turn to face mine. ",0
"Eat healthy, exercise, don't smoke, and learn to manage stress. 

Heart disease runs in my family too. My dad had a heart attack when he was 52. He was/is very fit. In fact, he'd run a 10k the day before and won his age group, and was a Boston-caliber marathon runner when he did longer runs. Before that, his mom had a heart attack and quadruple bypass. Several of his family members have similar stories as well. 

His cardiologist actually mentioned that my brother and I should start getting screened for heart disease when we turn 40 since there is such a strong family history. It might be worth looking into when you're older. In the meantime just take the best care of yourself that you can. ",0
"Thanks, I don't intend to live in a bubble my family is fairly active with family trips encompassing hiking, mountain biking, white water rafting, horseback riding and the occasional ski trip in winter. Summer weekends are spent on the lake wake-boarding with some fishing in-between. 

I just got the call from my dad this morning, and it was definitely a wake-up call. My step moms been taking it seriously for the last decade since my grandfather passed, making sure my dad eats healthier. And I think its time for me to take some extra steps and precautions while I'm still relatively young and can make those adjustments to my lifestyle as needed. I wish all the best to you and your family. ",0
"My mother has Parkinson’s and I work professionally with adults with learning disabilities, so I know the type of frustration you must be feeling.
One thing I always find helpful is to read up on whatever condition it might be etc so I have an understanding of what is happening biologically within the individual, this really helps me to rationalise what is happening if someone is being slow, or not responding etc

Another good thing to do is to find tools or techniques to make it easier for the individual to communicate- be it picture cards or just asking yes or no questions so it doesn’t require so much effort to answer on their part. It’s great to hear that your dad is really working on his communication- perhaps you could offer to help him? Does he have exercises from a speech therapist? Perhaps you can go through them with him- that will not only help him, but help you to understand his level of ability or at the very least you will become more used to his new way of communicating.

It is ALWAYS hard when something life changing happens to someone you love- I resented my mum for having Parkinson’s for a long time, because I I think deep down I felt like she was always going to be the strong presence in my life and the model I based myself from, and in my eyes she was crumbling away and it made me scared. But time has passed and I understand what is happening to her body and in her brain and why it’s happening. And now I love and respect her more than I thought I ever could.

Fatty foods, no exercise, being overweight, high stress levels and genetics can all play a role.  You choose what and how you live so you have a lot of power over this.  Start living well today, it all counts.

He was naturally predisposed to high cholesterol and it caught up.  Fortunately he was close to medical care and after surgery, he recovered well.

"I had a heart attack on 11/29/2017. So first of all, I had no idea what was happening. The pain was intense but there was also this feeling of overwhelming dread. When I arrived at the ER they rushed me right past everyone and took amazing care of me (VA hospital). I spent two days in the ICU then went home. 

All in all, it was a mild one and I emerged no worse for the wear. Subsequent tests have revealed that that was, in fact, my 2nd heart attack, the first one having been misdiagnosed as a panic attack. 

So anyway, it hurts, A LOT, but they give you morphine fast and your chances of survival are quite high.",0
"Heart problems run in the family and I always believed that I would be dead by 40. I believed it so much so that I built a lifestyle around that ideal. I never worried about it and just accepted it, living my life to the fullest.

At 40 the heart attack did not come and I was disappointed. At 45 it showed up and almost killed me. I have had two subsequent heart attacks since then, neither of which I worried about, and now at 49 I do not worry about another one.

Look friend you need to live your life and not worry about death. I was clinically dead for eight and a half minutes and there was nothing scary about it at all. What you may fear is the panic before death and that my friend is something entirely different.",0

And don't listen to all these health nuts that tell you it's all about life choices and diet and shit. My heart is deformed through no fault of my own. You can spend your life running marathons and eating nothing but tree bark and bird shit and still drop dead of a heart attack anytime.",0
"Mine was strange. I did yard work until about 11 am because it was supposed to be blazing hot that day, when I came in I didn't necessarily feel short of breath but felt like I couldn't breathe in deeply. I brushed it off thinking maybe it was a pollen reaction and laid down and took about an hour nap. Woke up and felt fine the rest of that day. Then I started to have some soreness in my shoulder area about midnight that night as I was laying in bed, but when I sat up it went away so again I ignored it. It kept coming and going but eventually got worse, I still thought no big deal because I didn't have any other symptoms at all. At about 1 am the pain spread down my left arm and up my neck and I told my wife time to go to the ER. Of the 5 major arteries feeding the heart, I had 3 that were 100% blocked and the other 2 were around 40%. I had heart surgery the next morning and ended up with 3 stents. Looking back, I'm lucky I woke up from my nap!",0

"Welllll it took three different doctors and two hospitals six years to actually diagnose me with a cardiac problem.

Yeah. I’d go in with chest pain, back pain, left arm numb.

They ER’s would hook me up to EKG machines, do x-rays, draw blood... and then send me home saying I wasn’t having a heart attack.

The Docs would have me run on treadmills with EKG machines... and then send me home saying I wasn’t having a heart attack.

Stomach docs would prescribe more and more stomach meds that consistently didn’t work.

Finally after six years a *nurse*, watching me run in pain on a treadmill and an EKG machine (with normal EKG), said “You know what? I’m tellin that doc you need a nuclear stress test.”

Thankfully the doc agreed because the nuke found an “abnormality” on the left side of my heart.

The cardiac cath showed that “abnormality” to be a 99% block of the LAD (The Widowmaker).

One big ass metal soda straw later and I’m climbing up stairs and bicycling pain free.

But not symptomatic free.

I still get the same symptoms I had before, just not after exercise.

Turns out the nerves for “you’re having a heart attack” pain *are the exact* same nerves for “you’re having bad indigestion” pain.

Know what causes indigestion besides bad sushi?

Anxiety that’s what.

Anxiety and stress cause acid buildup and GERD and esophagitis.

Which causes more anxiety because everytime I go to the ER they draw blood, take an X-ray, hook me up to an EKG machine...and send me home sayin “You’re not having a heart attack”.

Here’s what I’ve learned about cardiac problems:

If you want to save someone’s life, carry chewable aspirin with you.

Aspirin and CPR has almost an order of magnitude better success rate over CPR alone.

Do Not just start taking aspirin without talking to a doc.
Even 81mg aspirin can mess you up over the long term.

STOP EATING SO MUCH SUGAR

No really. Sugar irritates the arterial walls and allows for cholesterol to collect on the walls.

I know. Its tough finding any food in a box or bottle which doesn’t have “added sugar” but it’s doable.

Alcohol counts as sugar.

Get up and move.

Go for walks.

Bike.


Fuck for a healthy heart.

Ok I’m done now.

Don’t have a heart attack.

"Start slow. Don’t overwhelm yourself with the intimidation of everything about weight lifting when you’re a rookie. 

Machines can be good. But in general, especially at your level, focus on barbells and free weights. The main exercises you want to prioritize are:

Bench/chest press. Pectoral fly. Shoulder press. Shrugs. Lat pulls downs. Horizontal rows. Dead lift. Squats. 

For biceps do curls. For triceps, overhead extensions and pull downs will give you a nice burn. 

Prioritize compound exercises. They will give you the greatest benefit early on. Compound exercises engage multiple muscle groups in the body and you’ll reap the biggest benefit. 

It’s true; never skip leg day. Your legs contain large muscles. If you neglect to activate these large muscles, you’re doing yourself a disservice throughout the week and wasting opportunity to kick start results. 

Start slow. It’s better to do a little consistently than to do a lot every now and then.

Continue with your cardio, but prioritize the weightlifting.

Prisoners get absolutely jacked over time and often have minimal access to fancy machines and weights. They rely on body weight and worthwhile exercises. Push ups. Sit ups. Crunches. Pull ups. Dips. Start trying to work these body weight exercises in when you get comfortable.",0

"Not advice, but empathy.

Brother...  I got out of a toxic relationship with a woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.  I loved the 50% of her that was kind, fun, funny, and a real pal.  Unfortunately, 50% of someone is just not good enough.  The other half was controlling, stubborn, nagging, domineering, and completely unreasonable.  We fought constantly, because I never actually let her control me. I'm too independent for that. Nonetheless, I saw something in her that made me want to share a lifetime together.  I only saw the good part.  She left me on several occasions, only to make up with me.  I finally noticed the pattern:  She would always leave me after we had a *wonderful* time out together; really wonderful, romantic evenings at her favourite places.  I finally figured out that she would leave me because she didn't want to get ""stuck"" with me.  I make a comfortable living for a single guy.  But she wanted more.  She has more money than I do, and so she didn't want to get stuck with a man ""below her station"" according to her traditional mother.  Fk did that hurt.  It's hypergamy, and very real.  She's now with someone who makes more than I do. 

The good:  I'm out of it, now.  And better off for it.

The bad:  I'm still in love with her, and there hasn't been a night in 2 years that I've gone to bed not thinking about her.  But while I was with her, I suffered chest pains, heart palpitations, and strange headaches.  All test results negative; stress induced.

Your only choice:  Get as far away as you can, as quickly as you can.   You'll be miserable, and that's normal.  But KNOW that you're executing the ONLY choice.  I'm not much for seeking help, so I can't refer you down any avenues. But just know you're not the only one, and that being out there alone, licking your wounds is FAR better than constantly being wounded over, and over again.  GET OUT OF THERE.  Clean up whatever remaining business you have with her, if any, and ghost.  Bid a good riddance to bad rubbish, even though you still love her.  I get it.  But there's no choice. She's gone. And yes, you'll have to wrap your head around the idea that another man is with her.  And that fkn hurts like a bitch, but that's the way it is.  Now, it's character time.

Good luck, brother.",0

My mum wasn't a case of clogged arteries, it was stress that triggered an underlying heart condition she didn't know she had. No collapse, no left arm hurting, instead she had terrible indigestion and was so short of breath and had terrible chest pain that she could barely walk up a flight of stairs.

"Hello, 

I was in the same situation a bit more than one year ago. My father had a lymphoma (cancer also). He died after fighting for 2 years. We thought he was cured because the scan did not show anything and finally the cancer came back. 

I send you all my support. I know it is not easy at all..

First of all, don't only ask things to your father but don't forget to tell him everything you need to tell him. My father was my model and I did not say that to him explicitly. I still regret it.

- if your father had a strong passion, you should ask him what unforgettable moments he had. My father was a soccer player and he taught me a lot of moments before dying. I will be able to explain this to my children. Same about your father's job.

- ask your father to give you advices about life. His point of view. Because at the end, this is all about this, not about making more money or have more materials. The goal of life.

- ensure that he knows that you and your family are in safe hands. Reassure him.

- buy anything that can make him happy. For my father at the end, it was some sweets.

Take time off to be close to your father and family during these difficult times..

I was living in Ireland when my father got informed that he has a cancer (a second one, first one was cured. My father was not drinking, not smoking, a sportsman... Here we are). Hopefully my company was giving sick leave for a family member and I was able to visit them several times. I finally decided to leave Ireland to come back to my own country, France which allowed me to be there during his last months and moments. Right now, I can tell that I would exchange anything if I had to do it again. I know that I made the good choice. .

I wish you good luck to you, your family and your father,",0

"So, here’s my advice. I lost my dad a couple months ago, and once it started everything went so fucking fast it feels like a blur in retrospect. My dad had dementia that was a lot worse than I realized before he got sick, and it progressed exponentially faster after a heart attack. I couldn’t really do much to make quality time, or squeeze life advice out of him.  

What I could do was be there literally every waking moment I wasn’t at work to care for him his last few months. I never let him see me get frustrated. I never cried. I was perpetually understanding. I held his hand and told him I love him. I sat at his side when he couldn’t take it anymore and he entered the active dying phase until he breathed his last breath. It took 24 hours. I carried the weight of all his suffering, and all the fear and anxiety we went through as a family, on my own shoulders. Because I knew it was temporary and I knew he deserved the best I could give him. He left this world with his son at his side through everything, repaying all the love he gave me through a life time. Proving to him in his final moments that he raised a man he could be proud of. 

My dad was older. I always knew this would happen one day, and I knew that I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I wasn’t there for him when he needed me. It’s hard. It’s harder than you think it will be. But I can look back now and know I did everything right. I was everything he deserved. And now, I can move forward with no regrets and be proud of the man I was when he needed me most.

TLDR: I’m only a few years older than you. It’s hard, but just make sure to be there. For everything. No matter how difficult. He’ll be gone soon from your perspective, but what you do now is literally forever for him.",0

"As a person who’s mother had them at 45. I totally totally understand trying to find a way to accept that you may not have a parent like everyone else around, I know I’m not going to be thirty and have a mom and it makes me so frustrated and mad and I cry about it. Feel like I’m just waiting. She’s had a stroke and had pre diabetes and won’t do much to change her health. It makes me so fucking sad she won’t take care of herself.. sometimes I feel bad she had to have me at 45 and be subjected to all these health issues. The only advice I have is.. do your best. My dad is 70ish also. I’m 22. My mom 67. It’s heavy dude it really is",0
"First off, I hope you have a lot more years with him.  Perhaps age is nothing but a number, truly, even though I know a landmark number is approaching.

Second, I'd like to add that it is good of you, and how it should be, that a young man think of his father in a complimentary way.  As a father to two girls, I don't want to do anything to make them have less faith in me, than I have in myself.  

Last thing: I lost my father at his age of 53.  He died suddenly, and without health warning.  Just dropped.  He and I and a few others were playing a game of pick up basketball, which he loved.  He had become much more fit as he had gotten older, as my sister and I were needing less from his income, each of us married and moved on with our lives, individually.  He was no longer chained down to his job, so he felt new and envigored to play sports, and do things he missed for 20 years.  Lost tons of weight.  But, a heart issue, undiagnosed, took him too soon.  I still love him, and it's now been 17 years since his passing, when I was 27 at the time, and now, in my mid 40's.  I think of my age approaching his when he passed, and I'm conscious of changes that are perhaps even subtle, to my own health.

Spend time with him, if you can.  No one is guaranteed tomorrow, not even you or I.  He loves you.  He saw you from the moment you came into this world, when you knew nothing of what living was.  When his time comes to depart this world, you will be sad, of course.  But you will be left with good memories, hopefully, as I am.",0

"I can relate. My father turns 71 next month, diabetic, no health problems from it so far but you never know. I don't relate to him a lot. He just does the same stuff he's always done, tells the same stories, eats the same stuff he's always eaten (frozen meat dinners while I'm vegetarian) and we have almost no shared interests. But on the flip side, my mother passed away in February. So I know too well how important it is to use the time you have with them. And a lesson was that GOOD MEMORIES together are important to cultivate because they'll be what you use to cope when the person is gone. Just seems like with my dad I'm going to have to be the creative one of us two if I want to have any memories to look back on. 

One thing I decided to start to do? Cook. Healthy stuff. It will benefit me but also give him better food to eat.

Word to the wise: bruschetta is super easy to make. It''s like buttered toast's health-conscious cousin. But white bread is no bueno for diabetics, bread in general should be in moderation, but I use whole grain. Still tastes good. Whole wheat also better than white.",0
"That's something that ought to happen, especially if you're the eldest (and he's no longer married).

I'm a paramedic by trade so intimately aware of how messy and horrible this can go.

I'm my father's MPOA, and was made that just prior to him having heart surgery.

He was also in the ICU for 3 days before he called me (which sparked all of this). I forced that conversation on him.

But rather for myself I keep that as a goal in regards to fulfilment in terms of what and who I want to be and should be. If I am not with a girl that likes me as a man, I don't really feel like one. So I guess I might be a little broken :P

Overall I think I am fine. I got regular problems for the most part. I don't drink and don't need any therapy. I've built myself up, and I think the one that was most damaged was my mum. ",0

My dad has some kind of unknown disease that makes him stop taking up nutrients for some reason, he has spent the last 15 years trying to figure out what it is, and doctors are dumbfounded each time. At least they found a shot that alleviates the symptoms, but the problem is that the shot is supposed to work for something altogether different and previously ruled out (and ruled out again, and again).

The shot costs 15k NOK every 3 months, so I'm happy I live in Norway, so the shot only costs us about 5k NOK every year.",0

It's nice coming to terms early And my family doctor is definitely helping to keep an eye to see if this is a family/hereditary trait.

She's a very fragile and insanely emotional girl, I am basically a stump that can talk. Things work between us for the most part, but she is super clingy and I like to have my own time and do things with friends from time to time. The way she has demanded attention constantly has stopped me from talking to my friends much at all in the last year or so. 

My friend just rented a house in Cape Cod for vacation and invited me to come along for free. I told her that I'm definitely going. I have not told my SO yet because this same situation happened last year and my friend accidentally brought it up at a party they invited us to and my girlfriend didn't know yet because I hadn't told her. She freaked out because I was planning something behind her back and we almost broke up over it. 

She has severe anxiety and depression. Also a heart condition where her heart gives out under high stress. She has had a few heart attacks because of panic attacks already. I had to learn CPR for her because she's so overly emotional and unstable that these situations come up regularly.

I need a fucking vacation. I have done nothing but work, study, and cater to my girlfriends feelings for a year and a half now and blew my last chance at a vacation.

If not she is either a suicidal moron or simply doesn't have a heart problem (you know that panic attacks can present almost identical to heart attacks right?). 

Edit: if she is being responsible with her health, then you need to tell her that her current level of therapy isn't cutting it and she needs to talk to her psychologist/psychiatrist about treatments aimed at emotional regulation and appropriate responses to emotions. I'd highly recommend cognitive or dialectical behavioral therapy.

I felt an impending sense of sheer doom - for no apparent reason, beyond the fact that my pulse was racing and I felt like I was going to die.  I went to the ER, thinking I was having a heart attack.

The specialist used a more elaborate ekg system I think and same shit happened again so they put me on a table with my shirt off, called in like 10 doctors to stand around and see what was goin on and they gave me an ultra sound over my heart.

I watched my father-in-law lose his eyesight, then the needle like pain shooting through his feet as he started losing those.   
I watched him descend into madness at being alone in the ""dark"". Helped my wife and mother-in-law pick him up off the floor, after a mild heart attack, so when the paramedics arrived they could easily access him. I heard him cry out in pain when a sudden stroke caused him to bite through his tongue. And I was there in the hospital room when the second stroke made him a vegetable.   
He died soon after that, thankfully.

If your number and record keeping is right, it doesn't matter what someone says you *should* be able to eat, just what you know you actually *can* eat.

(2) How are you sleeping? My experience is actually on the other end, a low weight person who has trouble eating and has to focus on weight maintenance from the other side of the coin. Sleep is really key, for me, for burning fat. When I'm going through a period when I can't eat and have to burn fat stores, I don't do that well at all if I don't sleep.

So, two eggs in the morning, at least every other day, won't really hurt you in that department. In fact, dietary cholesterol is critical for production of hormones, such as testosterone.

Your blood cholesterol levels are affected by your consumption of fats. Keep your intake of sat fats down and focus on consuming a good amount of soluble fiber in order to keep your cholesterol levels under control.

And on the topic of fiber, I don't know how much you already consume on average, but more soluble and insoluble fiber probably won't hurt. It is another tool to help keep you feeling full, and is critical in the digestion process. So, don't shy away from those vegetables and oats.

"Different doctors will have different MOs. This is likely a matter of just incompatibility between doctor and patient rather than an issue with you seeing a family practitioner (I’m referring moreso to the comment saying you need to find a male internist instead of family practice, that’s not necessary.)


My family doctor is pretty withholding when it comes to tests, she asks me all the standard questions at my yearly physical (do you smoke, how much do you drink, are you exercising, any muscle/skin/pain complaints, etc.) but when it comes to specific stuff I need to be the one to bring it up or ask for a specific test; afterall she only sees me once a year, I know my body better than she does even if she’s more trained on bodies in general. She adheres to the idea that, if I needed something I would talk about it, because she can’t read my mind. If you’re concerned about STD test results then you need to bring it up yourself (are you referring to most resent results? Because if they’re clear there’s no reason for her to bring it up.) Do you have a family history of high cholesterol? There’s not likely to be a reason to Test it if you’re otherwise young and symptom free. My Doctor would ask me if I’m sexually active, but I would be the one to ask for STD testing. Perhaps she would have offered it if I didn’t ask, who knows. 


Now as a nurse I work in a hospital with many different doctors, some are gung ho about ordering every test and taking on every case. Other doctors are much more realistic and cost effective when it comes to limiting unnecessary interventions. Both of them are right in their own way. So with your doctor you can either get more comfortable speaking up (as I had to do with my family doc) or seek out a different doctor who may have a different personality. ",0
"A lot of, if not most, doctors are not going to order tests unless there is a reason to do so (ie: you have a symptom or a family history of symptoms.) Your stable healthy vital signs and lack of complaints of symptoms would indicate you don’t need investigation into other testing. 



If you’d like to have cholesterol tested otherwise then you should ask her. You can ask for a standard blood testing panel (things like complete blood cell count, electrolytes) as a baseline if you like. If you have a health diet, you are young and are symptom free with no family history of high cholesterol, then there is zero reason why your family doctor would offer a cholesterol test without prompting from you.

"As someone who works in health care: My confidence in my own GP is like... 7/10. She's kind of apathetic but seems to know her stuff for the most part. I feel like she should take my migraines more seriously, and a few years back when I developed white spots all over my skin she was convinced I had vitiligo. Even after I found a very common fungal skin infection and said ""This is what it is, this is the drug I need"" she wrote me a script but said ""I still think it's vitiligo."" Guess what? The spots went away. 

GPs are good resources to get referrals and deal with minor complaints. They're also a good way to build a medical history to have passed on to hospitals when you do get sick. 

However I find that some people place way too much confidence in their GP. They're still human, they aren't infallible or a robotic encyclopedia. I've had too many people say ""Well my doctor told me [totally incorrect thing here]"" and oftentimes that totally incorrect thing is a common misconception or based on old medical assumptions that were debunked 20 years ago. Some doctors are stubborn, some just don't know current info on every medical problem ever, some have biases...  so people should always be down for a second opinion. ",0
"My mother is a GP.

She believes in homeopathy.

She still believes that saturated fat causes heart disease.

When I was a child, she would give me antibiotics for basically anything that didn't go away on its own quickly enough. She would also give me sleeping pills every time I had any difficulty sleeping (which, as I can tell now, was caused solely by spending too much time in front of the screen before bed and oversleeping in the morning), to the point that a few times I actually started hallucinating because she'd give me an adult dosage, or even a double dosage.

She freaks out every time I lift something heavier than 4kg because ""It's going to make your uterus fall out.""

When I once had a bout of anxiety so severe that I couldn't swallow a single bite of food for 4 days, she told me I was just imagining things.

She's significantly overweight, doesn't exercise, doesn't take care of her health in any way (but is lucky to be quite healthy, good genes from grandparents).

I actually *taught* her what PubMed is, she had no idea it even existed, but even if she did it would be of little use of her because she doesn't speak English (I'm from a non-English speaking country). When I asked her how she keeps up with the most recent research in order to modify her treatments respectively, she tells me she attends conferences. When I probe further, it turns out those conferences are 5% about medicine research and 95% about pharmaceutical companies advertising their new drugs.

And the worst part is, she's not an exception, at least where I live. I've been to the clinic she works at multiple times. I've never seen a single doctor under 40 with healthy weight. Her best friends are also doctors, we often meet. Here's a legit conversation between them the last time we all met during winter holiday, when at one point the topic turned to the effect of dietary cholesterol on heart disease and the efficacy of statins on blood pressure and cardiovascular health. One of the group, a cardiologist, was claiming that statins are, for the most part, bullshit because not only they have so many side effects, their efficacy is very questionable at best, because high cholesterol doesn't actually cause heart disease on its own, inflammation is usually the underlying cause, and artificially lowering cholesterol levels does nothing for health. All the other doctors, mostly GPs, including my mother, were arguing with him, but in the end he ""won"" because he actually knew his shit and could support his statements. Afterwards:

Doctor nr 2: ""You know, I really feel like I don't understand anything about cholesterol anymore.""

Doctor nr 3: ""Yeah, so are statins really bad, then? But what should we be telling the patients instead?""

Doctor nr 4: ""I don't know, I just keep giving statins because that's the standard procedure.""

Doctor nr 3: ""Yeah, same here. And if you don't give the patients anything, they get angry and complain to the administration, so it's just not worth the hassle trying to argue.""

I was just sitting there and thinking: ""... so these are the people whose hands we put our health into.""

Since I came to the UK to study, I've been to two other GPs  for an autoimmune skin condition that I have, and the experience was equally as preposterous. The first time, I told him that my current medication was thinning my skin so I wanted something else. He told me that I would have to wait six months to see a dermatologist (fuck NHS...), but he could write me a prescription for a different, non-corticosteroid medication, I agreed. He wrote the prescription. It turned out to be *exactly the same fucking corticosteroid I've been taking*, except with a slightly different ratio. I changed GPs and went to another one, he finally wrote me a prescription I needed... after googling for several minutes. But the thing is, both times the whole appointment took like 5 minutes. They asked no questions about me or my disease. I could have bought the damn prescription for myself if I was allowed to.

I've never been to a GP since then (for 2 years). Thankfully I'm in great health (aside from that one), and if I really need something, like a NSAID, I can just get it without prescription in a pharmacy or even grocery store. As far as I'm concerned, the only thing GPs are good for is being a link to the actual doctors specialising in something you need at that time; or maybe general things like regular blood tests. But far too often they seem to have no idea what they're doing. This whole system is rotten.",0
"If I listened to GP doctors, I'd be dead. 

Every single one of them missed and/or ignored that I had pretty much every textbook symptom of hypothyroidism starting around age 11. 

>You're too young for thyroid issues, you just need to eat less. 

It didn't matter that my mother AND her father had Graves.

It took until I was 25 before I found an endocrinologist who saw my numbers and was basically like ""WTF, why have you not been treated yet?"" 

My thyroid is now essentially fully failed. (For those familiar with dosages, I'm on 200mcg T4, and 10mcg T3 (5mcg twice daily)).

Remaining untreated, I'd be in heart failure for sure and likely dead by now. It's actually surprising there wasn't heart damage from how long I was severely hypo. 

Basically my trust in GP doctors is non-existent. Now they're for yearly physicals and to bully into getting whatever diagnostic test I need done for whatever.    ",0
"I don't care for my current one and am looking for a new one. The current one is an alarmist, ordering multiple tests for very insignificant findings, or things that we've already discussed. For example, I have high cholesterol which has a side effect of elevated liver function. When my bloodwork showed all of that, that's exactly what they told me. They also said ""but we're going to test you for hepatitis, just in case."" I told them that I had been vaccinated against hepatitis and had zero other symptoms of hepatitis. They refused to continue any treatment or to write any prescriptions until I took a hep screening. A waste of time and money.

Additionally, their office seems to change RNs every single year, so when I go in for a check up it's someone new every time. And then like clockwork, the new RN sounds the alarm over my cholesterol. I tell them that I've already discussed it with the doctor and their predecessor multiple times, and that unless they have any new info then I won't be coming in for a follow up consultation. The RNs flip their shit about being told no, and threaten to withhold my cholesterol medication.",0

The structural stability it adds to your shit also traps bile into your shit, instead of allowing your body to re-absorb and recycle the bile as it travels through your small intestine. This means your bile is eliminated into the toilet. Therefore your body has to make fresh new bile; a main ingredient of bile is cholesterol. Your body will filter the blood for usable cholesterol and with a diet of regular fiber your blood serum levels of cholesterol will go down. Have a nice filling oatmeal breakfast, eat a bacon cheese burger for dinner, don't worry about your arteries. ",0
"My exercise schedule is not as consistent as what you are describing. I walk 20 minutes each way to/from work (by parking further from the office). On days with biking it's usually 30 minutes. Swimming is 1 or 2 days a week for 45 minutes. Resistance/weights is generally just 20 pushups in the morning, and another 20 at night (this has been helping, my pushup numbers have been steadily improving). Sometimes after a hard bike or swimming workout I'll be exhausted for a while. Moderate exercise seems to be best, at least when translated into more energy.",0

He had no wife, no children, no legacy and would often come to our apartment to live and eat. My parents of course took care of him but the last time he come and sleep in our home was when he had a stroke. It was a ""grow up"" moment for me because he sitted in a small desk where I used to do my homework when my parent realized he had a stroke and tried to call the ambulance. He also slept in my old room where he forgot to close the window during sleep which result in his stroke. It was these details that I realize how vulnerable human life are.

Also there's apparently special makeup that can completely cover up tattoos so my acne won't be a problem.

"Yeah good observation - would it be fair to say that it is probably easier to tell a kid that no one can pull off Rambo levels of devastation vs telling a kid that porn doesn't reflect sex as a wider thing, and visa versa, it's easier for a kid to ask a question about rambo than it is about porn? 

It's a genuine question - i was raised by my mom and porn was a dirty word and act growing up, I remember having a heart attack when she wanted to search something and wrote www.p.. learned to clear my history after that and so it was this very secretive thing I did. Father abandonment is one of the biggest issues effecting young men of particularly Gen Y/Gen X in Western society, so I can see how it it could be a wider issue that potentially porn is replacing what fathers could be teaching but I don't want to assume - I also don't want to demonise porn necessarily.

"We started out as roommates in Uni a little over 2 years ago. Both of us got the wrong impression of each other initially. He thought I was a stuck up bitch, since I was friends with someone that was one. I thought he was socially awkward and couldn't tolerate me for no reason. However, we got to know each other more. I invited him to come home with me for thanksgiving for the week, since he had no where to go (he was an international student). I think that was when I caught some feelings without actually knowing it (or at least accept it). However, I didn't want to act on it since I was in a relationship at the time (but by that point, it was falling apart for other reasons not related to the roommate). I told myself that we'd be better friends. Time passes, and we strengthen our friendship. I eventually broke from that previous relationship because of the emotional abuse and strain in my academics that the ex was causing. Roommate helped me through the emotional stress. Got even closer to that roommate in terms of friendship. One night, he invited me into his room after watching a movie, since there was a party going on in our apartment by our other roommates that we didn't want to be a part of. It got late, and he let me sleep in his bed since neither of us wanted to go out. He initiates things by cuddling me, and then tickling me since he couldn't sleep. We ended up kissing, then having sex. That took me over the edge with him. 

We ended up moving across the country after graduating, since he got a job offer and I wanted to be with him. I agreed to move, since I was able to transfer my job and since I'm studying for med school. We just celebrated a year going strong. I love him more than anything, and can see myself marrying him.",0

"It was gradual. Once we lived together, we started developing deeper feelings for each other. We never defined the relationship or put any aspect of the relationship into words. It's all based on emotions. All relationships are like this, you can't identify specific instances or events that allows you to level up to the next stage. Life doesn't work like that. Certain things will improve or worsen relationships, but they should be treated as one-offs when considering the health of your relationship. You don't look at individual events, you look at everything.

Say currently you guys aren't on good terms, you can evaluate the situation 2 ways. One is to look at the present and disregard the past. You guys feel in love but the passion dissipated, so it's time to move on. Another way is to look at your entire history. You spent a lot of time together, maybe taking care of your memories and the emotions associated with those memories is more important than your immediate satisfaction in life right now. Or maybe you don't have much of a memory to begin with, which makes it a bit easier when making decisions.",0
"I’ll answer for my boyfriend. 
We were fuck buddies for the whole summer. We verbally agreed to be friends with benefits, but under two conditions. We stay friends first and we stay monogamous (we weren’t have sex with a condom at the time I know I know) 

We would mess around like bunnies every other day after a stressful day at school. I really liked him but I never thought a guy like him would like a girl like me other than for my body. (Which I was okay with!). 

Exactly one year ago my brother unexpectedly passed away. I got the phone call while I was with him. He didn’t know what to say but he just held me super tight until my friend came to pick me up. 

Soon after I noticed his behavior changing. He was much sweet. Offering to cook me meals. Cuddling with me longer. Asking me how I was doing. 

And then he asked me to be his girlfriend. I was super shocked. I noticed a change in behavior but I thought he was just being nicer. I unfortunately told him no because I wasn’t ready. We continued messing around and one drunken night he told me he noticed he really liked me because he saw how much pain I was in with the death of my brother and wanted to help me not feel that pain anymore. 

And that was the sweetest fucking thing any guy has ever said to me. 

I was finally ready to commit to a relatnship but by then he moved on and ended our FWB. (I learned that me rejecting him really hurt him) 

We later reconnected over the summer and now awe re fully boyfriend and girlfriend (FINALLY)",0
We were at a party drinking and hanging out in the couch talking to each other because we both don't like parties. Next thing we know it's about 4am and we're still hanging out on that same couch talking with each other. We eventually passed out leaning up against one another.,0
"I met my now girlfriend of two years in middle school, and knew almost immediately. She didn't have feelings for me then, but we were still great friends all throughout school, and a little past graduation before she decided to give me a try. We passed our two year anniversary in october and currently live together.",0
"My ex was my first serious relationship and was one of my best friends years before we started dating. There was always some tension, but we never wanted to have it affect our relationship or friend group. 

After a couple years we were no longer flirty and the sexual tension was non existent. One day, after a friend group event, while walking her to her car she grabs me and kisses me and I feel these butterflies rush into my stomach. It was awesome.

We dated for 3 years and I honestly thought she was the one. Best relationship ever! She helped me grow as a person and feel like I owe her for where I am in life now. 

Unfortunately we broke up earlier this summer and it was for the best. Though we made a great team and loved each other deeply we just weren't clicking. Sex was non-existent and it felt like we treated each other like siblings and not a romantic couple. We both had things we could have done better. Sometimes I wonder if I just didn't try hard enough but I've also realized I just wasn't happy and fell out of love... maybe she did too. The last time we had sex it felt mechanical and I felt nothing emotionally like I had before. That's when I knew we we're done.

Now I'm single and have had time to reflect on the flaws we each had and how the relationship broke down over time. I have somethings I need to work on not just for my next partner, but for my own happiness and personal growth. I've been enjoying being single and focusing on working on myself (gym, hobbies, self reflection, career). We haven't spoken since the break up but I wish her nothing, but happiness and if given the choice to go back in time and give it another go I would.",0
"This beautiful, smart, hilarious woman was transferred to my Resturant a long time ago when my then boss quit.
She was an amazing boss, the best I’ve had to date in fact. She was married at the time but not an issue because I was getting out of a terrible relationship (that ex was on tv cause she got pulled over and the police found homemade bombs in the trunk that they blew up on tv).
We worked closely together and became instant buds cause we both have a terrible sense of humor. I was not  anywhere near considering her as more than a friend bc she was married and I am not going to be the one who breaks up a happy marriage.
They divorced a month or two after she came to my store.
Later that winter we started going out for drinks with a group of my friends pretty consistently.
I noticed little changes.
Glances that hung on for an extra moment.
Began noticing when she was physically near.
Our group obviously saw it and on New Year’s Eve we were all supposed to go out and everyone stood us up.

Forced to be alone together and a bit into our cups we had our first of at least a billion kisses.",0
"Yes and no. We knew each other since elementary school. By the time we recognized we had feelings for each other, she was battling brain cancer and I had just had open heart surgery. So we made the worst mistake possible and decided not to act on it. She beat it the first time around after a long battle. Then I left the state for university, it came back and this time it was just too aggressive so she decided to go out on her own terms. She got a nitrogen tank, a breathing mask, and went out on her own terms and with dignity. I couldnt handle it at the time and had a job offer from a family friend to come work for his private military company. It was the perfect excuse to turn my emotions off and focus on work. I'd give anything to have her back.

During high school was when we first realized we had feeling for each other. I cant count the number of times shed call me at 3 or 4 in the morning, sobbing. So I'd get up, drive to her place, and hold her while she cried. Despite the massive medical issues we were both battling at the time, these were the best times of our lives. We were each the only ones in our respective lives that had any comprehension of how hard, and terrifying our medical issues were so we were also the only ones that could really comfort each other. I'd give anything to have her back.",0
Glad that your persistent feelings paid off. Godspeed!,0
"I completely agree with themezz. The best kind of relationship like that is one where you don't realize when the ""status"" switched. It sounds like you're comfortable enough with eachother, you may want to try going out 1 on 1 more, edging towards ""date-like"" things where you can without intentionally changing the relationship.

The risk will always be there though, and it can be scary thinking about what you can lose. But if you both can appreciate each other's presence, that can ease a lot of your worries. And even from the little you said, I'm pretty sure that compassion/care exists.",0
"This happened to me. Except way worse, and way more dramatic.

Had a group of friends. There was 5 of us in total. One caught feelings for me and I felt similarly. We dated for a bit. It didn't work out and things turned sour. We tried to end things amicably and go back to being friends but it didn't work out. He largely disconnected from the group. Now there were four.

Following that, I drowned my sorrows and vented my frustrations with another member of the group. He'd recently gone through a sour relationship too so we bonded over that. He caught feelings. I figured hey, why not, I like this guy, and we went for it. Another member of group also liked this guy, and was upset they were passed over, subsequently leaving the group. Now there were three. Said relationship eventually went sour. We fell out of touch. Now there were two.

I remained friends with this other guy for a while after the fact. Things always remained purely platonic between us and he was the embodiment of logic and reason. Things seemed pretty safe. It was several years after the aforementioned events and I had recently gotten back together with the second guy, only for things to fall apart again and for us to fall out of touch. Shortly after, the last remaining guy expressed interest. Clearly being an idiot and not having learned from all of this, I went for it. Things fell apart shortly after.

And now, there is no friends group.

I'm ashamed of how long it took me to learn that lesson and that I lost far too many friends over it. If I could turn back time, I'd have kept them as friends and nothing more. While each of them came onto me and not the other way around, I should have had the willpower and foresight to turn them down, to know how things would go. I miss having them as friends, but I know the damage is done - I don't wish to reopen old wounds by trying to contact them. Also, I highly doubt my current partner would approve of me contacting exes, and fair enough too - I'd feel the same way.",0
"Plenty of people have wonderful relationships and marriages, even if they weren't friends for years beforehand.

"25 M, been doing this for years.  The [Healthy Strokes](http://www.healthystrokes.com/TMS.pdf) thing linked elsewhere is interesting, but I'm not sure how accurate.  To me it seems a little judgemental, i.e. ""90% of guys do it the standard way so anything else is weird"" kinda thing.

One caveat - I do occasionally vary me auto-erotic M.O., and do it in what I guess is a conventional manner.  But, 90+% of the time, I do it prone.

I have sex fairly often, sometimes several times a week.  I've never had much problem with maintaining an erection (sometimes I do if wearing a condom, but with my girlfriend on BC I don't have to worry about that.)  

Sometimes it takes me a long time to finish, and every once in a blue moon I can't finish.  However, sometimes I finish in an embarrassingly short amount of time.  The vast majority of times I finish in a normal (I guess?) amount of time, usually with my girlfriend climaxing just a bit before, or sometimes I finish her off with my hand after.

The one thing that did (sort of) strike a chord with me is not coming from oral.  I never have.  However, I've never had oral performed on me for very long, i.e. just as foreplay and never as just the main event.  I'm actually not a big fan of it as foreplay as I'll come quicker after.  If it were the main event I think I could come from it.

Now that it's been brought up, I am interested if I need to make the switch.  I don't find the Healthy Strokes thing that convincing.  Does anyone have any info on prOnanism causing any lasting and irreversible damage?",0

"You're right, that link is turrible. It's just his opinion misrepresented as fact. That said, he's mostly right. Humping-style masturbation does use a lot more pressure than masturbating with your hands. It's a lot easier to hurt yourself doing prone masturbation, because the weight of the body makes the momentum behind a stroke capable of really injuring the penis if it moves wrong. Guys can be so into what they're doing they don't even notice the damage until they're done.

"I've responded on here earlier, but this is more detailed. Failure did it for me. 

I'm about to turn 32 in July. Before 2017, I only dated one person in my lifetime and it was for 2 1/2 years. She and I have done sexual things, but we never had intercourse. She had been afraid, and then I became afraid. Lo-and-behold, she broke it off on Christmas Eve 2013.

2017 rolls around, and I began breaking out of my shell, making friends and building a foundation for my life. I convinced myself, somehow, that a relationship was the missing ingredient. Perhaps it was being the butt-end of my friends jokes for ""sexual inexperience"" and ""undersexed"" ... usually these jokes were passed by women friends ... regardless, I had become insecure. I didn't know the extent of my insecurity, but it motivated me to resolve the problem. So, I entered the world of online dating.

I went on 30-something first dates, and none of them ""worked"" and went beyond a 1st date. I didn't know what I had been doing wrong, and I felt they all saw something that I lacked any access to. As failure after failure began occurring, I became bitter and resentful. ""They see something wrong in me,"" you see, ""and I have no idea what it is, but I have this omnipresent feeling of being unlovable."" Indeed, I began expressing to friends that I felt unlovable. 

So, a long time crush of mine enters the picture (and I mean long-time crush). And she agreed to hang out with me and my friends group, but only as friends ... she insisted that she only wanted to be friends. I agreed. She came over. We drank and flirted the entire time. Touching, caressing, hand holding, you name it ... lots of cuddling and physical affection for someone that only desired friendship. So later on, I kissed her. She didn't like it. The last thing I wanted her to feel was threatened, and she was entirely valid in having that concern at this point-in-time. I didn't press any further that night.

I apologized to her soon after this night, and she agreed to hang out with me alone a second night, not two weekends later. I should never have had her over. I never realized just how bad inexperience can shape us out to be. Conversation was good. There was more cuddling. During the wee hours of the morning, 1 AM or so, she brought up sex. She asked me when the last time I had sex was. I said it had a long time ... it was about 3 years since my first ex came over for a ""hook up"" but without intercourse. I remember the look on her face. I kid you not, it looked like contempt. Of course, I may have been projecting that. But I felt something I never felt before ... I froze. I had never frozen up before. She got up from the couch, made it about me (showing her own insecurities, which I overlooked at the time), and quickly paced to the bathroom.

I felt like a shit-ton of bricks hit me. It was a simple rejection, but I had access to something I never had access to. I understood why I was unlovable. It took me many months to understand, but I had an emotional flashback to my stepmom dropping me off at a daycare when I was 5. I never saw nor heard from her again. I never healed from such an experience, and I carried this experience into adulthood. 

Abandonment. My experience had been unlocked. I had been emotionally attuned to my experience as a child. I blamed myself for the experience ever since.

I've been carrying this experience since mid-2017. I've dated two women after this experience, both of whom I've had sex with. I've determined I'm more comfortable not being emotionally open with partners. Sex is not tied to intimacy for me, and I felt neither of them loved me for who I am. 

This was a very painful journey, but I highly recommend anyone undertake it. Why? There's a flip-side to all this.

I learned how to express myself through writing. I became aware of my limitations. And I learned that I had bigger issues than a lack of a relationship. I'm grateful for the entire arrangement, because it pushed me into a spot that I'm not comfortable being within. And it allowed me to discover areas of my life that needed healing and self-parenting, parenting that had been lacking since I had been young.",0
Started dating at 27.  Got some good pictures and got better at chatting on apps. Still had to go on over 40 dates before finding anyone. Consistently worked on my appearance and tried to be more social to be more comfortable in conversation. Finally happened at 28 in January,0
"Find a passion project and pursuit it. Also get on a good weight lifting program and become more athletic, this was the best decision of my life and only wish I started sooner.

"You are right. You can do everything right and still fail. But the chances of it working out are increased by taking an active role. You have taken an active role by seeing a psychologist. It doesn't mean you're cured but it means that you're at least closer toward overcoming your obstacle rather than willingly dwelling in it.

I also believe mindset plays a large role. I'm bipolar and depression and mania are something I have to live with. I don't let it control me because it is something I'm fighting, it's not something that defines me. I've lived an incredible life even though I'm depressed as shit for the majority and have experienced more failure than success. Hell I'm a late bloomer as well and have been rejected way too many times that i've lost count. But I'd rather be doing something than doing nothing. I can see the rejection as proof that I'm a piece of shit that nobody is ever going to love or care about, or I can see it as proof that the person rejecting me isn't the right person for me. That I deserve to find someone who cares about me and wants to be with me regardless of my issues. I can increase the chances of me finding it by taking a more active role. I can put myself out there, work on my issues, and keep trying. If my success rate is 1/1000. Then my odds are better by talking to 1000 girls than only 2 or 3 in my life. 

I've experienced one of the harshest rejections in my life by the person I cared for most in the world. I finally got my shit together and did everything right. Spent years working on myself and becoming the person I wanted to be. She was the first person I was sure about and was willing to be vulnerable with and I knew her for over half my life. She was the person who knew me best in the world and she said she loved me and needed me in her life. Then she ghosted me the next day. A month later she's with a friend of mine. It sucked and for a while I was broken. I had a choice wallow in self-pity or do something with my life. I chose to do something. I didn't want to undo all the years of progress I made. So I did something about it. 

Created a company with my best friends doing what we love, kept myself in check throughout it, and now I'm honestly happy for once. I started working out, caring about my image and bought nicer clothes, better haircuts, generated income for myself, and my confidence in myself went up. Actually I stopped giving a fuck before I even had confidence. The worst had happened and I survived so why not try. I got rejected more, and by more I mean a lot. Now I get dates at a higher rate than before and not all of them are going to work out and that's okay. I'm better now and will be okay. The company hasn't panned out yet. I'm not even sure if it'll succeed but it makes me happy, keeps me busy, and has been a crazy journey that shows that I'm at least no longer passive about my life. I'm grateful for the opportunity to fail and succeed.

I've failed more than I've succeeded but all it takes is for one to work out. So why not keep trying and increasing the odds of meeting that one.",0

"Yeah no. You can go to the YouTube channel warpedperception. He has a gasoline engine with a see through cylinder head. Gasoline engines burn from a point, the sparkplug, and have a travelling flamefront. They burn through the entire powerstroke.

A diesel engine only starts injecting fuel into the cylinder when the fuel is supposed to start burning. Which means that all the fuel ignites immediately and burns at top dead center of the powerstroke

The sooner all the fuel is burnt the more power you get out of the fuel and the more efficient your engine is. Because piston engines work on a pressure differential. 

When all the fuel burns at the start of the stroke the pressure inside the cylinder is higher for longer, because the gas can't get out of the cylinder until you open the exhaust valve, meaning the area under the curve is higher than if you were to burn fuel throughout the whole stroke.

Now for power. A gasoline engine and a diesel engine might have the same torque. But the gasoline engine has the torque at 5000rpm and the diesel at a much more economical, more efficient, 2000rpm.",0
"Torwue depends solely on how long your stroke is and how much displacement the engine has.

Lots of stroke means lots of torque at the low end of the RPM range but the engine doesn't rev fast or high.

Lots of bore and very little stroke means the engine has fuck all torque but revs really high which gives you lots of power.",0
"You don't want the fuel to burn through the entire stroke. You want it to all burn at TDC. Because if it all burns at TDC you get a higher pressure which means more area under the curve and therefore more power and efficiency.

If you go to the YouTube channel warpedperception you can see a gasoline engine with a see through cylinder head. The gas engine burns through the entire stroke because it starts burning a A/F mixture from a single point. A diesel engine only contains air until it starts injecting fuel right when the fuel is supposed to start burning. This means that in a diesel all the fuel burns immediately and way faster than in a gasoline engine.

There's also nothing stopping you from building a gasoline engine with a really small bore and a huge stroke. It just won't rev very high.",0
"[Bullshit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Cutaway_of_a_MAN_V8_Diesel_engine.jpg). The thing between the valves is the diesel injector. And that's a MAN V8 diesel engine.

Every modern diesel engine has [common rail injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_rail) (Every diesel engine that has ever existed was injected. Either directly into the cylinder or into a prechamber.) That's why it needs a high pressure fuel pump. Because it injects the diesel right when it wants it to start burning and because diesel needs to be very finely atomized, a state which it really, really doesn't like being in, which is also why carbureted diesel engines aren't and have never been a thing. And the higher the pressure the smaller you can make the hole in the injector whilst still flowing the same amount of fuel but getting way better atomization and therefore a cleaner and faster burn.

 It injects the fuel  at 1'500-36'000psi (100-2500 bar) by the way.

Oh and if the fuel was in the cylinder during the compression stroke it wouldn't start burning at TDC. It would start burning about halfway up which would kill your engine very very quickly.",0

"I recently lost my dad.

We'd been expecting it for a long time, he was in poor health most of my life and had a stroke a few months ago. I wasn't ready to lose him, but I knew it could happen pretty much at any time, and he was suffering immensely. It was a stressful weight to carry for the whole family. In some ways I had been grieving before he actually died, especially during close calls. Little heart attacks and strokes happened from time to time.

I haven't really dealt with it yet. Not fully anyway, maybe not for years.

I will say that he went during a healthy point in our relationship. There was no unresolved tension, I was living with them and helping them at the time. He went peacefully too. He was a hard man to love, but I let go of my grudges when I saw his body and tried to find his pulse and breathing. Love is more powerful than resentment, and he was out of suffering. For all of that, I am grateful, despite the pain of losing him.

I did some funeral rights the night he died, I anointed him with oil and ashes and smudged the air, left him with coins and my key. Later, I went to a holy place in the mountains and prayed, left a tabacco offering. I know in my heart that he's at peace.

It's hard that I can't touch him, or share stories anymore. It's hard that I can't call him and tell a joke, or show him antlers or rocks I've found. I can't ask him for advice. But, I know that the best parts of him are the best parts of me, and that he isn't suffering anymore.

I don't know if there is coping. Just seeking peace.",0

"Well you already pass the how to not catch feelings phase so either try to ""get him"" or respect your relationship the way it is, is my advice to you. If you treat him like he is your boyfriend when you both know he is not then thats going to become miserable for both of you very quick",0
"Your feelings are *always* valid. Whether or not the immediate trigger concern is the issue or it's something else is just a matter of constructively critical examination.  Emotional logic uses experience and association, working through chemicals and electricity instead of language, but it does have logic to the process. It's not always clear, sometimes it takes shortcuts, sometimes it creates grooves that are hard to escape, sometimes the connection between causes, effects, and correlations aren't obvious... but that's just a matter of practice.

And yes, sometimes the chemicals go a little haywire on their own, for no external reason. Mental health issues suck and being made of meat sucks, but that's a slightly different topic. Sometimes no good answer is apparent after careful examination, but usually that just means you can't see it from your perspective yet. It could be a collection of smaller things that piled up (like a lack of water, food, or vitamin D). Sometimes it *is* nothing at all, but... usually not.

You've every right to have complex feelings and views on a topic. That's normal. You have every right to be upset, as long as you understand why you're upset.  Ideally, you can communicate those feelings accurately and are can respond proportionally\*.\*  Passion does not invalidate your reasoning, but it may require more succinct language.

Let's take a look at idea of ""red flags"" and compare it to the technical term ""[thin slicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-slicing).""  Your subconscious recognized a pattern (I'm guessing this incident is similar to past trauma), sends you a ""gut feeling"" alarm, which translates into anxiety, sadness, depression, etc., and encourages action of some kind (adrenaline response, ""fight flight or freeze"", repeating previous trauma feelz, whatever).  You've recognized the problems at that level, and the conscious part of your brain is attempting to make sense of those alarm bells, but they're loud and fussy and make it hard to think.

**That is normal. Your response is absolutely normal.**

*What you do about that* is the more important question.  What do you want to do? What do you need *to see* to feel safe and have your needs met? Can you get those things from \[This Guy\]? Can you talk to him about it? If you cannot communicate your needs or have them met in a satisfactory manner, well... your time together is over. That sucks. Mourn the loss of what it should have been, but do not *lower* yourself for someone who won't show you the same respect or effort.  Don't chase.

You deserve kindness, trust, love, safety, stability and respect. Everyone does. You deserve those from yourself to yourself, and you deserve those from whomever you're spending time with, regardless of the label on that relationship or the goals you share.

That can be really fucking hard, especially when you're dealing with past traumas, but it's a learned skill just like everything else.

You can do it.

Consider this article about [Tolerance vs Reciprocity](https://aeon.co/essays/reciprocity-not-tolerance-is-the-basis-of-healthy-societies).  TLDR: tolerance isn't enough. That *reciprocity* is now your standard for relationships, because *everyone does* and you are not exempt.",0

Even before the stroke we never really could do much because he had a bad back. They were also old and out of energy. They were just kinda done being parents by the time I came along. 

I also couldn’t talk to him or my mom about problems I had. They grew up in the 60s and the world was so different and they didn’t understand that being a kid in the 00’s wasn’t the same as their childhood. 

I was an accident, but if you have a choice, I don’t recommend having kids when you are old. You just can’t really be there for them the way you should. And you may become a serious burden on their life depending how long you live.

"Currently trying to build an electronically driven fuel injection for a 2 stroke engine. 
Its really hard, so I already gave up on direct injection and variable valve timing.
",0
"Yes this is correct, they absolutely do. The key is that they dont release a fixed amount of fuel, and they do it at différent time depending on the amount of fuel the release. They also do it a bit sooner or a bit later. They also control the ignition timing, which can also happen in advance or later. 

Am doing it on a 2 stroke because I dont have a small 4 stroke available to dabble on, but the basics are the same.

For example, if you are idling and the engine is cold, you ignite a bit in advance from the cycle, because it will take a relatively long time to ignite.
If you open full throtlle, the amount of fuel you want to release is greater, but also depends at which speed the engine is rotating. 
If you are moving fast, the relative wind will input a lot of air in the engine, so you can input more fuel to burn with it.
If the engine is rotating very fast, the air/fuel will be very agitated, very well mixed, so you ignite a bit later, because it will burn very fast. 
The injector itself inputs fuel at a fixed rate, so if you want to input more, you need to start earlier.

All in all, what I described is a multidimentionnal (heat, throttle, air flow, rpm, Lambda sensor) engine cartography. A carburetor does basically the same thing, but mecanically and only bi dimensionnaly, (throttle and rpm)

As for why .. well, because I thought it was really cool, also engines are interesting and wanted to learn all I could about them, but mainly because its the main key to every advanced ""electronic feature"" that engine dealer provide (traction control, etc) without providing any information or control to whoever they sell it. So if you buy a car, an rc plane, a grass cutter, (pretty much any fuel engine in fact), they dont grant customer full control over it, and your mechanic/repairman cant do much more than change the whole damn thing.
So if there was a free project, anyone could strip the ECU box from their cars/bike/stuff and put their own as a replacement for the original one that cost a fortune and does not let you tune your engine they way you want (yes some hacked firmware exist, but they barely scratch the surface of what can be done)

tldr : The inputs are [heat, throttle, air flow, rpm, Lambda sensor], outputs are [injection timing, ignition timing]. And I dream of killing the fuckery that is engine electronics and ECU from big constructors, I doubt i'll succeed, but am learning a ton of stuff, ",0

She mostly recovered from the stroke physically, but the aphasia some blind spots kept her from driving and doing the hobbies she loved.  

In the 8.5 years between her stroke and death, she descended into dementia.  Her descent rapidly accelerated after the death of my father in 2014.

Stay disciplined, learn to be mindful of your thoughts, Count to ten when you start to feel bad. Think of yourself as a mountain and your thoughts and feelings as clouds that pass you by.

"Oh boy,i first studied Systems engineering at the university, but i really didnt liked it, i mean, in some time of my life y loved programming and making software, and the possibility of making videogames (this was my dream) was very present, but somehow the dream was just...fading out. 2 Years later i was sick of all that shit, and i hated it all, my grades where lower and lower, i was very unhappy and lived in constant depression. And then i started with some music lessons, and as months passed by i just realized that my life will be better if i just played my guitar for living, wouldn't be awesome if i could just play my instrument all the time? The dream was huge and i had to work so hard to make it. My guitar teacher was a huge example, and he supported me even when my mom was just not sure for my future.

I went to college and followed my passion. Computer engineering. 62 now was the best decision ever.,0
"You learn to measure success in other ways than work. I'm in my early 60's and never had any real guidance in life with regards to career or work, from school, teachers or even a moment of inspiration. I was never afraid of hard work but I completely wasted my 20's in dead-end service jobs with absolutely no future. I have no passions and even today no real moment of clarity of where I really belong in this world. But I'm alive. That's all I've got.",0
"The thing is, only 1% of people can be the ""winners"", career-wise. The problem is that being a ""winner"" is what your goal is.

What exactly have you gained if you're earning a lot of money? Will a Ferrari make you happy? What happens if you have the Ferrari for a while? It won't be the same as when you just got it. Now a yacht will make you happy? And so on. Is it the approval/admiration of your peers? That is fickle anyway, most don't even care about you. And they will not start caring because you're ""successful"" except for their own gains.

So is having a ""winner"" career really winning? Or is it just a misdirection for 99% of the population?

You say, you have no friends because you have a caustic personality. I don't know what that means, but have you tried changing yourself? Your personality is not set in stone, you can have whatever personality you want to have.

What does ""failure at life in general"" even mean? As far as I know, there is no win condition in life. Biological life's only goal is to not die and pass on your genes, which you've done perfectly so far. So in that sense, you're an absolute success. You only feel like a failure because you believe in some made-up definition of ""success"". Just because most people think that having lots of money is ""winning at life"", doesn't make it true. At one point, most people believed owning many slaves was winning at life. Was it right because most people thought that?

What I'm trying to tell you is: you can't be a failure at life. Life is life and you won already no matter which way you live it. Now you just have to figure out how to live it happily, right now. What can you do right now that makes you happy? And not instant-gratification happy, like coke& bitches. What have you always wanted to do but haven't because you were so focused on your career? Spend more time with your daughter? Hang out with friends (I know what you said, you'd have to find new ones, which is possible)? Build a table? Do it now.

It's never too late to change your approach and become happy. Missed achievements only mean something because you give them meaning. You can't succeed at everything you do, noone can. It's part of life. Accept how your life went so far and move on, to something new.",0
"I think my similar line of thinking is how I've dealt with the passing of my parents in my mid-twenties, back in 2006 and 2008. Devastated isn't a strong enough word. 22 months apart, I could have collapsed into a blackhole of self pity. I imagined other young adults & kids who lost thier parents at a young age or under worse circumstances. I was certainly not alone and I became grateful for the great parents I had. 13 years later, I am a better parent and person for having gone through that experience so young.",0
"I’ve had some pretty rough emotional times in the last 10 years.

"I think about this frequently. I am ambitious. I am also a very ""unique"" individual and have never fit in anywhere. But many people tell me I am VERY intelligent and well-educated for my age. I am, however, a terrible conventional student, and have struggled with everything from passing high school classes and flunking college, to making and sustaining relationships. I often feel very alone and depressed and like I am missing out. But sometimes I see a glimmer, maybe in a test I take, or a conversation I have, or when it is 3 am and I am reading a textbook for a class I am not even taking, but on something i am deeply interested in personally. I think ""wow, I am really odd duck...but maybe I should value my eccentricities and perhaps something will come of this. If I had an ideal life, and lots of friends, and were a good typical student, there is no way I would know/care about the things I love to know/care about, which most people don't seem to know/care about"". Life is a strange strange thing.",0
"You should. I fought going to therapy for years and I had the good fortune to have friends who convinced me. I have a brother who was in the same funk I was, who did not go to therapy. As the years have passed, my life has gotten on a great track, and he is still mired in the issues that plagued us as kids. Therapy taught me to see the world in a new way, the way that other people see it. It was the second-best decision I ever made (only second to getting a dog, and what's going to beat that?).",0
"There are more teachers than CEOs, and in general they do more good for the world. 

Recall, A rich man can no more get into heaven, then a camel can pass through the eye of a needle. Even if you don't take heaven literally, your mental health will often be affected if you pursue a line of work that hurts others in pursuit of profit. 

Unless you're a psychopath.",0
"As someone who has encouraged and taken others to seek help, do so as soon as you can. There is no use waiting for ""the right time"" or anything like that. You should just start making calls to recommended professionals near you and make an appointment. The absolute worst-case scenario is that you don't like the therapist you see. This is normal, people are complicated and no therapist is a guaranteed fit for you. Just try the next one until you are happy with your experience.

I promise you, just the fact that you are seeking help will in itself help. Taking control of the demons in your life gives you power, authority even. Seeking help will give you the tools you need to make deliberate decisions about the kind of person you are so you don't feel like a passenger in a stalling plane. Nothing bad can come from it and every day spent waiting is one less day you could have been making progress.",0
"Yeah, that can definitely make a difference. The most important thing is that you can be consistent about it. 

I've run into some therapists in my area that don't charge for the first appointment as well, so you may ask about that when they get in touch.

It's really cool that you are being so proactive about getting help. I know it probably doesn't feel like much to you, but it's a really big step, and you should be proud of yourself for taking it.",0
"Thats because having your heart broke is literally that. 

Broken heart syndrome is a temporary heart condition that's often brought on by stressful situations, such as the death of a loved one. The condition can also be triggered by a serious physical illness or surgery. People with broken heart syndrome may have sudden chest pain or think they're having a heart attack.
In broken heart syndrome, there's a temporary disruption of your heart's normal pumping function in one area of the heart. The remainder of the heart functions normally or with even more forceful contractions. Broken heart syndrome may be caused by the heart's reaction to a surge of stress hormones.

The condition may also be called takotsubo cardiomyopathy, apical ballooning syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy by doctors. The symptoms of broken heart syndrome are treatable, and the condition usually reverses itself in days or weeks.

"My ex once told me (early on when we were dating, as if it’s foreshadowing) about what she thought of exes as we were bringing up our history of dating. She said: “Exes are people who knew us best...and though moved on, would always be people we carry in our hearts, even if it gets depressing”

It may hurt a life time, but I think of what she said every time I feel like blowing my head off. You can’t get rid of the pain, you carry with it for life. 

And so I just embraced to have heartbreak for a lifetime. Once you do that, your breakdowns no longer feel hopeless; it’s just another wave of things passing by in life. And eventually better things come and go again.

Hope this helps with the anxiety for future pains...

"TLDR I broke up with my girlfriend and now I feel like an empty soda can just waiting to get run over by a car


Im in my early 20’s, I broke up with my last 2 girlfriends, the first one wasn’t nearly as bad as the second. I spent nearly a year of my life with this girl (which may seem short to others, but was the longest I’ve had to record) it was a slow crash, that’s what I remember it feeling like. After months of learning everything about eachother we fell into a routine. Day after day we did the same thing, day after day I felt myself slowly losing interest in her. She was a sweet girl, artistic, didn’t like to argue, she put me on a pedestal. She loved me more than anyone she’d ever been with, but I didn’t, at least not at the time. I got to a point where I just didn’t know what I wanted, I looked at this girl like a jigsaw puzzle, it seemed to me that I had found and put all the pieces together and now it was time for me to let go. So I did. I remember that night so clearly. It was late, she was sitting on the curb crying her eyes out while I watched her a trickle of guilt sprang in my mental pipework. Soon that trickle grew into something else entirely over the passing days, weeks, and months... all the way to now. It’s been long over a year and I see myself in the mirror every afternoon evening or night... depending on how late I sleep missing her.. maybe not her specifically but I’m missing that connection that I had with her. 

To this day I half heartedly swipe around tinder, looking for someone who will give me any amount of attention but I have yet to find a single soul that can even compare to my old love.

"When I was younger, I never really had the framework to deal with heartache/heart break. It took a lot of different relationships, with a lot of different people before I found how to cope effectively. I dont consider myself an expert, but my recovery time is mitigated significantly from what it would have been 15 years ago. 

If I had the oportunity to help my younger self, this is what I would say:

**The pain you are feeling is from a lack of understanding of your current emotional state. You need to be patient and explore your feelings. Look for the root of where they are coming from. You are a good person, and you have noble goals. Instead of changing yourself for others benefit, consider embracing your passions. Worry less about what others think about you and more about who you are. Establish a person that can exsist outside of a relationship instead of being a person reliant on one.**",0
"Each time when my exes had broken up with me, it didn't had any kind of emotion to me, maybe because I didn't have any interest after all, I don't know.

When my grandad died in 2012, I cried like a little baby (was in my mid-20s) a'd swore to myself I would 'ever cry again, it made my heart so much, besides I was alone, I'm a very lone person. I don't really share my emotions, I always live like that (strict education by my father).

A few years passes, I think I'm strong, that nothing can hurt me, I would think I'd developped a kind of shield around me to protect me.

How wrong I was, last year my best friend, SO, crush, for 10 years broke up with me, I fell in tears like never I cried before. That's when I realized that no matter hiw strong you think you are, that you think you can manage your emotions, when your heart is hurt, when your heart is broken, it always touches you deep and strong, you feel empty, like something was missing. And again I was alone, because I'm a lone cowboy.",0
I think the heartbreak is the hardest part when it's a short lasted relationship. A relationship with love and considerable life sharing leaves a scar much worse than the initial chest pain.,0
"I feel that. When I broke up with my ex it sucked so bad to not share things with him anymore but I coped because I knew we would eventually be able to be friends and our language would still exist, just in a different capacity.

"That's funny, my break up had the exact opposite effect. My grades have always been mediocre, but as soon as I broke up I got straight A's and started more consistently working out in an attempt to gain a lot of confidence that I lost. The year following the breakup, I had advanced my life much farther than I had in probably the 5 years I had been in the relationship, so it was actually a catalyst for very positive change in my life. It was like someone lit a fire under my ass, but I had to experience a really heavy emotional experience first. I had always had minimum wage gigs, but I trained for a competitive position for a year and now I'm getting paid more than twice as much. I'm really prioritizing finishing school now, so I'm hesitant to get back into a relationship. It's a double edged sword though because I hardly feel satisfied with any accomplishment for very long. I look at my peers who have already finished school and think, ""I can't bask in this yet, I'm not even close to the person I want to be."" I recognize this as potentially unhealthy, but I'm afraid to let go of this discontentment (almost a self-loathing, but I suppose channeled in a way the brings about positive change).

"Ahh, as in, you disapprove of their lifestyle choices. So when they imply that your disapproval is related to a fear of them, that they are taking a ""cop-out"", rather than to acknowledge that you disagree with that person at a fundamental level. 

It's really all about motivations. Anti and Pro LGBTQ tend to attack dissenters. For instance, the LGBTQ attack on drag queens/cross-dressing men, exclusionary attitudes, and even banning from public events. They call them damaging to their cause, etc. Odd, considering the gender constructs that they ask others to respect. 

LGBTQ folks are largely focused on the societal construct of Gender. They modify the gender construct, since sex is largely binary, outside of birth defects and chromosomal disorders.

They (LGBTQ) have been attacked since people were aware they existed. So they are hyperaware on the matter. I mean, if I were attacked constantly, I would also be on my toes. I don't think we all need to approve of each other's lives in order to get along. 

Many LGBGTQ hate religious people with a passion, yet demand acceptance from those people. 
Many religious folks attack LGBTQ and are hateful to them, yet demand that those people accept them as practitioners of that faith. 

The World is not filled with brightest people. For instance, people who absolutely hate the entire demographic, without ever acknowledging that there individuals, and that you should care for your neighbor's well being, regardless of your view on their lifestyle choices.

It's not always going to work out easily. Just be good to one another. I was originally afraid of associating with homosexuals, because of the Army, and as well, the challenge to my sexuality, and identity. I no longer have this trouble, but I still find some of the behaviors, that I have observed to be irrational, and irritating. Speaking with a pronounced lisp, people whose identities seem to be based solely on the fact that they are a homosexual, attempt to turn, etc. Somewhat incompatible for me personally, as an introvert, as I find the in your face attitude about it to be off putting at a human level, regardless on my views of homosexuality. (Everyone has free will, and the right to chose their lives, just be good to one another.) In all honesty, I've probably known people who are gay, who I never thought were gay, because they didn't play into the stereotypes.

I honestly think that the requirement that everyone know about your sexuality is a way to alienate people to start with. Perhaps it is a defense tactic. Either you need the validation, or you want to seek approval, or you want to spot potential threats.


My observations ymmv. If we cannot have a realistic discussion on the downsides, the irritating, the bewildering, or the hateful, we can never hope to understand each other to start with. ",0
What’s wrong with saying chest pains?,0
"Pains is a verb. ""It pains me to say this."" Pain is a noun. ""The patient has chest pain.""",0
"The noun has a plural form though, which is pains. Chest pains would refer to plural chest pain.",0
"How is it possible to have plural chest pain? You have one heart. It's not pain in multiple areas of the chest. It is grammatically incorrect.

"How about all the other dictionaries that list ""pain"" as countable?  For example 

[This one](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/us/dictionary/american/pain_1)

"Again another person arguing when they dont know what they're talking about. We call that intermittent pain.

>nd you could have multiple pains in different areas of your chest. That does happen

This presentation is *exceedingly* rare and not at all when people say chest pains. They say chest pains referring to general pain over the heart without indistinguishable points. How can you argue this when you dont even know the context in which people say the expression?",0
"Funny that this is the first time you have mentioned heart attacks. You know that there are other things that can cause chest pains right? And you realize you’ve been speaking very broadly about it up until this point, right?

Good to know that you’ve read all of the medical texts so you can let me know that the words “chest pains” don’t appear in any of them. Still doesn’t mean that the term is never correct. Perhaps in this one instance of heart attacks you are correct though.",0
"Lol you literally have no idea what you are talking about. Since I have responded to hundreds of 911 calls for chest pain I don't think there is anything you could teach me about the subject unless you happen to be MD which I guarantee you are not.

In other words don't know what the hell you are talking about.

Edit- Let me add for non-cardiac causes of chest pain it still presents as pain in the generalized area. Not multiple distinguishable points like you are suggesting.

One of those growing experiences where we both needed to grow up. And we did. She was visiting--part of the cause of the breakup was she'd had to move about 200 miles away for work. After we both decided we wanted to really try, she was going to give notice and move back.

Talk to someone, please. Don't.. medicate your feelings away. I buried myself in a bottle for months after it happened to me, and all it will do is put things off. And that kind of emotional shattering, it accrues compound interest when you don't deal with it. And it scare people. 

There is nothing that you can do wrong, to try and find a way to get a sense of normalcy back. There are no rules for you, so long as you're coping. Eventually, you're going to get mad. And then later, you're going to feel shame about being mad at this person you love. Save yourself the trouble. Try to throttle that back, analyze why you're shifting in emotional spectrums, if it happens.

There are not enough condolences that can be given to you, not only for your loss, but for the future you hoped for.

As for living.

> How do I live anymore when all 26 of my years of life were spent loving somebody who I can't live for anymore? How do I make it worth it to go forward now? I want a life, but right now I'm living in a shadow and it's too much to bear even to leave bed some days. How do you handle it? Does it ever get any better than this?

Emotions are tricky. But in cases like this, you can use them to lie to yourself a little--to get through the day, even.

""What would she want me to do?""

She wouldn't want you to be broken. She would know you'd mourn, it's natural. But do you think she'd want your life to be forever fragmented? You wrote that you lived for her. I've never met you and I've never met her, but I'm willing to bet that she lived for you, too.

Honor that. Honor her judgment--make yourself worthy of that judgment. You don't need to go out and start dating, that would be a terrible, terrible idea. You're going to want to hide away, and for a while, that's expected. I am very anti-social, because large groups give me a lot of anxiety. But I found that, after spending a lot of time being.. very, very hurt and crushed, I found strength in being around others.

You'll see couples. And it'll be hard for a while. You had that once and you wish you still did. And then, one day, you're going to realize ""I had that once. And I want it again.""

I make no guarantee that, one day, you'll let this go. I don't think I will. But it'll become part of who you are. It'll integrate into your personality. Hopefully, you won't take a tinge toward bitterness, but that might happen. Whenever I wanted to be angry, I remembered how my girlfriend hated the look on my face when I was angry. And I didn't want to disrespect that, when I thought of her.

I wish you all the luck in the world. This will get better - it won't go away, but the pain will scar a little as it heals. Force yourself out of bed. Even if it's to take a shower, drive around the block. My girlfriend loved going on drives, and I avoided those routes for a long time, because they were *our* streets. One day, it felt normal again, I took a left when I had been going straight for the previous eight months.

Take a left. Even if it's just once in a while. You never know what's new down the street if you keep passing it up.",0
"the pain will pass and you will feel better little by little, and when you least expect it, you will meet another beautiful person because the universe is so god dammed in debt with you right now,  if you ever need someone to talk to pm me.

"> How do I live anymore when all 26 of my years of life were spent loving somebody who I can't live for anymore? How do I make it worth it to go forward now?

I would say now, more than before, is your chance to really live *for* her. Not just in the sense that she would most likely have wanted you to find happiness and meaning in the future, but in the fulfillment of her passions, of her hopes, of the very things that made her the unique person you took into your life. Help move that cause she believed in, bring comfort to others in your shoes, be the son her family now needs. Follow through on the things she found endearing in you and write that novel, learn that instrument, go on that trip. Make her memory mean more than sorrow. 

",0
"I would second this. Losing someone this integral to your life is not something we are born equipped to handle. A grief counselor can give you the tools and methods to help yourself process what you are going through and build your life in a healthier manner than if you were just slogging through it yourself. Please, utilize these people to help make a terrible ordeal less daunting and manageable. 

Also, it may help to think about what if the roles were switched? What if you were the one to die and she lived. What advice would you give to her. What would your hopes for her be? Follow that advice. Also, what do you think she would tell you right now? Just because she isn't physically here doesn't mean she is out of your life. She has left an indelible mark on your life, and as gut wrenching as that can be, it can also be a comfort. She may have passed, but you haven't lost her in that you probably know exactly what she would tell you to do. She will still continue to influence your life and that is a good thing. 

Sorry if that isn't a help. I have not been through a similar situation so I have no idea if that last part will be helpful or too painful. But I really wish the best for you and believe in you. I'm so sorry for your loss. ",0
"I was running a go-route (just run as fast as you can down field) while playing football and the pass was supposed to come on my left side towards the sideline so that if I couldn't catch it, nobody could catch it.  However, the ball was under thrown and to the inside so I had to come back for it.  I looked over my left shoulder and saw it was coming to the inside to I switched over to my right side caught the ball took an awkward step as I was falling forward, and I tried to roll forward, but I slipped and fell on my shoulder... *crunch*...I couldn't move my arm at all, because every time I did there was a shit load of pain. Found out it was separated and the doc said to just exercise the area and I'd be okay.  I can deal with the very minor discomfort every once in a while, but I foresee lots of pain as I get older, so I'm thinking about getting surgery in the next year or so.  

Oh, btw, I caught the ball and scored the touchdown, because it was a one-on-one route and the safety bit, plus, the cb covering me lost a step.  Feltgoodman.  :)",0

"I'm sorry to hear all that... sounds like you've got some perspective on it though, and here's one thing I'd add on top of it. Carl Jung talked about a particular kind of healer that can only come from certain kinds of injuries early in life. I know it can feel like that kind of self sacrifice and that kind of love is worth something and valuable, it's seductive... and I think part of the reason is because it can turn into something genuinely rare and healthy that not a lot of people are capable of. Sometimes the things that fuck with us the most become our greatest strength when we work through them. It's worth continuing that journey, so good luck finding the right kind of help. (personally, i think everyone should go through a few years of therapy of some kind, really unfortunate how it's been demonized as being for 'crazy' people).

It definitely starts though with finding a passion and a purpose outside of relationships though. Somewhere you can find energy, worth, pride.. that you can then bring home with you after a good day of being the kind of person you'd be proud to be. ",0

"I’m almost 30, and I’m just getting over my own “waiting to die” mentality. Depression is hell.

What helped me is the realization that I don’t really know when I’ll die. I could be here for 40 more minutes, days or even years! I could sit and wait to die, or I could make an effort to get better. 

The best thing you can do for your grandpa is to live your life as hard and as amazing as you possibly desire, then share as much as you are willing to with him. Introduce him to new ideas, new foods, and new experiences.

Have him share experiences with you! Listen to his stories. Ask him about his favorite old songs and use Spotify to listen with him. Let the playlist feature find new ones that y’all can both enjoy. What were his favorite things to do in his younger days? Do them in a way that he can now! 

More than anything though, take care of yourself. It’s hard enough to be alive and go through the day dealing with your own life. Don’t look back later and stress over what you did or didn’t do for an old man at 70 who’d given up. Sure, do your best so you won’t regret not trying. But don’t obsess and miss your own life because you’re working so hard to save his. This is why sharing YOUR experiences and passions in life is most important.",0
I’m not a guy but I am a nurse. Extreme depression after major open heart surgery is a thing. His doctor needs to know about this because he might need some meds for a bit. They can also get him into physical therapy to help improve his hand use.,0
"I'll bet he's incapable of passing up a chance to help someone else. Take him things and ask if he can fix them, or show you how to fix them (better!). ""Grandpa, my friend \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is a single mom on a tight budget and her \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ just quit working. Can you help?""   
I mean, don't make stuff up or be manipulative about it - especially don't just fabricate stuff. he's not a child and that would be insulting. But if the genuine opportunity exists, capitalize on it.  
That era of men is just so incredibly service-oriented, and often feel purposeful and show love through being of service.  
Hope not to offend anyone w/ the stereotype of that generation, but helping others is an amazing way to pull yourself back into the world of the living, and if your grandpa fits this M.O. , it might work...and be a great way for you to learn from him and connect to him, too.",0

"I work in mental health and here's what we suggest for older patients:


Seriously think about if he is depressed. Suicide is more common than you would think with older adults. They often fail to cope with limited mobility, loneliness, and aging in general. Also, they often have less protective factors than younger people. You mentioned that he had a bypass- talk with his doctor about the possibility of vascular depression.


Find an activity that he can do with other people on a regular basis. Older people often suffer from loneliness because of their decreased mobility and the deaths of old friends and family. Finding an activity with other people would give him a reason to leave the house and make new friends. Look into an elder care day program that he can go to a few times a month. Some non-profit organizations do it for free. (Obviously, this is not something you can do right now because of the COVID-19 outbreak, but you can plan for it when this is over)


Does he like animals? Think about getting him a pet, something that he would be able to care for mostly by himself. The bond with a pet can give he a reason to get out of bed in the morning.


He has a passion for maintenance work, so go with that. There are tons of forums and subreddits of people asking maintenance questions on cars, machines, anything. If he gets into that, you could even get him a webcam so he can see/talk to some people he's met online. 


Check out nia.nih.gov. They have good information that can also help.",0

"**(I'm not a guy but I was at a nursing school before my car accident and I just listed a few things below that we were taught)**

Honestly, when I was studying this in nursing, we were trained to basically just keep actively communicating with them; whether it's a one-on-one talk, bringing in the reinforcements (and educating their family on talking to them more often), or get our patients to interact with other patients who're going through something similar (sort of like a support group).

We're trained to let our patients do most of the talking because usually it involves some form of emotional/psychological trauma and/or response that is actively working as a barrier for them to ""get better"" (and yes, smoking and stress can always make things worse for patients).

You can try to get him talking about a topic he's passionate about, up to the point where you won't be able to say much but listen. We also only ask open-ended questions that lead to ""open communication"" versus ""closed communication"", meaning we only ask questions that doesn't require a single response for an answer. No yes/no questions. But simple ones like: Why? Why \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_? 

I'm not sure if this is of any help but that is basically the sum of a chapter of what we were taught. Also, pay attention to verbals and non-verbals. Always tilt/face your body to him while you guys are speaking.. don't cross your arms and/or legs. And don't stare at him. We also learned that patients don't like it when you stand over them to talk versus talking to them on the same level they are on (like sitting down on a chair if they're on a bed, etc.). Hope your grandpa is doing alright. And I hope you are too...

In his position, it is normal for him to be depressed because of his current SS and diagnosis. I think your best shot is to bring this up with his nurse/doctor in private, when you can so that you can work on an effective care plan to execute for him.",0

I'm sure he has some solid skills, and sounds like he would be proud of them, even if they're past tense. Who was his first love? How did he meet your Grandma? Views on raising kids?? Get him talking about an old passion and that may rekindle the fire, or make him want to stick around to spend time with you, stuff like that. Or feeling valued again as just a paternal figure...",0

He stopped being physically active, when he retired 10 years ago. Just sitting in front of the TV and going to the balcony for smoking and shopping groceries 2 times a week. Today he can't walk 200 meters.

Of course it hurts me to see him this way, but we can't change his behavior, no matter what we tried in the past.

He says, he is happy with his life and don't care if or when he is dying. And we accepted, that this is his decision. It's his right, isn't it? 

Currently he stays at home due to Corona, missing the last bit of movement he had while doing groceries.

The Stepfather of my SO is also 70, walks everyday, almost perfect health for his age and is doing hiking trips into the mountains a few times a year, just for contrast.

"Hey there. A few suggestions/ideas. First of all, try to get him to spend some time outside, soaking up some sun. Literally, go sit outside in the bright sun, y'all each in a chair... It helped my dad, his chest, his mental health some, the warmth helped warm him from the inside out kinda, lol. Not for hours... But for a little while. My dad really enjoyed it after his bypass, the sun is great and necessary, the vitamin d helps, etc. Go on short little walks.... Start super small.. Work up slowly. Literally around the house inside may be a starting point.. Then move outside, then around the outside, around property line, out to the mailbox, then to the nextdoor neighbors house, then try one more house after walking several times to the first house, love into second, get comfortable walking that far, move onto the next house, etc. Tell him you NEED him to do this. If not for himself right now, then for you. Talk to him about his past, his adventures in his younger years, working in the mines, what it was like, was he ever scared? How did he overcome those fears? You may even consider voice recording or even video recording him during these conversations. Tell him, be brutally honest and open about this, how much you learned from him, that you learned what it meant to be a man. Find things y'all could work on or fix together. If he can't handle doing it with his own hands, request he guide you since you're going to need some knowledge as you age/ grow up too. If you can't figure out something to have him work on, see if you can find any old things from a thrift store near by that you can get and say you really liked it but can't seem to get it to work. Or check out eBay or Craigslist for some older electronics, tools, etc. 

If he's being a real piece of work, an ass or being a dick to others sometimes (hard and set in his stubborn ways that sometimes can lead to grumpy old guys being an ass to others, lol)... Tell it to him straight. Be honest. Say you're being a dick about this. You still have life to live. We aren't done with you yet here. You havent seen me do these things, experienced these with me, etc etc. I know it's hard. I know it hurts. But we all know your a badass and can handle it. So do it for us. You don't have to run a marathon.... But let's just do wee small walks/exercises/chair exercises/etc to gain back some strength and stamina. You can do this..... So please do it for me.

"What has he taught you about being a man? Can you elaborate what that means to you and him? I cannot be sure but it might be part of the problem. 

What happens often to old people or those with increasing disabilities is that they can lose their sense of purpose and meaning. You are describing a man who has worked his body to the bone and who now physically cannot even get up to mow the lawn. It is likely that he equates a lot of his value to feats of physical labour and to providing financially for his family. (You know, the way capitalism can inspire men to think of themselves...)

Now his body is broken and others rely less and less on him. On some level he may think a man shouldn't rely too much on others and he doesn't want to waste other people's time and effort trying to fix him while they could be doing better things. 

If this is the case, then the most important thing is this: Your grandpa has value even if he cannot work. Your grandpa has value even when he's just sitting there waiting to die. You already know this, because you made this post. It's likely he doesn't know. You may need to point-blank tell him so and also that you love him regardless of what condition his body is in. If you cannot say this, say it with actions. The best way to do this is just to spend time with him without any expectations of his recovery. Talk to him, be as open as you can about your life, ask him for advice or his opinion on things. Or say nothing and sit in the garden or in front of the TV together. Just be there.

He will enjoy it and feel he contributes something to your life and to others in ways that he possibly hasn't considered much before (just by being someone's friend, by making people laugh, passing on knowledge and skills, etc.). If he can value life through that perspective he just might get up and do the work to stick around longer. Not for himself but for others. In the end it will be his decision to make, but if it doesn't work, you will at least still have made the most of your time together.",0
"When my mom passed away my dad got super depressed and gave up on himself. He also smokes and basically stopped eating. He lives with me now so he is doing better since I’m feeding him but I’ve stopped lecturing him about his health because it doesn’t seem to help.

I’ve realized it’s not my place to try to make him see my side of things (especially because he’s a grumpy old man set in his ways) but rather to just try to listen to him as much as I can. I think he finds comfort in being listened to (as we all do). That is the only advice I have to give, do your best to spend time with your grandfather and ask him about life and even the uncomfortable things like how he feels about death. Old people aren’t afraid to talk about uncomfortable things. Try to understand his perspective as much as you can so that you can make peace and respect whatever decisions he makes about his life. It may inadvertently give him a will to live, especially if you find out things he likes and make plans to do things with him in the future like make his favorite food for him or whatever. But be warned that old men don’t like to be bothered about changing and they’re smart enough to know when you’re trying to make them change.

I littered some links below as well for more reading. 

To be clear yes, we are talking about Magic Mushrooms.  Yes they are halucinagenic, yes they are really far out, but they also tend to transform the lives of those who use them for the better especially in the case of end of life care. 

Now I understand that this suggestion might seem extreme and the payoff lofty, but I have personally had a trip change my life. I was a single 350lb disabled veteran who was on the verge of suicide. I was offered to try mushrooms by a friend and it was the single most transformative experience in my life. 

Since then I have lost 70 lbs, found a person who loved me for who I was we got married, discovered a love of philosophy and an appreciation for the world around me. More over I learned to accept myself and remembered that I was worth making effort for. It truly changed my life. 

Now I know what you are prolly thinking. ""This guy is nuts"" but there are studies that back this up and if he wouldn't be massively opposed to it, you might consider this route.  I really and truly hope that he is able to remember that he is worth trying for, with or without a trip.

"> I’m just getting over my own “waiting to die” mentality

My grandfather passed away in 2014. He was older, obviously, but not old. If healthy, he'd likely would have had another 20 years in him. Sadly, not at all healthy. 

When we've discussed my grandparents, my mom has always said ""They've been old my whole life"". Basically - Even when in their 20s/early 30s raising my mom and uncle, they acted like elderly people waiting to die. Not active, adventurous, ambitious, curious, nothing. Not feeling like the world is positive or happy or reliable. Always bitter, really.

It blew my mind when I looked back and realized they were in their 40s when they became grandparents (when I was born). My entire childhood memories with them are ""elderly"" so I just figured they were always old. The only TV they watched was the weather channel on mute. They woke up at 3-4AM every morning as long as I can remember. They spent their days sitting in rocking chairs occasionally saying a short sentence to each other or doing a word search puzzle. But most of all, so little seemed to truly bring them happiness. 

Long story short - I am glad you've found some help and peace <3 I wouldn't wish a miserable ""waiting to die"" life on anyone else.",0

I agree with the suggestion of a pet. I don't know if he'd be able to care for a dog or have the help required for the maintenance but after my grandfather's stroke his wife left him so he went into a very dark place and the one thing that sparked some joy in his life was my aunt's dog.

"It's far easier to reduce your need for willpower than to increase willpower itself. To do that, you need to reduce stress, increase energy, decrease your mental burden and increase your mental reward.

You reduce your stress and increase your energy by exercising and stretching. Of course, you might need willpower to exercise, but imo, if you're going to use your willpower anywhere you should use it for exercising. It's really that important.

Decreasing burden and increasing reward are basically about improving motivation. It's become popular lately to dismiss motivation and say that discipline is all that matters. While I agree that motivation isn't necessary to actually do anything, and that discipline is often necessary, I disagree that motivation should be ignored. Motivation can be constructed and maintained through CBT techniques and writing.

Mindfulness meditation is another thing people will mention. I think it's helpful, but mindfulness is kind of like discipline because they both involve a bypass effect in the mind.

With mindfulness, you bypass your normal brain activity by maximizing awareness. With discipline, you bypass your normal brain activity by outlasting its effect. In both cases, you're not directly doing anything to existing circuitry, you're just waiting for the brain to choose a different path. Over time that will result in changes, but it's definitely ""over time"".

But with CBT and writing, you do something that's nearly the opposite. Instead of bypassing normal brain activity, you crank everything up and reverse the ""flow"" directly at what's troubling you. It's violent and much more immediately effective. Instead of constantly having to bypass brain circuits you don't like, you just destroy them.

At least, that's how it feels to me.

I actually disagree with CBT's insistence that thoughts ultimately cause emotions, but I can't argue against the effectiveness of the writing exercises. They've helped me a lot and I now immediately go to writing about my behavior when I'm not satisfied with it. The book that really helped me is, ""Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy"".",0

"I think losing the weight, either through hard work, or surgery, is a step in the right direction. I know it was hard for me. But them being that overweight in the first place is not the root problem, it's only a symptom of something more sinister, a disorder so deep that they did not care a bit about their own health and were on the path to slow suicide. 

If they had a true endocrine disorder, they get a pass. If not, they might have had some emotional disorder, and I'd really wonder if they had really treated it properly. Surgery only treats the weight issue, it does not treat any underlying emotional problems. This is why I'm frustrated with the show ""My 600lb life"", they mention nothing about treating the patient's emotional status.

"Not necessarily passed to another guy... It's just that because of Covid when she was in labour, I was not allowed in the delivery room.... Nor the waiting room, nor the nursery, and only managed to sneak in the ward when both my kid and SO were already stressed and tired for the whole thing. 

Not to mention that we last saw each other 4 days before she was admitted in the hospital. Yes, she was in labour for a few days and the baby was still 7 months 3 weeks in. Doctors decided to try and atleast have the baby reach 8 months before they deliver. So they pumped my SO with meds to help her and my unborn child reach 8 months. And at 8 months exactly SO said she can't handle this shit anymore and baby i think thought the same so poof baby out and the next day we leave and go home.

"Therapy.  I'm serious.

My father was an abusive alcoholic for a lot of my childhood and adolescence, though he's since gotten his act together.  When I was a little older, I learned a bit about his history - a parent who died when he was a toddler, emigration in childhood, and a few other things that would definitely send someone spiraling if they didn't have the capacity to cope with it.  And he didn't.  Recently I reached the age he was when things started going downhill for him - he had two kids and a mortgage, and I've got a two cats and a goddamn playstation.  It was stress on top of trauma, and he didn't know how to handle it.

It is *incredibly difficult* to have compassion for people whose trauma, through little fault of their own, has been dumped on you like that.  I'm getting there - I recognize that there were forces that he just didn't have the tools to deal with and I had the misfortune of being economically dependent on him.  But acknowledging that doesn't get my adolescence back, and I still have occasions where I think back to what's happened and become extremely angry - at him - in the moment.  It feels like one step short of a flashback.  Over the last ten years or so I have made incredible personal strides overcoming the effects that living in that household for 20 years had on me, which only further illuminates the possibilities - the person  that I could have been - if things were different.  It's wasted potential, an alternate reality that thinking about feels like watching a party through a living room window from the sidewalk outside before continuing on my way.

You seem to have the right outlook - you appear to be angry at the situation and not the person, and you want to not feel the way you do about an unwell individual.  It is my recommendation that you tell a therapist everything that you put in your OP.  It's well-written enough that you could probably just print it off and hand it to him/her.

Good luck.",0

"It depends on what you are going through but **PATIENCE** is a big factor. It takes a long time and a lot of work to be in a position where you are able to support yourself while simultaneously being in pain.


**DO NOT BLOCK** out your emotions and try to ""push through it"". Try an approach like this example. You are feeling anxious/sad/angry over something. Notice that feeling. Say to yourself, or more accurately to *those emotions*, ""thank you for trying to help and protect/defend me, I appreciate your efforts, but I don't need that right now.""


Find a form of **EXPRESSION** to get it out. Set some time (just 5 or 10 mins may be enough) daily or as needed to journal on pen and paper or spam your keyboard with what's in your head. Allocating time can alleviate the fixation/thought loop aspect of it all. Additionally any artistic form works. Poetry, drawing, crafting, making music. Creativity is a good way to get into flow state. Just DO some activity.


**LEARN** about everything your mind is going through. The psychology of it, the nuances, concepts of experiences, how they affect you, triggers, reactions you have, how to react better than your default, outdated wiring. Read, watch videos, listen to podcasts, research. Anything that directs you to better understanding is useful.


Have a little set of **PHRASES** you look at every day to affirm things and solidify positive concepts in your head. E.g. ""This too shall pass"", ""self-compassion"", ""patience"", ""accept how you feel and allow it to pass""., ""Remember to breathe"". It's cringe but it can be useful to nudge your mind in a better direction.


Use mediums that **HELP YOU FEEL** your way through things. Music, movies etc. They can be good tools to comfort you in your pain through empathetic means. Music for me is like a best friend.


Add moments of **SELF CARE**, it doesn't have to be as drastic or cringe as people use the term nowadays, just small moments where you treat yourself to a casual treat. Crack open a beer, let yourself outside for some greenery and air, put on a face mask, make some hot chocolate, take a nice soak in a bath. Something small to distract.


If things are more severe and you are seriously in a bad state of mind and unable to escape, call your country's hotline (it isn't only for if you are about to jump off a bridge). Sometimes we really are pushed to require other people, and an actual voice is necessary at times. Before this stage, if there is any possibility of contacting someone you trust like a friend or family member, do that first. It can be incredibly hard to reach out and use others but I believe it's necessary as a prerequisite to making yourself your most reliable point of contact.

I think slowly and gently is the only way to sway their way of thinking. And even that won’t sway it a ton.

I am trying hard not to pass off the worst traits to my daughter. It's difficult and I am not always successful. I am grateful that children are very resilient and forgiving of their parent's flaws.

The more difficult task really is to ensure you don't go so far overboard the other direction that you screw your child up in another way.  

If you practice a degree of restraint with everything, and everything is done in moderation, your children will be fine. 

What they really need are:

* Your time, care and concern.
* Proper discipline on behaviour, manners, etiquette
* Proper setting and enforcement of boundaries
* Set expectations & encouragement

Just moderate. It's fine if you aren't perfect, but make sure you show them another side as well. For example, if you reprimand them, make sure you also praise them at other times. Make sure you are fair. It's only when they grow up hearing reprimand all the time or praise all the time that they end up imbalanced and messed up.

It's even OK to tell your child you are disappointed, as long as you also regularly tell them how proud of them you are.

Don't get so caught up with trying to undo your parents' flaws that you introduce other flaws. Children are resilient. As long as you are fair, they will understand.",0
"I think the answer is compassion: compassion for parents, compassion for your kids, etc. No parent starts out saying, “I want to do the worst job ever raising these kids.” But with the struggles of life, our own baggage, personal characteristics, something crummy sometimes happens. I’ve learned that about my parents, and sometimes I catch myself being less than I want to be with my kids. The kicker is that, despite your best efforts, your children may resent you for something they deem to be wanting in your role as a parent. Let them have their opinions. You have yours. But love your parents and your kids either way, and stuff will turn out for the best. It’s a tall order, but what we practice, we usually become good at. Practice compassion.",0

How you act and behave is based partially on your parents behavior/actions, but also on your own choices and behavior.

"First of all, I'm sorry for your loss. I'm remembering you that you have to deal with it, as it is the only way.

I lost my father 14 years ago when I was 18 years old. I was starting my degree, and it just left me shocked and hopeless. It took me a long time to understand this, especially at such a young age, and I would say that it took me 2/3 years of grief to finally understand what this meant. One day, I woke up on the day he died and I dreamed about him, dressed in white, sitting on a family table and laughing a lot. Just after I woke up that I realized that it was 3 years after the whole incident. It reminded me: I surpassed the hardest part of the grief, I finally accepted the situation and I could truly see that wherever he is, he is happy and watching us. 

But the grief never truly goes away 100%. It comes back to you, once in a while.

Every year, and since 10 years ago, on father's day and on the day of his death, I write about him. I share stories about him on social media. I found it was truly the best way for my ghosts to leave and also, for people to keep remembering how great of a man he was. It is a tough exercise for me, as usually leaves me in tears (and others as well). But it is also a cathartic process that helps me moving on every time I seem to go back to it. And for people to remember him.

The most important lesson for me was that death isn't the last chapter of life. The last chapter is love. And that will always stick you more in the end, replacing hurt as time goes by. The hurt never truly goes away, but the love will be so much more that you won't even think that much about it.",0

Time might not heal it all but it will ease some of the hurt. If you don’t want to get up one morning, that’s fine, do what you feel will make you feel better in that moment. It’s a sad part of life indeed, but at the same time it is a time to reflect on the life of a great man and all his achievements, including you.

"My dad passed away last year. I got the news when my mom called me at work. I had to sit down. I didn't  cry at first, I had to process a sudden change in my life. It took me 30 minutes to walk out. Another 5 to 10 minutes to start the car. I teared up, i get home, nobody is home. I start cleaning up the mess where he died and paramedics left everything behind. I didn't  want my mom to do the clean up, so I started doing the hard part of throwing his clothes in the bags, his things. I tell you, I'm  a tough guy and that was the toughest thing I ever did in my entire life. It took me what felt like eternity to throw in a handful of clothes into the bag. It was a huge  mental process for me. I started crying privately in the bathroom. 

Friends and families came together. It helped with the process period. There was moments where I was pure rage when i got into an argument with my older brother, trying to help him and he gets argumentative when I am asked to help him with something. We cooled down, reset and recognized we're  on edge. 


On the day of the wake, the first viewing impacted me. This is real. I did not cry yet, not in front of anybody. I dont do that. Later in the second viewing, i was high from weed. I was between life and death when i looked at this inanimated  body that is no longer my dad. In awe at the nature of life and the universe. I could not comprehend such thing. 

Once everyone was gone for the last viewing and i had the room to myself, i cried quietly as I said my last good bye. Absorbing the final moment and the fact of life. In the back,  my ex girlfriend and my closest cousin was waiting for me. They were there for me, respecting my privacy. 

After one week, i focused on work, kept busy with friends and family. Kept my mom company. I just keep going with life. Cleaned up the whole house. The hard part was finally over. 

From time to time i do a moment of reflection. I cry every now and then, thinking about my dad. Typing this right now does not make me sad or happy. Everything just is for me. A fact of life.",0
"8yrs has already passed, and I am still dealing with his death. Some days were okay, some were worse. It is so hard when you had so much memories and dreams together, and only one of us will continue it.

I still keep my promise of buying him a pickup and use it in our farm.",0
"My deepest condolences to you and your family.

While there is no guide book for grieving, we know about the stages of grief and that talking to others kind of helps.

Listening to music, remembering good times, crying alot are some of the ways we cope with the loss of a loved one.

My Father passed away over 1 year ago and it's still difficult.",0
"Lost my day nearly a year ago. May 8, he passed on his birthday. He had battled Parkinson’s for 13 years and it was time. The years seemed to drag on forever, his change was slow and depression and dementia came along with the progression. I grieved for years before he passed and felt some relief when it was finally over but I miss him every single day.",0
"Lost my dad 10 years ago to brain cancer.  I worked 3rd shift at the time, so I took him to radiation every morning, made him breakfast, helped with his insulin, then just talked about anything and everything under the sun.  It was the worst and greatest 6 months at the same time.  I still tear up during certain moments in movies, or when certain songs come on (Walk with me in Hell by Lamb of God was the first song I heard after he passed, I cry like a fucking baby every time I hear it now).  Pre-cancer he would call every Sunday regardless if I had just seen him or not and ask me the same three questions: How are the kids, how's work going, and how's the car running.  I wish I could still get those calls...",0
My parents divorced when I was very young and my dad was never really in my life. When he died I didn't feel anything because he never gave my family and it felt like the passing of a stranger.,0
"My father passed away a few years ago when I was 28. I'm 30 now and the best advice I can give is to be present (physically if at all possible) for your surviving family. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, your mom, your siblings - be that person they know they can talk to openly about their feelings about losing someone so close - Laughs, tears, and everything in between.   


It's my belief that all father's wish for their sons to rise to the occasion when they are gone, and frankly it helps us out as much as it does others to be honest with that human pain of loss. Like many of the other comments suggest, you best honor the dead by living their virtues everyday and integrity comes easy when you devote yourself to aiding the ones you love.",0
"I'm really sorry for your loss. I had a considerably different experience when my father passed away. He was abusive and I hadn't talked to him for about 20 years before he died. I felt nothing but relief. While I can't possibly understand your grief, I also can't understand the joy you had for 30 years.

My point in telling you this is that you have memories. Really good memories. Hold onto those. Write them down. Cherish them, and never forget the wonderful influence that your Dad had on your life. 

Live up to his example, make him proud.",0
"As well as I can. 

Father passed in January. Be honest about how you are with yourself. Ask friends for help, seek therapy, and try to be the best parts of him going forward. 

It's exhausting honestly, but it is starting to help. Find folks you can lean on, and lean.",0
For me maybe it was a little easier because he’d been sick for like 6 to 10 years before he passed. The hardest part was the first time I picked up the phone to call and tell him something and I realize that I couldn’t.,0
"My dad died when I was an infant, so I know next to nothing about him. I don't know how he looks like, how he and mom met, just basic stuff, I just have some limited information about him, which doesn't help me understand him as a person. But he's ALWAYS in my mind and I miss him a lot. In the past even with the slight mention of ""your dad"" I started to cry, it hurt so bad. I feel like if he was with me I would have been a better person than I am now and maybe would have common hobbies like playing guitar... Oooh, I can almost imagine jamming together to classic metal tracks... That would have been sick, hah. I really hope he's proud of me that I don't dwell on his passing, instead I go forward with my life and do my best.

Mom never mentions him like it's something taboo. Around 7-8 years ago she started dating a guy who is now my ""step-dad"", but I just can't stand him(not in a bad way), initiates a conversation when he needs help with something(most of the time doesn't), almost never speaks to me directly(it's mom most of the time: ""Tell (me) to ___.). I don't hate him, don't get me wrong, it's just I don't feel him as a father figure, it doesn't feel natural and I don't want to engage with him.

At least I have around a month until I finish high school, after that, I'll go to my uncle abroad and I don't wanna hear anything from him.",0
"Seeing a church full of people who all came to pay their respects, every single one of them had more than one fond memory to share of time spent with my Dad.  Being able to say that while he was not perfect or without flaws, he was a good man and lived to do his best by everyone in his life.  Standing in front of all these people to eulogize a man I was proud to call my father helped take the sting out of his sudden passing.",0
A big thing to know is it will not really hit you for a few weeks.  You will be so busy the next few weeks with the funeral and all the other stuff to really think about it.  It is after everything finally slows down when it really hits you.  At least that was how it was for me after my dad passed suddenly when I was 35.,0
"I cried and played video games.
As time has passed and I have reevaluated my childhood with him and mom told me more stories about how he was abusive and just horrible I have cared less and less about his death. I miss h but I'm not devastated by his loss I once was. My family doesn't like that. They chose to remember the dying caner patient and not the horrible man he was before cancer.
He never admitted the stuff he did wrong.",0
"I'm really sorry for your loss. My dad passed away in 2016 and I will miss him till it's time for me to join him. I normally cry from missing him on my birthday, then I'll laugh thinking of what he would say if I he knew I cried about him on my bday. ""Damn son, I appreciate that and all, but... damn."" 

It is hard, but it gets better. Like a lot of folks have said, it is one day at a time. I had a hard time with the dreams after he died, I would see him in my dreams and get mad because I knew he wasn't supposed to be there. Eventually I got to where I could just enjoy having him around again, even if just in a dream.  Hang in there =)",0
"Mine passed when I was 11.  I didn’t fully understand at the time the detriment that it would cause growing up. I’m 25 now and definitely get jealous  seeing my friends become best friends with their dad as they get older. I was robbed of that but I try not to think about it too much. 

I got a good 10 years with him but wish I got more. The memories will always be with me but I’m starting to lose memory of him- outside of the memories. He was my best friend, we did everything together. 

I’m losing memory of his voice and him in general as it’s been so long but I’ll always remember how he made me feel.

Cliche but true: Time heals all wounds my friend. Sorry for your loss. Dads are pretty cool.",0
Damn I still got my dad & he got a stroke in may of 2018 which I got to witness... the thought of losing him breaks me down instantly,0
"First off.... so sorry for your loss.  When my dad passed 5 years ago I basically went fetal.  I took three weeks off work as I could not function.  To this day I think, ""oh I should call dad, he'll know the answer"".  They same time heels all wounds but I think you adjust to your new normal.",0
"My dad died at the beginning of 2010, a week before what would have been his 68th birthday. Me and him didn't really have a good relationship at all. He was in my life every day of my life, but didn't offer anything positive in my life, and might as well have not been there at all. Wouldn't have been any worse off. He was more of an anti-role model than anything - the kind of man I never wanted to be. He told alot of lies and took advantage of everyone around him for his own personal gain. He always sought the praises of man, presenting himself as this exaggeratedly greater character than he ever actually was, but mistreated those closest to him behind closed doors. He was extremely restricting and controlling. It was his way, no highway. You didn't have a right to a voice or an opinion that conflicted with his. When he passed, I felt nothing at all because I didn't feel like I lost anything precious or valuable or even important, just a great weight off my shoulders. I could finally ""live in peace"".",0
"Wow this is how I feel, even lost our fathers 5 days apart mine the 25th of October last year. I'm 18 and I feel if i even had a year or two more of growing as a person I would have been able to start getting to know him and I feel so bitter that he passed when he did.",0
"This is such a valid point, they may not be here in the physical but there are plenty of ways they can still live through the living. My folks are still alive, although the relationship is strained. 

However My grandparents passed (my dads parents) and I didn’t have much of a relationship with them, but as I grow I realise how similar I was to my grandmother

Same cooking style, same taste in furniture and art

Even the way I get cake off a knife,using both fingers is something she used to do

She is always with me, my grandparent worked real hard, too hard on reflection and when they left this place their children fought over the money. Because that’s what was valued growing up

I work now but only enough to get by, things are tight but my children have what they need. A present mother. they showed me what I needed to see by being who they were and this goes both ways. Sometimes people do this by being what we what to be, however sometimes we become what we are by seeing what other people do and choosing not to be like them. 

Just because someone isn’t physically there, it doesn’t mean they are not always there. It’s what they did that impacts what you do...this is there eternal legacy 

I didn’t expect this, I didn’t expect the grandparent I hardly knew and hardly saw to have one of the greatest impacts of my life.

Being who they were has helped shape who I am, very unexpected indeed♥️",0
"Probably gym because you're always moving around. The easiest class to ""pass out of in"" was History because we watched a lot of old war movies. Those where some good sleeps...",0
AP Calc 2. Barely passed it in high school. Had to retake in undergrad because I failed the AP test in HS. Did very poorly and retook again for a B-. I honestly have no idea why it was so much harder than Calc 1 and Calc 3 but it was awful.,0
"I ditched most of my high-school classes, then tested out in the last few weeks of senior year with a generic pass-fail grade. I lived a block from the school, and had a swimming pool, so I'd show up for homeroom, and my comp-Sci and physics classes because they had the same teacher and his wife worked with my mother, so if I didn't show up there, I'd have been caught. But then at lunch, I'd gather up my friends (mostly girls) and we'd hop the fence and go back to my house to hang out poolside. Good times.

But the classes were not difficult. Granted it wasn't a great school. But I easily aced all the exit exams without any study. And I'm smart, but not a super genius or anything. The only thing I struggled with academically was paying attention. Glad My parents didn't put me on rittolin like so many other kids of my generation, I'm happier not being a 4' tall meth addict like most of those other kids turned out. So yeah, ignoring counsolers and therapists, laziness, arrogance and sexy pool parties somehow paid off. I don't recommend that for others, but don't over estimate the importance of high-school.",0

Dude go seek a financial advisor. I highly recommend a smartvestor pro through Dave Ramsey’s site. Get rid of your debt first so you can enjoy the money that belongs to you alone! Sorry about your father passing but so happy to hear he was able to set you up for a financial success like that. As a father of two my legacy to my children will be the type of people they become and hopefully the ability to leave our grandkids money as our kiddos hopefully won’t have a need :) your father must have cared so deeply about you.,0
"I think you should get an appointment at your own bank in order to get someone to help you build an investment portfolio. I have a friend who did that when her mother passed. She now have a secured future financially and she didn't had to be a financial mogul to get there. Respect and listen to everything they tell you. Also keep some money aside for you. If you invest the whole thing and need money in a year from now you might loose a pourcentage of it. Lots of investment needs to stay at least two years (sometimes more) before you can withdraw them without penality.

If you want to trade you'd be safer starting with mock account. Lots of platforms offer this and use the real stock market which can help you understand. Read a lot about it. It's not easy as movies and YouTube videos would like us to think. I cannot stress this enough do not trade your money without taking the time to read everything and get informed properly 

Real estate can be a good investment. Not financially wise. With this economic climate don't invest in real estate thinking you'll be the next Barbara Corcoran because you most likely won't. I personally see Real Estate as a good investment in your future. A friend of mine bought a triplex and his mortgage is paying itself with the rent from his two renters and he has a almost free of charge place to live. Real estate ain't like it was before it is a long shot long run investment but it is a good one!",0
"Since it's AskMen and not any of the finance subs, the way I've always dealt with windfalls is in thirds:  1/3 for stupid shit ( the ol' hookers and blow fund ... or whatever your stupid thing is ), 1/3 for paying debts and investments, 1/3 for capital improvements to your life ( purchases that make your day to day meaningfully better over at least 10 years -  a new car or a new microwave or whatever friction cash can fix in your day to day ).

With millions, the hookers and blow fund might be ginormous so you might want to scale that back.  Or donate it to causes you ( or the giver ) care about.  Or give it to friends and family or whatever.  Or buy your buddy a lambo.

The capital fund is probably best for your house and cottage at that scale.  Just make sure that it doesn't hurt your career.  If you're living paycheque to paycheque and hate your job go back to school and use the fun fund to get it done.  The point is to spend this bucket on meaningfully ( and it's key that the purchases are meaningful ) improving your life.  If you don't know what's meaningful to you, roll this into the debt and capital fund until you do.

Pay all your debts first and then talk to a financial advisor for the remainder in the investment fund.  This is what you'll pass to the next generation and it's your responsibility to manage it well.

Also, windfalls are never things that change my job's ability to fund my life - that's always mine and earned by me through my work and personal luck.

No matter how much is left to you, I would watch out for the ennui from not needing to work or living solely off of passive income and having nothing meaningful in your life besides the next mai tai.  It also makes it easier to deal with guilt and imposter syndrome and whatever else negative comes into your life from having a pile of cash.  If you like your job, don't tell anyone and just keep at it.  Just because you can do nothing, doesn't mean that will make your life happy.

Best of luck!",0

"Was in the same situation 2 weeks ago. My lifelong best and closest friend had his father pass away, he’s 20 years old. Hit like a train when i heard. 


Don’t overthink this - be there for him, dont say too much or try and be extra, just physically and mentally be there with him. Everyone grieves differently, but theres rarely anyone who wants to grieve alone. A bit later down the line, take him out and help him distract his mind from things.",0
"I find studying is a great way to learn things and pass the time.

Videogames and reading also helps quite a bit.",0
"People come into your life for a reason and a season.  We as humans don't have the emotional or mental capacity to handle too many intense personal connections.  If you felt every one of those 200,000 deaths a day the same way you felt the death of a friend, you'd never be able to get off the couch.

You have to cultivate your circle for the time.  Some people will remain in there forever, and some people will pass through.  And while it's impossible to demand an exact balance, don't spend too much energy on someone that doesn't care much about you, and don't let people give you everything if you don't want to return that roughly in kind.",0
"Perhaps ask yourself what impact you have made to be memorable? Everyone becomes memorable to someone either because they elevated them or destroyed them. Be the one who elevates, give out what you hope to receive. You won’t ever be truly happy passively living while waiting to die. Nor should you ever expect someone else to “make me happy” especially when you cannot do that for yourself. No one knows you better than you, perhaps figure out why you’re not happy with yourself and why you feel invisible.",0
"You would be surprised who would be affected if you disappeared or passed away. How many times have you heard say ""I had no idea what he was going through"" or ""I never thought it could happen to anyone that I know"" about people school friends or colleagues?

It's important to realise that although we are mostly looking out for our own interests, we affect and are affected by those around us. Don't rely on anyone else for your own happiness but don't underestimate the your impact on people.",0
"I.. don’t exactly surpass others in literature and nor am I adept in expressing my thoughts so I’ll try my best. 

Reading this has reeled me back into thoughts that I have far forgotten but looking at it now I perceive a better perspective on the situation.
Look at the human population (7.8 billion... BILLION) rather the 200,000.. it can make anyone feel small but the reason I’m bringing this up is how many people can you give a f#$k about? Because we are busy.. busy humans dealing with whatever bull$@&t we were born into and trying to live out everyday with the need to constantly satisfy ourselves. 

Taking all this situational BS into account some people don’t care even for their own keen, it’s sad truly; but that is what makes it so beautiful when you find people to call your own.

Finding people you can call your own can be tough sometimes but looking at people who care about another person at a lower level, you can take this comment section as an example for we cared/had a respect for this person we didn’t even know about and taking the time/emotion to share with you.

If you’re at the end of this, thank you for the time spent reading.. and I hope you the best luck along your ways.",0
"Iv also never felt understood and it's given me a great sadness over the years, but remember no one can literally know your inner thoughts and in which case no one can truly know anyone else cause if people did know each other deep down on a inner level then there would be no mystery or thrill in the world. Something Iv done is start by understanding yourself and I know that sound fickle and cliche to say) but knowing that you probably think and review everything you see and do constantly, and take great consideration into your action and are probably pretty self aware, it does the mind good to take a step out of yourself and understand yourself outside of your own shoes and try and think of yourself in a grander scale. Yes we will all be one of those deaths. And being known or appreciated and missed seldomly actually coincide, the my most humble greatest man that has ever lived has came and passed and I'm sure not a soul ever really knew him or appreciated him and is probably lost in time. People will love and miss Kim kasdashiam and Justin beiber but have no inherent value. Don't let your value amd people perception and care for you share their meanings. We are all going to live here and being able to live with yourself is a value of its own, doing what your can for the people around you truly with out appreciation has its own rewards, and just being apart of a community anyway you can will give you some center, because trust me wanting the need to be known and understood is a fruitless effort cause if your pushing to have it, that will get further away, in that respect, let that part come to you",0
"I think this is one of the reasons we're meant to look for a significant other. Most of the people in our life don't care about us you're probably right, but if you want to feel really significant to someone, and pass your significance back to them, look to that.",0
"We can't dwell on pain even if we love someone that's passed/disappeared. People still care even if its not explicitly mourning. I lost my grandad last month and he was basically a stand in dad. I cried alot the first day, but after that I focused on remembering him and the times that we had that were special to me. He used to show me old black and white horror movies when I was a kid (Night of the Living Dead, Dracula, etc.), and I've rewatched some of them and checked out some new ones recently. To someone looking in it probably seems like I just enjoy old movies. Sometimes people care in their own way. If people don't care as much as you'd like or in the way you'd like try to not take it personally because it only serves to make you unhappy about something you can't change. Enjoy your life and the people in it that do care.",0
"It’s true that if any of us pass along the world will continue, as it always has for eternity no matter who dies, such is the nature of the world.  But I feel your sentiment too.  my younger brother feels a lot like what you describe.  He attempted to leave the family in a really weird way which I won’t get into too deep (but he sent an email basically saying goodbye), but he though that no one cares about him and it wouldn’t be a big deal and he wouldn’t be missed.  He was wrong, very wrong and we made sure to let him know this. The thing is that he has always been a bit of a know it all (he’s 28) and distanced in life, no matter how we approach him he knows it all and has always been distant and pretends like everything is ok
When it obviously isn’t - avoiding being honest with your situations in a way denies those around you to respond to it honestly. Basically some elements of it are mental health related for him and some of us how he has chosen consciously or not to engage with the world.  I’m not saying this is it isn’t what your going through I can only share my experience that your not alone in this feeling and hope some sort of it provides some insight.  And I would tell you the same thing I told my brother and why I have experienced.  Don’t believe everything you think, and about what other people think especially.  Some family really does suck though, I recently lost my father and I think that sort of put him over the edge.  The upshot is he’s finally starting to deal with his feeling or recognize that he has been suppressing them which is a step in the right direction.  You are not alone, I have a big family and in our grief each of us goes through that process differently, so it is for everyone it’s not really for anyone else to determine how one “should” process such things, us humans don’t come with instruction manuals lol.  while going through that process I learned that some people I thought were my rocks in life turned out not to be, and some people surprised me with how strongly and supportive they were especially in the beginning when I was going through such a tough place.  We think we know so much about the character of the people around us but in truth we all live in our heads more then we do in reality and it can color our experience Ma and behaviors.  On close friends I am of the type for quality over quantity, but I hit a couple phases where I realized my circle was a lot smaller then I thought and it was tough, but with the right mentality those tough times ended up being my times of greatest growth (I’m in my early 40s).  Focus on what brings you joy and the relationships with the people that do so as well, for me this is a combination of intuition/feeling and logic.  The people around us tend to react to a combination of where they’re at in their headspace and where we’re at in ours, both influencing each other, keep the company of those that have a healthy dynamic with you in this way where you make each other better.",0
"Do you want people to sit around and dwell on thoughts of you a lot? I don't think that's a reasonable idea. People are self centered. They are concerned with their own wants, needs, desires. If their concerns involve you then you are thought of frequently. If you are more peripheral to their experience, then you are thought of much less. Being understood is a whole other kettle of fish. To understand someone, really KNOW them, requires exposure to them over time and a variety of situations. A track record is created until they KNOW what you'll do or say...and then you do or say something they didn't expect. Humans are a very multifaceted critter, that's what makes us semi interesting. I consider myself as pretty average. The people who KNOW me is an extremely small number. There are some people who have experienced facets of me, but there are facets of the diamond they have zero clue about. I like it that way. I am a very self contained person, need very little in the way of validation or approval. Others are very much different. Social platforms are their natural habitat. You are familiar with people who live their lives on social media. To me, that is totally alien. With all that said, I am quite empathetic and conscious of others moods and feelings. I have a step daughter who literally felt compelled to 'make' everyone like her. It was hard for her to absorb that there are people who simply are NOT going to be wild about her. My attitude is 'take me or leave me', and usually I'm happy if they leave me. Different strokes for different folks.",0
"You can have a life where people care about you. But, that only happens through selfless acts. You don't draw many people thinking only about yourself. I don't know your background or what trials you've faced but, for me I know this to be true experientially. When I was going through a trying time in my life I met a person who I can't even really call a friend but, they bought me food when they saw I was starving. This was all they did yet I remember them still almost a decade after they died and still I miss them. Just a chance meeting caused that much and more. Because they were kind to me I lived long enough to be kind to others. Compassion and selfless acts are like a fire that grows and grows warming each person who comes to it. Each person taking some warmth away with them perhaps to start their own fires.

And if this warmth is all of me that will live on, i'll be remembered more than well enough. I don't know if you know this but, it's very common for people who are abused to abuse their kids in an self replicating cycle. It's a sad truth. However, I believe it's also true that a good heart and right treatment may be passed down as well. So perhaps the good acts you do will never truly die.",0
"At the end if the day, the person anyone cares about most is themselves... After that it depends on the person.

Most of your friends and family (provided you're on good terms) will care about your passing for a bit, but the show must go on. Time waits for no man... but those you've built a deep connection with, your close family, will remember.

Honestly, it's not the worst thing ever. As long as those I care about care about me, nothing else matters.",0
"Most people also suck at sharing their emotions. 

There was a guy who I took some classes with. We sat next to each other, shared study guides, and talked about future academic plans. We never hung out outside of class. 

He took his life in our senior year. It sucked and it hurt so deeply. I never told him, but I really admired him and was excited for his future. I still think about him frequently. I hate that the world was deprived of a genuinely awesome guy. I hate that he didn't get to live out his goals or just experience his life. 

Everyone in our class, everyone in his really close friend group went on to graduate. They went on to find love, travel, or land dream jobs. The world kept turning. 

But we all still think of him and hurt for him. Some of his friends had set up a mental health fundraiser. Some became more compassionate. 

You shouldn't aspire to make other people miserable; you should aim to leave parts of the world better than you found them. Things as small as holding the door open or as big as helping someone in a bad situation. It all counts.",0
This is a western perspective. If you really want inclusion and warmness from others you have to get out of the U.S. or europe. Game theory has ruined us all and we don't know how to be compassionate anymore because society has control of our behaviour. I spent time in Latin America and people there will take you in as if you were family the first day you meet them.,0
"I would just like to add that you never truly know how much of an impact you have had on those around you. Before covid, one of my brother’s best friends died in a car crash. I hadn’t really seen him in years or even thought about him but it’s been a year and it still hits me that he’s gone. I am sure he never knew how important his impact on my high school experience was, because to him he was just looking out for his friend’s little sister. However, even just the gesture of looking out for me and making sure the guys I was around didn’t hurt me ended up helping me get out of an actual abusive relationship later on. I really wish I had told him how much the little things he did in passing helped me feel safe and valid enough to leave that guy. 

So yes, we tend to overvalue our position in people’s lives and it can be a rude awakening to realize you aren’t as important as you think you are. But, you never know who you have helped or impacted greatly.",0
"First of all, having a bunch of people that actually care about you is, I would say, necessary for your psychological well-being. Being surrounded by your family, although I know that not everyone is lucky enough to have a nice supportive family, is a huge boost. For those who aren’t blessed with one, get yourself out there and make some friends. Don’t force anything tho. Always remember, you are awesome and you deserve some awesome friends too. Don’t expect to build a friendship with anyone, since we are all different and we can’t connect with everyone. That’s also ok. If you find hard the whole process of making friends, I know that this will sound cliche, but start a hobby, which you find interesting. That way, you surround yourself with people who actually share a common interest, a common passion with you. That worked wonders for me. Lastly, I wanna mention my opinion on your question more specifically. Whenever I think that people, the majority of them at least, don’t actually care about you, I feel a sense of freedom, relief and refreshment. Just think about it. You can do whatever the fuck you want and not expect everyone to understand, agree, disagree, support or discourage your actions. Plus, in a imaginary world where everyone cared about you and supported you in every step, you wouldn’t find those special people who would care about you in every case, like the world we live in. The last statement is based on [this video](https://youtu.be/MRJ3WfVe31U), while the rest of this essay are just things that I ended up realising during those wonderful 19 years that I’m on this planet😂. I really hope you find something useful in my words",0
Um would you REALLY care if some of those people passed away. Apart from your family and close friends probably not.,0
"In your lifetime you will really have around 5 people in your life that actually give a shit.  Like actually give a shit.  The rest are just passing through and there's nothing wrong with that. 

The older you get, the better you'll understand and not worry about it.",0
"Everybody has a life they need to take care of and that doesn't mean they don't care about you. People have tons of shit to do on a day to day basis, pay the bills, raise their children, spend time with a significant other, work on what they are passionate about, or just plain decompressing from the daily grind and if you don't align with any of those things then why would you expect people to just have to give you a call sometime?

You give a shit because this people matter to you, you don't do it to demand that affection back.",0
"I dont think it's that black and white. As some others have said it depends on the person and how strong that relationship is. For instance, I know three people(not including family) that will feel the weight of my passing for years to come, but the rest will probably feel it shortly or have a comment about it, but nothing more.",0
">A few days ago, I realized that the majority of people who I know personally wouldn't really care if I disappeared or passed away.

How did you come to this conclusion?

The least you can do is reply to those who’ve given you advice on here (which is many). 

Says a lot about you.",0
"Albert Einstein once said,

""The true value of a human being is determined primarily by the measure and sense in which he has attained liberation from the self""

We can deal with these feelings if we remember that even though we have unique lives we are also part of a larger whole. If we try to extend compassion to all living beings and to nature in general, we can achieve inner security.",0
"There will always be at least one person who cares about you more than you think. When you pass away, it doesn’t matter how large the funeral is or how many admirers you have. It’s why funerals for older individuals are smaller, most of the people they know (minus their family that’s younger and kids) have already died. But I can guarantee you that your death will severely impact someone. Whether it be your parents or close friends or maybe someone you didn’t even think would be affected. 

My dog didn’t have a funeral, and my friends didn’t care about my dog as much as I did, and most people didn’t care when she passed. It doesn’t mean that my dog was any less special. I think about her ever day and her death was one of the hardest things I’ve dealt with. It was so hard because of how much she mattered to me and how much I cared about her. My aunt also felt that people didn’t care about her, and I wish people told people how they felt before someone dies, but you should have seen how many of us were at her funeral and an absolute wreck. 

You don’t live your life for the people who don’t care. You life your life for the very few who care a lot, even if you don’t realize they do. You don’t need to feel like it’s a popularity contest. Make it count with the people who matter and when your time comes those are the people who will care.",0
"There was a point in my life when I thought the same, and thankfully I'm now at a point where I know there's, at least, a handful of person that will be at the very least moderately sad if I were to pass away...

When I thought that I was invisible/not understood,  I used it as a reason to be sad, to despair, but it took time for me to understand this is a bad time in my life and that I should keep powering through, pushing through. The situation has chanced lots since, and I will go as far as to say I have good friends 🙂

To answer your question: either ignore it, and keep living your life, or use it as a reason for you to influence and impact the world 😄",0
You're wrong. Everyone you know would care if you passed away or disappeared unexpectedly. I had a friend in college that died. Lots of people who had only talked to him once or twice were distraught.,0
Your post seems very similar to how I view things and what I want out of life. I never moved on. I'm just still looking. Maybe as I get older and into my 40s or 50s I'll begin that existential nightmare but for the moment I think I still can find that intimate understanding.,0
"I put very little stock into social interactions and have no faith in humanity. At this point, it’s literally all to just pass time between work and hobbies. Some people have bottom of the barrel expectations. Sadly, mines broke and my expectations landed on the bottom floor of Hell.",0
"Like this 🤷‍♀️

I'm joking, I'm sure this isnt true and even if most dont, some still do, right? You cant expect everyone to just lose their mind and break down because you disappeared or passed away. Like dont you want people to move on if something were to happen? Do you want them to just spend the rest of their lives wishing you were around? You should get some therapy, you sound very emotional and in all honesty a little immature. You need a different perspective.

Edit: also if youre talking about passing away from old age, you realize your life is going to change a lot by that time and people come and go out of your life, right?",0
"A few ways:

I remind myself that I don't know that. I've seen people's lives end, and many people around them whom I thought didn't know them, or didn't care about them, have their world *rocked*. 

Related to that one, I don't tell hardly any of the people I care about or who are important to me just how much I care or how important to me they are. It's likely they're all doing the same.

Being important to people doesn't add or remove any time to my life, nor any impact to the relationships I have which do have reciprocal importance/care. 

Statistically, it's been the same exact scenario for the vast majority of humans, and I have it a hell of a lot better than a good portion of them. 

I don't know whom I may grow a relationship with which will foster mutual care and importance. 

Everyone else is likely thinking the same thing. There have been billions and billions of people, all with roughly the same sort of thoughts and ideas in their head. No thought or worry any of us have is very likely to be unique at all. 

I can still build a life that means something *to me*. Find a passion and pursue it. Most people love passionate people, so, if being cared for is something you feel you need, being you, and strongly, is a great way to help foster that.",0
"I have 3 uncles and 4 aunts on my (deceased) mother's side. Besides seeing two of the aunts one time after she passed, no one made an effort to contact me at all from the time I was 10 yrs old until now. I'm 30.

It's a rare thing in life to meet someone who truly cares about you and your well being. Also not as big a deal as some might think, but rather confusing when I see people with huge families that all regularly interact and keep in contact.

Seems to be a hit or miss kind of thing.",0
I realized this and joined the military. The armed services offer compassion and camaraderie that very few other places have.,0
"Uh, most people you know do care about you.  Even people that dont would probably help you in a pinch, granted the means to help you would need to be very obvious and your situation obviously perilous.   I mean I've watched people make human chains to drag someone out of the water.  I'm sure you have done something for someone that really helped them just because you care for other mankind.   You would have a lot of people upset if you passed or disappeared.",0
"This made me smile, the fact we are so insignificant is really a breath of fresh air. I am just like those, there are very few people that could pass away in my life that I would be sad about for longer than a day. Not saying I don’t care about them but I tell ya what, when I die I sure as shit don’t want it to ruin someone’s life, drowning in despair and sadness. I want them to live their lives. I’d be honoured I touched someone’s heart enough to have them be sad about it but I wouldn’t want them to be ripped apart. 

If I make a big enough impact in someone’s life that they remember me every once in a while after I’m gone, that’s good enough for me.",0
What is there to deal with? I don't care about most people in my life either. That's just how it is. It doesn't mean anything existential.,0
"Embrace these feelings, it can only serve to make you a more well rounded individual. Understanding and accepting that you are infinitely small makes all of your lives, passions, relationships, and desires infinitely more important, because of the ephemeral nature of it all. Eat the cheesecake, pet the dog, kiss your SO, because we are small, but that’s okay. Beyond that, worrying about who would and wouldn’t care if you were gone is futile, because when the time comes I am certain, within human understanding, that you will no longer care about who thinks what and why. Chin up, pal.",0
"I used to think like this, sometimes maybe I still do. But I learned that you have to put yourself out there, you have to ask yourself, do you care as much about the others as you want for yourself? If yes, finding people like that can be difficult, but it comes back to what do you provide for them? The laughs, the moments, the hangouts, the invites, do y'all have a good time together, connect?

I needed to find a way that helped me shift my focus from instead of caring about people's health so much for example, I should shift it to enjoying my time with myself and others as much as possible whenever. It changed my perspective and made me happy overall.

A part of me shares that even if I do die and they don't remember me, that's okay. We have so much going on in our lives and the number one thing people will remember is how much you made them smile or laugh and the good moments you enjoyed together. Bonus if you did activities together like skiing or art classes, if you do hobbies together it's very likely they'll continue it after you've passed. And being human, the activity would help them remember you, hopefully bringing cheer every time they ski or draw.",0
"I mean, the fact I don't mean much is a very freeing thought. I don't have to worry that when I die, many people will be overly sad. At the sane time, it means that in my life, I can do things without worrying about posterity. 

I am an insignificant speck adrift within an indifferent universe. Any feeling of existential dread is pointless, as it won't change reality, so i might as well enjoy life.",0
"Whenever I get too big of an ego, I have to stop and remember that only about 5-6 people will really cry if I pass away.  

Most weddings and funerals are an inconvenience to most people.",0
"I partially agree with you. Last September, my girlfriend passed away. We both lived together as foreigners, and we both have different nationalities. As far as I know, just her close family got sad about this event, and probably not of her friends is nothing her disappearance. In my case, I deeply feel her loss, and it hadn't passed a day I don't think of her. 

Steven Pinker in his book ""Better Angels of Our Nature"" says, death tolls are just numbers, namely when you speak about WWI and WWII, +40M and +85M, respectively. It is difficult for us as humans to process such a big number of casualties. For the same reason, when you see a documentary explaining that something terrible happened to hundreds or thousands of people, they just develop an individual case, then they extrapolate the problem.

In my case, I know very few people will care if I die, and definitely, the show must go on, but quite sure there will be one or two that would perceive the void that your departure left. Honestly, I can live with that.

In the Nausea for Jean-Paul Sartre, the protagonist manage to overcome the fear of losing his existence in a process of writing a book because he knew that people will remember him thanks to his work. I'm far from creating a work of meaningful value, I just try to make the life of my acquaintance no so miserable. Just remember as Bob Marley said: "" Don't live to make your presence noticed, live to make your absence felt. """,0
"Counterbalance that with cherishing the people who ***do*** care about you. There's nothing wrong with having one or two really close friends and a thousand acquaintances. Life is how you make it out to be; if you don't like the idea that *everyone* you're around is just ""passing by,"" then go out of your way to slowly build up relationships with people. Coworkers, preexisting friends, family, etc.

&#x200B;

>I can usually understand people to the point where they sometimes ask me how I can read their minds, but I've never felt understood myself 

This is a great trait to have, but it definitely comes with its drawbacks; not feeling like you're getting the same respect or attention or care as you're giving out is very common with people who go above and beyond the average person, so don't feel alone.

I regularly go out of my way to help others in my community, and I ***used*** to regularly get pretty annoyed at the amount of people who didn't do the same for me. It wasn't until I grew up a bit (not sure how old you are) that I realized ***most people suck***. Obviously it's not as black and white or as harsh as that, but the average person is just that - average. *Most* people aren't going to go out of their way to help someone, and *most* people aren't going to try to build up strong relationships, as there is time, effort and risk involved in that.

I genuinely feel like a beneficial member of my community regardless of if people recognize my involvement or not, or if they reciprocate with similar emotions or actions. If someone says to you it seems like you're *reading their mind*, take that as a seriously nice compliment and move on. Don't expect the same from them. Communication isn't a strong point with most people, so the fact that someone has told you it seems like you're reading your mind is their way of saying ""thanks for understanding me,"" even if it doesn't feel like they're really saying that.

My best advice is to not expect anything. Don't expect people to act a certain way. Don't expect people to appreciate things you do. Don't expect people to do anything *for* or *with* you. Because when someone *does* do any of these things, that will be a person you can get closer with.

The people who you interact with *do* care about you (maybe not in the exact way you *expect* they care about you), but by little comments they make, they're acknowledging something positive you've done for them, which in my opinion is more than enough to feel cared for in a community.",0
"> the majority of people who I know personally wouldn't really care if I disappeared or passed away.

That doesn't sound true.

In between ""friend"" and ""person I saw at the grocery store once"", I have many acquaintances and coworkers who, if they died, I would be saddened.

I miss people from my childhood who are probably still alive. I miss coworkers who quit or were fired years ago.",0
"I once worked with a guy. I wouldn't really call us close friends, or anything more than acquaintances at any point that I knew him for. We would talk every now and then, he seemed like a decent guy. One day he stopped coming to work because he relapsed on heroin. About a week later he was found in his car, dead. I knew him for less than a year, I never met any of his family, any girlfriends or anything he might have had. I never knew what he really wanted from life, or just how much he was struggling with his addiction. But I will never forget him, for the rest of my life.

One day I'm going to die too. I'm gonna stop being part of my friends and families lives, they'll be sad for a while, then they'll get over it, eventually they'll live their lives like I never existed, and one day, I'll be completely forgotten. This is a good thing, it isn't right for me to weigh on other people's minds long after I'm dead and gone, it isn't my place to be a burden on others' thoughts at that point. When I die, I will tell those around me not to be sad for my passing, after all it won't matter to me, but to instead be happy for the life I've lived. OP I think you want to know that your life has meaning, and the only way that it can have meaning for you is for you to make your own life meaningful. Build something, be a creator, get involved in a charity, do something that you see as inherently valuable with your life, and then in the end it won't matter whether you are remembered or cared for by those around you, you'll have lived a good life in your own terms, and that's all anyone can really hope for.",0
"Maybe it would help to see some perspective from a female view. Because I suspect it may be a problem of inherent worth (because I don't care that most people don't care, but I don't think it effects my worth). And it's about maternity/paternity but I think it's relative to the worth people put into guys.  

I am pregnant and have joined a lot of groups for information they might have. And I am increasingly frustrated by the over inflation of ""women need to lift each other up"" and ""mums this"" and ""mums that"" and a lack of... well anything FOR dads or representative of dads. It pisses me off. There are so many people who do a great job of being a parent but they're treated like they just make money and nothing else. So many trashy posts come through Instagram pages for example, where they ""jokingly"" bitch about men. But it's ALL about how women are super heroes... *eyeroll*  

It's fine to have a place to have meaningful conversation and support but not when it's so one sided.  

I guess my point is that on a human level, it might seem like masculine appreciation is downplayed or non existent, but there are more people out there who do inherently appreciate you than you think they would, because that's normal and they think of it as an expected world view.",0
"The problem is that you are only half right. Will the world forget you eventually? Yes. In the 50ish years after you die? Of course not. Your kids and grand kids will definitely remember you, although they may not think of you every minute.  I share a passing though for my dad nearly every day and it's been over a decade. Don't mistake people's ability to function through loss for forgetfulness. They just can't spend their lives grieving.  Those that love you won't forget you. Close friends will drink to the good times several times a year, kids will cherish that old blanket you gave them, significant others will keep the ring on a shelf and you in their hearts.  You won't be forgotten until the people you truely hope will remember you are joining you up above.",0
"A word for this is [sonder](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sonder)

> The profound feeling of realizing that everyone, including strangers passed in the street, has a life as complex as one's own, which they are constantly living despite one's personal lack of awareness of it. 

or

> “Sonder. You are the main character—the protagonist—the star at the center of your own unfolding story. You're surrounded by your supporting cast: friends and family hanging in your immediate orbit.
> 
> Scattered a little further out, a network of acquaintances who drift in and out of contact over the years.
> 
> But there in the background, faint and out of focus, are the extras. The random passersby. Each living a life as vivid and complex as your own.

> They carry on invisibly around you, bearing the accumulated weight of their own ambitions, friends, routines, mistakes, worries, triumphs and inherited craziness.

> When your life moves on to the next scene, theirs flickers in place, wrapped in a cloud of backstory and inside jokes and characters strung together with countless other stories you'll never be able to see. That you'll never know exists.

> In which you might appear only once. As an extra sipping coffee in the background. As a blur of traffic passing on the highway. As a lighted window at dusk.”

There's no asymmetry",0
"Yes! It's not malicious indifference! it'I just indifference. Most people in general are positive about others, so for example if they'd heard that someone they knew passed away, they'd still be sad about, but it just might not be for long. So slightly positive indifference? :D",0
"And don't lament the ones who pass through.

Believe it or not there are probably people who wish *you* stuck around but you ended up being a passer through in their life without even knowing it. You are that person in someone else's book and it probably wasn't malicious on your end so it likely isn't for most the passer-bys.

Learn to appreciate the time you have with some people and let them go emotionally when they do eventually move along.

And the ones who do stick around, treat them like minted gold.",0
"Exactly. The question is worded about ""people who know you personally"" which is just so hugely vague lol. Why would I care if someone I saw in passing dies? Just push everyone into the ""i don't care about you"" category until they do something worthy of you moving them to ""i care about you"".

A healthy dose of ego. Don't be afraid to give a little, but be wary of giving more than that to anyone that won't reciprocate.",0
"This. Be kind to people. Help people. Be selfless. Reach out to people who are going through difficult times. Don’t expect anything in return. Be nice to the newbies at work and give them guidance. Don’t talk about people behind their backs. Encourage people and offer them support. Build people up and never break them down, even if you disagree with the choices they make. Life is hard. And when someone takes time out of their day to make your life even a tiny bit easier you always remember. Be that person to others. 

I’ve only met a few people that were genuinely like this and I’ll never forget any of them and always be grateful for having them in my life. 

My ex-girlfriends dad was this guy and passed away from cancer a few years ago, his funeral was fucking PACKED. Literally hundreds of people sobbing. He wasn’t rich or famous, he was just a regular guy with a heart of gold and for that he will always be remembered.",0
Buddha says: If you look the world over you find no one more deserving of love and compassion than yourself.,0
That is the effect of Active Nihilism vs. Passive Nihilism.,0
how do you not lament that you became someones passerby when you've been the one doing the reaching out,0
"> My ex-girlfriends dad was this guy and passed away from cancer a few years ago, his funeral was fucking PACKED. 

But even if it wasn't.....that's okay. 

Having 5 people who you mean a lot to, who you've helped out, and who you've been there for. People who then reciprocally have helped you out, who have shared your joy - That's what life is about.",0
"Does that mean they don't care though? People can't just sit and think about someone after they pass all the time. The world still goes on and things need done, but that doesn't mean they don't care",0
"Loss is ultimately a solitary thing, everyone can try to be there for you as much as possible but no one can help you deal with it when you're awake at 3am thinking your thoughts and feeling your feelings. When my dad died people were there for me but they have their own lives and schedules, when they had to sleep I had to really face that reality, I had to face my grief head on and I'd be lying if I said I didn't cry. Time passed, he was buried, I healed.

Whether you want to or not, you have to face it alone, it fucking sucks but you heal eventually.",0
"I don’t know if pretending it isn’t a thing counts as coping. It seems like denial/avoiding the reality. 

It’s so lovely to bring up those that have passed on and remember the things they loved or how they would have embraced a situation you’re encountering. People continue to live on through our shared memories of the impact they had on our lives.",0
"Grief hits me the hardest in the middle of the night or right in the morning. 

I think most people on a daily basis can't tell that I'm still thinking about my brother and his passing every single day, and since I have a cheery disposition, unless I tell people I'm still struggling, no one will know. I had to tell my boss explicitly that I'm still struggling to think and be as productive as I was pre-grieving. 

I also worked through dealing with my grief because I realized that suicide was not an option, so if I'm gonna keep living, at least it shouldn't be in a pit of grief despair. But not everyone in my life needs to know that. 

Fully agree with you.",0
Denial is a way of coping. It may not be healthy but it is definitely a coping mechanism. No one talks about someone who died for very long. Well I should clarify. I don’t know anyone who talks about someone who has died after about a year. After all the firsts have passed it just isn’t really discussed. My husband lives on in my heart but I don’t bring him up much. Anyway. That’s not what this thread was about. Sorry about that. Life just goes on. People are very self absorbed and do their own things.,0
"My dad passed away when I was 13 and it was kind of a surreal moment like ""he's gone and he wasn't coming back."" I was just shocked and I didn't know how to take it so I just buried it as deep as possible in my mind so I don't remember a lot of it but all I know is that he was a great father to me and loved by alot of people.",0
I have always grieved hard for any of my pets that have passed. Always will.,0
"Loss is an awful but inevitable part of life. Several pets have died in my lifetime and all of them hurt so much (some more than others where there was a particularly strong bond), but I'm so glad they were all in my life. Getting another pet will help with the grieving process (it'll be a distraction), but the biggest healing factor is always the passing of time. Don't deprive yourself of more love in your life. To quote Vision, ""What is grief if not love persevering?""",0
"As much as my pets mean to me, I remember that there are approx 1.5 million dogs and cats euthanized in the US every year. Every pet of mine that passes after living a good life means that I get to adopt another one, and that makes one more that does not have to be euthanized.",0
"Hey dude,

First of all, so sorry for your loss of your loved ones. It's hard as heck. 

I lost my 10 year old cat in December due to cancer and I had to put down my 1 year old car yesterday due to a neurological disorder that affected everything in her system this past month. 

The way I dealt with them passing:

1. Cried
2. Cried a lot
3. Watched videos and pictures of them to make me smile
4. After smiling, cried again
5. Told friends and family so they could be understanding during that time 
6. Ate comfort food
7. Made cremation appointments
8. More importantly, made (will make for the little one soon) keepsakes that can hold some of their ashes
9. Remember them and always talk about them, even when it's hard
10. Watched more videos and pictures of them. 

It's never easy when they pass. It's even less easy when you try to look for them and then remember that they're gone. 

But the thing that you have to remember is that you gave them a good life. Lots of love, cuddles, treats and endless kisses. Unfortunately, as someone else said in the thread, they're not here for our whole lifetime, but we are here for theirs. 

Hope this helps and take care of yourself.",0
"**My last request**

As my muzzle is greying

My eyesight fading

And my body weakening

I understand

That our time together

Is waning.

 

Before I go to rest

Please grant me

One last request:

When I can no longer eat

When I can no longer sleep

When even your loving tough

Starts hurting too much

Please let me go

And set me free.

 

When I am ready

To take that last journey

Stay with me until I’m free.

Say a prayer to give me peace

Stroke my body to bring me ease

Hold my paw to give me strength

Kiss my face to show me love

Close my eyes to let me sleep …

Assure me that you’ll be ok

Whisper my name

To guide me on my way.

 

And Mom, Dad

Please, please don’t cry

Know that you have given me

A wonderful, wonderful life.

"Grief is simply the love you still have to offer that animal that's no longer here physically. Grief hurts for sure, but nothing is stopping you from expressing that love you still have. Cry It out, talk to them like they are still here. Express that energy so it can make it's way back to them to receive.
I lost my best friend 5 years ago and I STILL cry for him. Even with another pup who I love with all my heart, I still cry out for my lost baby. THAT is how much love I still have for my childhood dog. My Avalanche was with me from 11yo to 27yo. He was with me thru literally everything. So why wouldn't I cry out for the coolest dog in my world? 

If you have love for another living being and you have the ability to offer them a safe home for them to grow in, then you need to recognize the love they have for you. You need to recognize how incredible you truly are to allow these other species to exist freely with you. For an animal to die near a human isn't normal for them. They only die in places they feel safe. So your animals passing away WITH you means they literally trusted and loved you so much that even in death they wanted to be near you. 

Grief comes with love.
You love these babies and they are showing you that even as they die, they love you the most. I think you're doing great and if you truly want to love these babies, you'll find your way to your next adorable furbaby. 💓💔💓",0
"In my experience, the pain and loss forever stays the same and hurts the same no matter how much time has passed. However, time absolutely does heal. The pain comes sharp and fast at first and nearly unbearable, then not quite as often, and after a while you'll realize that a quite a long time passes between memories and sadness. You then know your gratitute for your time together outweighs the pain of losing them. Then, oh then...a new friend can come in and you fall in love again, and you remember why these relationships are so amazing and important and why we love and lose our family time and again willingly. We are only here for a short while. Love while you're here, because we can't love like this in these bodies anywhere else.

Just because we lose the physical part of those we love, doesn't mean they're gone, and it doesn't mean loving isn't worth it. It's everything.",0
"That grief you feel, it is your love persevering.

I know when it's time for my golden retriever Billy to go to the rainbow bridge it will break me and I'll be unconsolable and grieving for a long time. Even thinking about it now is making me tear up.

Know you gave them the best life you could, that animal loved you and was comforted by you and your presence so much they felt they could trust you and sleep by you. 

When they pass on, a part of you which you dedicated to them passes on too. But it's your duty to remember all the quality memories you have of your beloved pets, every moment you came home to see them jumping for joy, meowing or boofing their fluffy hearts out as you come through the door, keys in hand from a hard days work. Every cold miserable day where you woken up to them by your side in bed, to have them lick your face and or hands relentlessly, to have them drooling on your lap as you eat and share a cheeseburger with them.

They love you just as much as you love them.

This is also a part of what life is, loving, losing, and learning to love again.

"I think the important thing to remember is there are many animals out there that need safe, loving homes. And the greatest way to honor our pets that passed away is to adopt others that need help.",0
The dog you got to replace your cat less than a year ago already passed away?,0
"I tell the stories I love the most and tell found memories and stories to keep their spirit alive, like my pit bull i nick named my “big ol tiddy baby” she would act like she would eat you up if you tried to come in the back yard but once you met her and we’re on good terms she would snuggle you and cover you in kisses. She was a stubborn ass dog but I loved her to death and still do it’s been a few years since she passed but retelling and thinking about the first day we met brings a smile to my face each and every time, tell your favorite stories, watch y’all’s favorite shows, and when your ready do it again and know that’s what your pet would want to do spread the love and start new memories with a new companion. Your not replacing your old pet one dog can’t and won’t replace a new one I had a lab before my pit I love them equally but these two dogs were totally different in many ways, different breeds, height, weight, colors, personality, but the one thing they had in common they loved me until their last breath and so did I.",0
"It's truly one of the deepest kind of hurt there is, I think. We lost my black lab that I'd had from when I was 3 to when I was 17, out of town visiting colleges for fall break. She truly was my everything, and she and my Yorkie were the best of friends. My sweet Yorkie passed this past July, a month before her 13th birthday (almost to the day) very unexpectedly and painfully. I say this to let you know that you are certainly not alone in this, and that you will get through the thick of the pain, slowly but surely. It's hard to remember the good times right now, but please know that it will get easier in time. You'll look back on all the happy times with fondess in your heart, and know that you got to make them happy for their whole lives. As Vision says, *""What is grief, if not love perservering?""*
 I think if you feel that you're in a place to be able to adopt another pet, that may be a good idea. You get to bring love and joy to a creature's life, and they get to do the same for you.",0
"I had a Rott-Dobe mix and I loved him to death. He was my son, my brother, my friend, everything. He passed away from anal tumours last year at an age of 9, and I can never even imagine to replace him. 

I don't know if anyone can relate with this, but for me, I will always have that one pal, and that one only. Would I replace my dad, or mom, or sister? No right? I want to remember him and not replace him with another. Just the thought of getting a new dog sounds disturbing to me. He wasn't a toy that broke, that now I need a new one to play with. He was my pal!

That's how precious his memories are to me that I cannot dilute them with my need to love something else. I have seen my friend spiral into depression after replacing 2 pets. He was utterly heartbroken when the third one passed away. 

We humans are selfish, even in the need to love inherently.",0
"When your pet dies it's not a loss. It's the opportunity to provide another animal with love.

I've lost a few dogs and cats to everything from old age to cars to cancer. What always gets me through the loss is that they got to live the happiest most love filled life possible with the time they had. And when they pass it's time for a new dog/cat to get the same opportunity.",0
"My parents didn’t want to have anymore pets after my cat, Buster, died. He had come into my parents lives on their first date and had stayed with them until my younger brother was two. It was heartwrenching to see him pass, even as a toddler who didn’t quite understand grief yet. Our other cats arrived in similar fashion by choosing us or fate choosing us, and they’re both loving cats. I miss Mr. B, but Alma is kind and loving too. Just like seeing a dear friend pass on, losing a pet hurts. A lot. And we may cry over them for a long time, but there will come a day where their memory puts a smile on your face, and you remember all the fun you had with your pet. Through you, they live on.",0
I don’t know how I’ll deal with my first love passing. She’s getting old now she will be 12 this year I know I don’t have much time left with her. I write this with tears in my eyes just thinking about my Lulu and what things will be like without her.,0
"I am in the same State, my cat got run over 2 months ago. I am still terribly sad but i like to think that he was happy until his very end. You can't change what happened, you can't get them back. Don't be sad that it is over, be happy that it happened. 

Tbh i can't really give you advice, just know that it is not forever, my other cat died 2 years ago and today, eventhough i am still sad sometimes, am ok with his passing. You will learn to accept, you will learn to remember the good Times, and eventually, you will learn love another animal just the same. You will never replace him, but you will learn to live without him.",0
In my opinion go get another pet. Save a pound puppy or cat or both. Pass on the love from your previous pets to the new ones.,0
"Im so so sorry for your loss. I feel your pain. My doggie passed away the other night. I have barely slept or eaten since then. When i do sleep, i wake up crying.    
I've never been so lonely. I don't have anyone to give me hugs and kisses before work anymore and nobody's excited to see me when i get home.    
The old saying is ""time heals all wounds"" or something like that. I really hope it holds true for your sake and mine.",0
When did your dog pass away? Your other post just says you gave him away?,0
"Time heals. I personally feels that loss of an animal leaves that specific kind of hole in your heart, it is different from loss of another human being, because animals gives us nothing but love and smile. I clean his grave and make ritual offerings in qingming festival just like I always do to my ancestors' grave, it helps me cope 😃

I lost my Bebe (cat) 3 years ago and still dreaming about him every once in a while. He was hospitalized due to kidney disease, and when the vet broke the news I literally passed out at the office and was taken to hospital. I was a fresh graduate and just started working at that moment.

Bebe was a senior cat, he was there for me when I struggle with broken home. He leave when I finally can stand on my own two feet. I always think of him as my angel, I even still have his favorite yellow bowl, I use it to store my hairties now. Remembering him always makes me sad and stronger at the same time. I always thank God for our 11 years of warmth and cuteness 😻",0
"You have to feel all that pain. Without that pain, your love for the animals would not exist. 

Love can’t exist without pain. Harmony and discord are interwoven in life. The sweet cannot be appreciated without the sour. 

Feel deeply the pain of loss, but know over time it will pass or lessen. 

It’s ok to grieve. You could choose a day to remember her, maybe on her birthday or around the day she moved on to the next life?

Sorry for your loss. :-/ Just because pain is a part of life doesn’t make it easy eh? But it is worth it. I promise! 

Stay strong and keep moving forward. Know that there will be more loss, but also more joy. The two are one. That is life! Enjoy it and don’t fear death or loss. Think on the good times.",0
Losing pets is very difficult especially if you are close to them. But it’s a fact of life. I’ve had dogs that I e lives so much that it took weeks to get over when they passed away but time does heal. I try not to replace them right away as some sort of respect to how much they meant to me. And I never get the same breed on the next one either. I do not want to diminish how much ol sparky meant to me by getting a clone. But I know people who do that and it helps them cope. Just keep in mind that you gave  them the best life. They experienced true love from you. You both were always there for each other and they will always be remembered. Yes it hurts but it’s life.,0
"It feels like losing a family member because you are losing a family member, the animals we choose to spend our lives with can be just as important to us as people. I work at a equine rescue ranch and sometimes we get animals in that have conditions they simply cant recover from and years later they will pass away and its always very very hard. How i get through losing animals is first; mourning. Its important to feel that grief but not let it consume you. Know that the animal you had lived whatever part of its life it had with you feeling loved, cared for and protected. Your cat sounds like it had an amazing and loving home that they wouldnt have traded for anything and even though they arent here anymore the memories and love is still there. Its also important to know that getting another animal dosnt have to be “replacing” another, i would highly recommend rescuing the next animal you get. Knowing you gave them a second chance at life and knowing they lived the best life possible once you got them is what gets me through losing my animals from dogs to horses.",0
You are focused on the wrong thing. I am a grown man who rarely cries. I bawled when a had to put down my Shadow. But the truth is we saved each other I gave him a warm loving home when he was returned 3 times from the shelter I got him. He gave me love and companionship I will take with me the rest of my life.  Save a pets life by adopting from a shelter. the pain you feel when they pass is nothing compared to the joy in sharing their life.,0
My pets are the only children I will ever have. When they pass away it is brutally painful for me but I know that I gave them the best life possible and they loved me as much as I loved them. Doesn’t stop me from getting another furball in need of love later.,0
"My wife (with my support) created a shrine to our lost dog (I only knew her for a year-ish but she had her for ~10 years... passing at nearly 13.5yo) She was one of the first dogs I loved and even at 13 was like a kid knocking over stuff all around the house. Your sentiment is very accurate. The phrase ""time heals all wounds"" doesn't have a duration so... it wasn't a night or two ago where my wife broke into tears about the loss that was a month or more ago. I'd gladly give you a hug  and a shoulder to cry on if we were actually face-to-face.

I don't have additional  specific advice but to relate it to humans (e.g. relatives) sometimes you have to cry yourself to sleep many times until you've exhausted yourself so you can move on.",0
"Grief is natural. All that love you had for them unfortunately hurts. I lost my childhood pet nearly a decade ago and I still miss him like crazy. Myself and my partner lost our cat about 7 months ago and I still get mixed up because I sometimes hear his gentle meows. It will hurt I'm afraid and always will, that is the price of love. 

The thing that keeps me going is, to have had them in my life as I did I will hold the burden because I gave them the best life I could and they gave me the best they could and to have had them is better to have not.

Edit; I should clarify, lost as in they passed away.",0
"I'm having nearly the exact experience as you, OP. This Friday will mark one year from the date I had to say goodbye to my big orange cat George, who was just a month shy of his 13th birthday. He was diabetic but well-controlled and otherwise healthy, but one Monday morning I awoke to him seizing on the living room floor. He passed away at the clinic three days later. My vet thinks George somehow ingested some sort of rodenticide.

With this dark anniversary just around the corner, a lot of the grief and sadness has come flooding back. I still weep from time to time about losing him, especially so suddenly. I'd had him since he was just 7 weeks old. He was with me through graduate school, a long and frustrating job search, and so many other rough patches. I know I'll never not think about or miss him. I know with time the pain will ease, but I doubt it will ever be completely gone. I guess that's just the inevitable consequence of opening my heart to him and loving him for all the wonderful years I did have with him.

Take care, man.",0
"My family has had 4 dogs in the home through out our lives. 3 have passed, while the 4th one is still very young. It sucks everytime when they pass, but the 13+ years of joy and love from those precious little fur balls is worth it every time.",0
"I don't like to say ""deal with"" like grief is the dishes I'm too big a man to be bothered to do. ""How do I mourn my best friend"" is like, the oldest question we have. The best advice I can give is to let yourself grieve, let yourself cry and feel miserable. There's no way to bypass grief.  **There is no way to bypass grief**. **Take care of yourself while you grieve.** Keep showering and getting dressed in the morning like today is important. Eat good food and make time with your friends. Play, and if you have a partner be a good partner back. As long as there has every been anything, and everything that has ever been, has ended or will end. The only thing you can do is savor them while it's here- and while you're here. It sounds like you really did that with yours. Keep saying goodbye, it's like a cold. There isn't a medicine for it, you just have to treat the symptoms and take better care of yourself while you go through it. When you're ready, if having pets is something you love, there are other animals waiting to be loved the way you loved yours.",0
"The joy they bring day in and day out for (hopefully)years is worth it. In my opinion. It's fucking hard when they go, I had to put 3 down in one year. But time is a good healer and I've found the time it takes to move on from their passing is much less than the time you're with them.",0
"Most animals don’t live as long as us. That’s just a fact of anything. One day my cats are going to pass away, and I can’t do anything about that. I don’t think I’m sad about it though. The animals we let into our homes live their full lives and die peacefully. Caring for them during that time is something that gives me great meaning. I guess my message would be complete acceptance of what is. The sadness will come. We have no control over that. It can come from any part of our lives at any time. Trying to control when and where it comes from will only increase it.",0
"when my 12 year old bird passed away I didn't got sad neither grieved, death is also part of life so I just buried it and moved on like nothing happened. I don't know it's probably because I'm heartless I never get sad over death or things I cannot change",0
"Don't even need to be there for their entire lives.  I adopted my most recent cats when they were already old.  Made my home their retirement home for their last couple years.  Their passings were fucking rough on me, but I'm glad I could at least make their last years happy.",0
"This made it worse for me when I first read it years ago, knowing I wasn't able to take him for regular walks. He was my childhood dog, my best buddy of 13 years.

Got a new dog only 5 years after he passed away, still couldn't call my new dogs the same nickname I gave him. I still talk to him, saying he's still my best buddy and I miss him terribly. I still am afraid to look at the few pictures I got him when he was still with me.

Edit: getting a new dog actually made me a more responsible owner. Taking them for more walks and stuff.",0
My 6 months old cat passed away recently and I'm so heartbroken. Thank you for this comment,0
"My last pet passing, I had to call in sick to work that night as I knew I wouldn't be able to be a good nurse that night. The next night, I worked and it was fine. 

Some ppl think that's too much, but I too, grieve hard.",0
"Agreed. It’s totally ok to grieve for our pets. They are part of the family. 

My 13 year old dog passed away last year and i cried for days. Took a small gateway vacation and then got a kitty about 2 months after. Fell in love. She suddenly passed away last month and I cried for a week straight (she wasn’t the healthiest cat to begin with though). Time helps.

I definitely understand the feeling of wanting a pet, but also scared because you just had someone so dear to you and don’t want to replace them. And you don’t. You just provide a loving home to another animal. I’m taking some time before getting another animal though.",0
"Parrots leave a particular wound on your soul in my opinion. They’re just ... unique. Kind of like how no 2 humans are the same no matter how similar they are. Parrots have these eccentricities and quirks that just feel irreplaceable. When my 9 year old cockatiel passed, I would weep thinking of how he would imitate my cats meows or refuse to come down from the chandelier at night. Another baby parrotlet I had died unexpectedly after only 2 weeks but our bond was strong enough to have me in grief for weeks. Birds are immensely beautiful creatures, they really leave a mark on your heart and I feel your pain ❤️",0
As someone who's dog of 10 years passed 3 months ago I feel like it's too soon for me to get another one as I'd be looking for my old dog in the new one. Not healthy for me nor fair for the new dog,0
"Has there been a connection?

With me and my pets, i would talk to them (they would meow back or bark back. To tell what they said, soft tone = want, loud tone = excited. 

The last day my cat lived, she stared at me.. and stared. Looked at me. For 2 HOURS STRAIGHT. I tried not looking at her, but she stared at me.

The next day she passed away. She was trying to tell me that she was not gonna live much longer. And that, to me, just because they can’t communicate, doesn’t mean they are robots. They just need to be discovered and treated, similar to how a hurt human can be blossomed into a blooming flower.",0
Idk what I’ll do when my cats pass away. They’re turning 5 next month and I still feel like my little kittens that bite my toes for attention. The only thing I can think of is commissioning someone to make little statues of them that I can put their ashes in when the time comes. There’s not a second that their not right next to me when I’m at home.,0
"Too much? If anything, your hard work shows in the fact that you returned to your job just 1 day after the passing of a loved one.",0
Cardiac hemangiosarcomas are the worst. We lost our Myla very suddenly to one. She was fine and then one day couldn’t walk without collapsing. She was only 9. Very sad.,0
Id be happy passing on once my dick stops working,0
"I expect it to be less a place of comfortable with passing on and more one of ""uncomfortable with living"". 

There's always more to do, but there will come a point where I can do little of it and, unless I'm lucky, a point where I become a burden on others. At that point I can't see myself wanting to keep going.",0
"Depends. If you’re in the passing lane you need to move over. If you’re in the right lane do nothing. If I’m cruising around town on a small two lane road doing the speed limit or 5 over I get petty and just downshift and keep slowing down until they back off or pass lol

Btw as a side note, as a driver in the US, no one (and apparently a few in this thread) knows how to use lanes correctly. The left lane isn’t a “fast lane” it is a PASSING lane. After you pass a car move the fuck back over so faster traffic can pass you. In my state riding in the left lane is a traffic violation, although apparently rarely enforced lol",0
Let em pass they are pig bait,0
"I recently sold my sports car and got a van. I no longer try to be out front because the van doesn't drive fast very well. And soon I realized I'm thrilled not to be in front anymore.

I actually let everybody else pass me on purpose sometimes I even pull over to let them pass but the freedom of not being at the front of the pack is unbelievably liberating.

Try it sometime, you may never go back to driving fast.",0
"Last night I had some goon tailgating me. He was so close my back-up sensor alarms were going off. We pulled away from a red light and he maintained about a foot of distance between him and I for a quarter mile while we be were accelerating/cruising. I pulled over to let him pass.

When I pulled over, someone was turning onto the roadway ahead of me and didn't expect some idiot to come flying around me and they ended up cutting him off. He then tailgated them up to about 10mph over the limit.

Just let them pass if you safely can. It isn't worth the stress headache you get from being angry combined with staring into your rear-view.",0
"I tailgate people (confession time). It has nothing to do with roadrage 99.995% of the time. It's because there is open road ahead, and they are preventing me from reaching it. But most of the time they are a. camping in the left lane, b. running neck and neck with another car making it impossible to pass, or c. going slower than the reasonable flow of traffic. I don't care how fast you want to go, just as long as you're not obstructing my path. On the flip side, I rarely get tailgated any more. That's because I am a. constantly watching my mirrors, especially the rearview, b. aware of gaps in the road and get over to fill them, and c. running with the fastest traffic. If someone is tailgating me, it is typically impossible for them to pass or go faster regardless of what they do because I am going as fast as that moment allows. A final thing, at least with my vehicle, is curves. Nothing brings me greater joy than watching someone who was tailgating me fall back because they can't hang with me. If I don't feel like getting over, I'll just outdrive them.",0
If its a normal road 55 under if im doing five over ill gradually slow to the exact limit and ill let em pass me if they want to if im on the interstate 60 up ill move over so they can pass me.,0
"I get out of the way, if I can't, I tap the brakes a couple times so the lights light up without me slowing down to let them know that I don't like that. If they don't respond then I will gradually slow down to make it easier for them to pass. I did call the police on an officer who was doing it to me for about 10 miles. He could have safely passed sooooo many times! I really wanted to jam the brakes on but I would never do that because I'm not going to let my anger crash a car. This is probably going to piss a lot of people off and I don't do it anymore..... But I learned to drive as a very stoned teenager and I've always followed the traffic laws as strictly as I could to avoid any attention so I can just get where I was going and not crash or get pulled over. When I hear people talking about being badasses on the road I point out that the whole point of driving is to get where you're going ""Why would you mess with someone in any way""",0
That pisses me off so bad lol. I normally start slowing way way down until it forces them to pass. One time I got all the way down to 30 in a 55 before the guy passed me lol.,0
"I usually just hit the brakes,  I couldn't give a fuck if they hit me. In my country, you're automatically at fault if you hit someone in the rear and my cars a company vehicle so they'll just get me another one. Funny enough, never been hit, but I've caused two tailgaters to crash by doing this, and another who had failed to strap her kids in had them all hurtle into the front with her. The last one was a cunt with two dolled up blondes in an Audi 4×4. His wagon was a few years old but he thought he was the dogs bollocks and was really doing his best to impress these women, flashing the lights etc. I could see the women laughing and he looking all smug. Well I done my thing, suddenly the 3 of them looked horrified as he stood on his brakes. The lassie in the back had been between the seats, so she came flying into the front. He swerved about me as I took off again and as I pulled away he done a mad fishtail and almost flipped. It was very enjoyable. Fuck them. 

By the way ordinarily I do let them pass, but the really aggressive ones? Nah, they get the brakes.",0
"Drive exactly 100% of the speed limit and not give a f\*\*k (unless I'm hogging the left lane which I usually don't do). Let them try and pass me if they really want to drive faster than the speed limit, not my problem.

I'm a fire fighter. I have seen the results of enough car crashes to know better.",0
"This can definitely be stressful.  I typically ensure I'm in the non-passing lane and then simply flick on cruise control so I don't find myself unconsciously going faster.  Eventually if they are consciously tailgating they'll realize they'll need to pass you if they want to go faster -- problem solved.  OR, they actually didn't realize they were tailgating you, that's just what they perceive to be a normal following distance.  Ergo, they're not actually tailgating you they're just not great drivers -- problem solved.",0
"I don't worry about them, I just keep cruising along at the speed I've been maintaining. If they want to go faster then me then can wait for a passing zone and do what they want to.",0
"Sounds like a good way to make a potential road rager go insane. I’d recommend either just drive whatever speed you were doing, or pull over so they can pass.",0
"when multiple people walk slowly and take up most of the sidewalk. all i want to do is pass them by as quickly as possible. sometimes i can do this without a problem, but other times i've had people react as if i was trying to mug them or something.",0
"Right now, dipsh\*ts who refuse to wear a mask, who stand too close, etc.

People who drive in the left lane and absolutely refuse to move to the right like they're suppose to.  Or worse yet, have the cruise control set but their not passing the vehicle beside them thus blocking traffic.  Years ago, some kids did that on the interstate I was on.  for like 10 or more miles, just sat in the left lane beside the tractor-trailer in the right.  A few dozen cars behind them.  When they finally did move to the right and cars were passing them, they were pointing and LOL'ing at the cars as they passed.  There are people that will shoot them for that shit in some states.

People, usually older women, who wait until everything from their cart is rung up.  Then, when told the total, they start to dig their checkbook out, nice and neatly write the check out, THEN record it in the ledger, and so on while they're people waiting behind them.  Get a damn debit card like the rest of us FFS.

And building on the last point, when you're in a hurry but get held up somewhere and people act like holding you up isn't a big deal.  Yea, I may not be racing to save someone's life but F you you condescending bitch.  Like I went to attend a mountain bike festival I had been looking forward too.  A couple cars ahead but no big deal.  Well, this woman just kept talking and talking to the guy in the van in front of me.  After a few minutes of waiting, I decided to go around.  Plenty of room to do so.  No harm to anyone.  I just want to get signed in so I can put up camp and hit the trails.  As I start, I  hear her yelling: ""WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!!!""  I ask her what?  She said I couldn't do that and stood in the way of my car.  I'm pissed because they the fuck NOT!?!?  She's then going all condescendingly:  Just chill dude!  Chill! Not a big deal, chill.  I was thinking:  This is my stomping grounds. YOU'RE the outta towner here.  And you're holding everyone up!",0

If you arent actively passing another vehicle. get out of the lane and move right.,0
"Mixed.

It won't be a popular opinion but they do better at some roles then others. 

When I was in the CF they had a physical test for the men and a different one for the women (not sure if its still like this), this was for people all doing the same job. In terms of front line combat roles if they can pass the same physical tests as the men I have no issue with it though. But giving certain people a free pass on standards just puts the lives of everyone else in the unit in danger. 

I also saw some of them get a free pass in other areas like weapons handling drills and marksmanship, that absolutely will get people killed. I assume this was because the higher ups were afraid to rock the boat given their gender but I can't say that for certain. I just know the NCO's would look frustrated repeating drills with them over and over but would pass them regardless. For context this was somewhere around 15 years ago.

If they pass the same identical standards as men with no slack at all, no problem. If not the military needs to be able to wash them out like anyone else. Also for pilots and stuff like that I have no issue at all.",0
"I don't understand why women-only combat units haven't even been proposed.

I guess (US perspective here) ""separate but equal"" has nasty historical connotations, but in sports we segregate the sexes and few people any beef with that.  And if any human endeavor mimics sports, it's war (actually I guess it's sports that mimic war...).

All-women units would eliminate at a stroke most of the complaints and dire predictions of those who advocate against women in combat.  You won't have to worry about men being chivalrous and making bad decisions to protect female soldiers.  Nobody can get pregnant.  If they have to rescue each other, they are closer to the same size.  The training can be optimized to women's physiology to prevent stress injuries.  Their gear loadout can be similarly optimized for their weight-carrying capacity (I wouldn't be surprised if they figure out a different weight distribution across the body works better for women's bodies).

History has ample examples of all-women fighting units kicking ass and taking names.  Are there people back home expecting them to fail?  Good!  It will only drive them to train and fight harder to prove the bigots wrong.  When they succeed, nobody can say the men did it despite being burdened by the women - there can be no doubt it was all the women who did that shit.  If they are fighting an enemy who can't be trusted to treat prisoners decently, women have an extra layer of concerns about being taken prisoner.  Against that enemy, watch them fight like demons from hell to win.

I'm skeptical about integrated combat units, because that's experimental and I don't like the idea of playing games with people's lives when they are already volunteering to go into danger.  All-women units, however, I don't have a problem with it.  Because although it's somewhat experimental, it would be an experiment that everyone involved will have volunteered to be a part of.  And the fact that they have something to prove is likely to make them more effective, not less.

And all-women units could be a proving ground for women in combat, and that could be a good stepping-stone to integrated units, if anyone still wants them.",0
Whatever happened to the 2(?) Women who passed Ranger school? Did they ever see combat? And if so did they kick ass?,0
"From my experiences its about an 80/20 split. 20% of women I worked with when i was in the military were fine, they had no problem showing up, doing their job, and generally pulled their own weight. 

The other 80% were an endless source of drama and headaches and were consistently unable or unwilling to put in the effort to help the shop or actively dragged us down with bullshit and we would have been better off not having them at all.",0
"I don't see an issue.   
A child with a gun can kill just as easily as a woman or man. If they're grown ass adults and can pass the physical tests then there's no reason for the discrimination.",0
"The Israelis had it right decades ago. Servicewomen must be present in combat in women-only platoons, and never in front line duty. Women can fulfill a useful role as auxiliaries holding positions on targets already secured, or as REMFs. They can also serve in any role by air or by sea where they can pass the same strict examination as men. 

A less strenuous PT requirement would then be permissible, as it already is for a lot of armed forces. 

What's I've noticed is that in cultures with a longer history of volunteer-only standing forces, like in Anglo countries, there is a fixation feminists have on esprit de corps, because military institutions are the single example of masculinity where no woman can enter without spoiling the whole institution. Yet the pageantry and cult of valour is too irresistible. Hence why the more recent schism in sexual politics has been to neuter everything.",0
"I think the concern is the military may give them a free pass in certain areas to meet certain quota standards and be afraid to wash them out due to potential political backlash. This actually happened in the Canadian Forces.

If that happens its not doing anyone any favors including the women enlisting since they are not meeting certain standards which were set for a reason. And the consequences for not meeting them can be rather dire during an actual conflict.

But yes if the pass or fail on the same standards as everyone else I have absolutely no issue.",0
"Why not just create a two tiered system - one with the current or higher pt requirements, and another with lower requirements for non combat roles?  Anyone can join either force,  but they simply must meet the requirement.  That way there's no weakening of standards, and you may even get more recruits passing the tests due to more people being able to pass the lower standard.",0
"Well ours have been passing with the same requirements for half a century now. Looks like it only turns into an issue if the military is sexist in its training, which defeats the entire purpose of training them like you said.",0
"That's effectively how virtually all modern militaries already operate. It leads to resentment because lower requirements still doesn't get enough extra female recruits, yet there are very sensible reasons for keeping them in separate quarters. There also isn't a twin rank structure, which would be self-defeating, so a lot of men I used to work with absolutely detested women NCOs and junior officers, and they more often than not were promoted just to look good on paper for all the civil servants to pass on in a memo to the secretary of defense. It harms the integrity of the whole force, but politics doesn't care. 

Now if we did have a Starship Troopers scenario of co-ed facilities and higher requirements to entry that most men couldn't even pass, that at least gave recruits enough emotional support and opportunities to return to civilian life without any societal guilt, then we'd be onto something.",0
"I agree with you. My only counter thought is doesn’t it come down to the military chain of command? 

You have rankings in every platoon/division. Hypothetically if your front line/high ranking guys who passed the more strenuous PT tests all get taken out, and you’re in a lower level (even as admin or whatever) you’re the next highest rank until support comes. You then have to lead those below you. While you have a PT assessment to pass, it’s not to the level your higher ranking have to meet. I wonder, could that PT differentiation end up being very important in an extreme situation?",0
"Service members have a natural instinct to protect eachother. Regardless of race, color, creed, gender, waist size, preference of coffee color, etc. 

The idea that a leader will throw down his life because ""she's a woman"" over throwing down his life for some other squad mate is an asinine and childish view that only someone who hasn't ever had to lead a combat unit would argue. 

And believe it or not, there are plenty of men who don't make it through basic infsntry training as well. Plenty of 5'2 110lbs can't-hack-its who sign up for the infantry only to suffer skeletal injuries or the inability to buddy drag their 200lb squad made. 

The physical standards are there to weed out anybody who can't handle it, male or female. So as long as we don't move the physical fitness standards, I say we let em all in and whoever passes gets to join, regardless of gender.",0
"I am not obfuscating their role. Because of the actual history behind it I just do not want to use Soviet WW2 recruiting standards as a template.

If women can meet exactly the same standards on a pass or fail test that the men can I have no issue with it. If they can't pass the same tests then they don't belong there same as any men who would fail.",0
"I get what you're saying, and you have a really valid point about the almost erasure of gender roles in our society today. 

However, what I am saying is that the role of attraction or love between a male and female impacting combat readiness, would probably be a lot lower than we think. I think this for two reasons;
1) If sexual attraction was a key factor, we would see units be adversely affected by having gay service members. If you argue against having women in combat arms for the sake of 'romance' (we can call it that to keep it simple) then shouldn't we also be worried about same sex romance impacting the unit? - this is a wild stab here, but I imagine the percentage of women that could pass the physical screening would be similar to the amount of gay men who are already in these units, pretty low -

So I think we are over selling that point or the argument. 

2) PTSD is a significant cause of veteran suicide, and a leading cause of PTSD is the ""learning about the violent or accidental death of a loved one"". ([this was hasty Google research, don't hate](http://Learning about the violent or accidental death or injury of a loved

Read more: https://militarybenefits.info/ptsd/#ixzz6nak7Ut2S)

Based off of that, we can see that the amount of love servicemembers have for eachother is staggering, so much so that they literally kill themselves over losing one another. How many men do you know that kill themselves because they lost a spouse or girlfriend?  About 1% ([again, more hasty research, I'm on my phone so...])(https://consumer.healthday.com/mental-health-information-25/depression-news-176/young-widowers-at-high-suicide-risk-509039.html) veterans commit suicide due to PTSD at a much higher rate than that. 

So I think we are downplaying the amount of love service members already have for eschother. 


Tldr: inter-service relations matter way less than we think, and the bond between servicemembers already matters way more than we think. 

Either way, it's nice to have a discussion with people on the internet who aren't fucking idiots, so thanks.",0

You cant ""fix"" a partner, don't try to build a relationship where you need to fix them.


Relationships should be partnerships. Support with the work, support with all the emotional baggage. Basically, your partner should be you number 1 cheer leader.


Don't waste time on bad relationships, life's too short. 


Don't use too much makeup, let it accentuate your natural beauty.


Drink lots water.


Work out regularly for your health.


Remember to call your mother. Try to record a conversation with her, maybe one about your dad, or her as a kid or her parents. Try to get a recording of her laugh. Save these in multiple safe places. 


Remember to take deep breaths when stressed, and focus on what you can do in that moment, not all the other things.

"I’m 21,

But I can pass to you what I’ve learnt from my experience so far.

Ps: My father was absent for the most part of my life so far we picked back up our relationship when I was already “formed” for lack of a better word.

• Never take out a loan against anything that’s not a “investment”, for example taking out a car loan for an A to B car is fine as it will allow you to get to work and earn more in the long run but I actually worked with a guy who thought it was okay to take a loan out to go on a holiday and buy a new PlayStation.

• Learn basic nutrition, do your check ups with the doctor or see a nutritionist your health is your wealth and no investment spent on it is useless, I found out I have a genetic iron processing disorder through this, which would’ve caused trouble in my older years.

• Learn some basic philosophy, it’s a good cure for Nihilism which is the dominant thought at the moment. Nietzsche lived a mediocre pessimistic life but he’s a good read to understand the prevailing subconscious of western society. 

• Learn basic politics read the communist manifesto, Moustache guy politics and free market liberalism should have you 90% more equipped than most of reddit.

• Understand the hidden sub context in life , “Why does he want me to do this?”  this is a good skill that’s kept me out of trouble, and it’s like a knife you sharpen I’m not saying be paranoid but hone your intuition.

• Pay notice to people’s body language, I worked in meat grinder sales for 1.5 years.

A smile ear to ear without movement in the eyes is usually coming from a Machiavellian motivation, genuine smiles and laughter engages the eyes and you would see more teeth.

People turn their feet towards the people they like or trust most, and easy way to make someone comfortable is to look them up from the feet to the head.

The first one to speak always loses in a negotiation.

In an interview back straight with your hands on each thigh or closed fist together with wide legs.

Look people in the eye and look away every few seconds so they don’t think your a psycho.

• Never give a bad handshake.

• Cliche, but don’t be a consumer, hold on to things for as long as you can and enjoy things you used to have don’t always move to the next product iPhones for example I’ve been an Apple user for 4 years I’ve only had 2 iPhones and they release one every year or quarter I have a 7 and I think we are on 11. I have  pairs of trainers a few times and then use them as gym/running shoes before tossing them, only toss a trainer that has holes in it you paid $50+ for them.

• Watch what you say in 2020 the thought police is out in full force and they are undercover and patrolling constantly , I can’t even make jokes which I usually do in my writing because this would be removed I’ve banned from more subreddits than I can count for lewd language don’t be me. **More Importantly** *you can’t go in to work with toilet talk anymore or you are asking for a 1 way ticket to the HR office.*

• Don’t do class A drugs, no excuse.

• Limit alcohol consumption, your asking for nutrient deficiency’s, low testosterone and a small wallet. Alcohol isn’t manly it’s “consoomer”

• Be careful of the modern “energy vampires” which are E-Thots, Porn, gaming, social media, advertisers, salesmen, politicians, modern religions they all want 5 minutes of your time and your money you don’t need them no matter how much they spiel on about benefits.

• Find a hobby and get good at it.

• Do a basic fitness test if you can’t run 4K and do 10 push-ups you are very unfit, start by running and or going to the gym.

• Caffeine is a false economy it makes you worse over time and most people drink to much, it depletes nutrients and a large percentage of people are genetically sensitive. Sleep and water are better energy alternatives.

• Be an asshole with money, it’s yours and unless someone really needs it hand it out, remember that father I mentioned? I ended up paying a lot for him and realised this rule the hard way. Now I’m Mr.Krabs incarnate.

• Learn basic maintenance, how to use a hammer, screwdriver, drill etc.. and the safety behind it I once seen guys welding without using a visor because he thought squinting would work, ever get welders flash?

• If you take on any job spread out let them know how much knowledge you have in different areas “diversify” you are more employable in a recession, during lay offs etc.. but as a counter point don’t be a corporate slave respect yourself.

• Understand hierarchy’s and how to Identify who’s in charge and who thinks they are,  very important rule.

• If you want to know anything read a book on it, YouTube videos and Articles are usually far away from the actual theory/advice/knowledge and you are reading from 3rd person. Chinese whispers and that.

Put in your experience. Put in the moments when you loved your kids. Their high points and how awesome you felt about them when they got that science award, or won at soccer...or hell, my son blocked the ball with his chest on purpose and he is six. That moment I saw him make the decision  to take that flying shot to the chest and leap forward eyes closed, fists flailing backward instead of cringing into a ball...was a moment where I am proud of him. Proud of him for taking a little pain for the prize. I asked him afterwards if it hurt. And he said ""yes, but it was the right thing to do

There's a lot of stuff you can fix with your hands with some basic knowledge and once you fix a few things you start getting an idea of how other stuff works.

I've built and worked on a number of things over the years and I pull my two boys in to help me with it. Even if they're kind of bored at least if they see how it's done and maybe it'll stick in their mind so later on when they're faced with that challenge they have some ideas.  

My dad passed away when I was 19 and it taught me that even though life is short it can be shorter. Get after it.  it also shaped me as an adult on how I want to parent my kids.   my dad had his struggles with substance abuse and alcoholism my entire life so he was kind of checked out.

Honestly I wouldn't change my past because it taught me how to appreciate things as an adult. I think it also helped me be a better father to my kids cuz I'm giving them the person I wanted when I was young.

"This is advice from a peer rather than dad advice, but I hope it helps. My dad passed when I was 12. I’m 30 now. 
Don’t let the men in your life govern how you live/what you do with your time. Do what YOU want to do, not what makes them happy. If they love and respect you, they should want you to pursue your ambitions in your own way.
Your mom, if you have a good relationship, can be your best friend and closest ally.
Your 20s are about field testing everything you’ve learned about life so far. Use them to seek and experiment with whatever life you think you will enjoy. Expect some failure. It’ll suck, but it’s important to learn what doesn’t work. The more research you do ahead of time, the more catastrophic failure you can avoid.
Go to the dentist regularly. If you eat well and have good family health history you can probably skip a few check ups with your GP, but don’t skimp on the dentist.

I was always interested in art. Coming from a solidly blue collar family, most folks would think it hard to get encouragement.. but I got a ton.

My dad said ‘if you truly love what you do, you’ll feel as though you won the lottery...
And you’ll spend more hours at your job then you will with your family, so for gods sake don’t waste it on something you are indifferent about...
You have a talent, so look at the world of art, design etc... and think... where can I make the biggest and best contribution... where can I fit in...Don’t try and chase the money... money will be the by product of your passion and hard work... so make the work the priority.

My dad (retired now) was an electrician... and he LOVED being an electrician... so he wanted me to have that same feeling...

8 hours a day is a long time to hate what you do... and working for the weekend is a shitty way to go through life.

Best advice he ever gave me. And he gave me a lot a awesome advice.

Best. Dad. Ever.",0
"I lost both of my parents when I was in my very early 20s. Was closer to my father by a long shot than my mother but it wasn't by much.

I try to think back to what I honestly learned from them. To be honest the time for the things you truly learn, good and bad, and have them shape you has probably long passed. 

Still I'll try with some things I learned from my father.


Always make sure when driving that you never stop your vehicle so close to the vehicle infront of you that you can't see their back tires. This gives you room to get out if you need to.

Always keep a panty of foodstuffs you use the most and things you can make a couple quick non perishable meals. For example if I use ketchup pretty often I keep a spare bottle in the pantry. Once I use the one I have in the fridge I open the new one and put it on the list. I also keep things like canned corn, rice, canned beans, canned mushrooms, just odds and ends for filling out meals or to whip something up fast when you've had a hard day and just need to eat. 

Hate is not the opposite of Love. Apathy is the opposite of Love. Never allow someone to have so much control over your emotions and you as to hate them. If you have hate for someone you need to self reflect and ask why they're so important to you. If you don't have a good answer it's time to let your hate and let them go.

The most important thing I learned from my father, which I cannot say without sounding cliche so I'm not going to try that hard, is to always remember we're all human. 

Our life in this world is extremely brief, don't let things like hate ruin the time you have. Do your best to empathize, treat each other not with ""respect"" but empathy. To really respect someone there's something about them you need to be able to connect with at some level. However even the people who have different political beliefs, religious beliefs, cultural beliefs or anything inbetween deserve your empathy too.

That's not to say you must subject yourself to toxicity, infact you need to be responsible for taking that out of your life. Still, this world would be a much better place if we could understand each other and genuinely want in our hearts for us all to live healthy and happy lives.

Good luck",0

"I'm not a dad, yet. I hope that I will be soon. But there are two things that I'm looking forward to sharing with them, and you if you will accept it. First, don't equate your purpose with goal-based achievements. The universe isn't interested in your achievements, just your heart. Act out of kindness, compassion, and love. Second, I'm proud of you. Always.",0
"Value yourself. Always treat yourself as the precious, valuable, worthy person you are and never accept anything less from anyone in your life. You are unique, and you are loved. Remember this every day. 

I have a daughter your age, and she is loved beyond measure, as are you. Love does not expire. It is a tangible thing. You can feel it and, even if the feeling is distant, it stays with you for your entire life.  One more thing...  Pass it on and that love will continue forever.",0
"Fatherly advice applies to every child regardless of gender:

- Be nice to people.
- In spite of anything, always remain positive
- It is easy to be compassionate when you come from a place of humility.
- Everyone matters.
- Respect your elders.
- Good things take time.
- Don't be so naive.
- Know when to break the rules.
- Think of the weak, and the vulnerable, and the helpless.
- Not everyone has had the advantages you've had.
- Being ""good"" and staying ""wholesome"" is very difficult in a world of cynicism, so you always have to keep your mind and negative feelings in check.
- You are responsible for becoming more ethical than the society you grew up in.
- Boy Scout Code: Be Ready (or Prepared) for the unexpected and the not-so-likely, even if it isn't likely.
- Eat right. Save your money. Keep all your important documents in one place. Exercise and have fun with your life.

"I have two young daughters so this hit me hard. I am thinking  what I would like them to know if I were to pass away. I am not much of a writer so it’s probably going to be confusing and chaotic but I’ll try. 

Remember that you are a product of love. You don’t owe anyone anything and you’re OK the way you are. You are not defined by your successes or failures. You are a gift to this world. And so is everybody else. Give everyone a chance. 

Also, I believe there is no objective right or wrong that anyone can impose on you. Don’t ever let somebody else’s belief system override your conscience. And don’t do that to others either. 

Everything you do has consequences but they aren’t magically fair. You’ll never know the full picture. Don’t let bad luck make you stop believing and don’t let good luck make you haughty. Keep learning. 

Finally, there’s no magical perfect soulmate for you. Relationships are hard work. It’s up to you to decide who is worth your investment in them and what kind of investment. If you want to be alone, that’s ok too. You’re not defined by your mate. And they make their own choices. Sometimes you’ll do everything right and it still won’t work. Remember that your first relationship is with yourself. Invest in that one first and foremost. 

You’ll be fine.",0
"Follow your passion. If you are passionate about something enough the money will follow. Get into meditation, specifically from Sam Harris. Check out his app Waking Up. Meditation will teach you to be mindful and happy in general. When you are unhappy in a relationship get out, don’t waste years of your life. Be careful with too much partying...some of the hard drugs can rewire your brain forever. Care about your health and cherish it. Don’t be so materialistic. Things don’t buy happiness. Rather spend your money on experiences with people you care about. Learn about investing and plan for retirement early even though it seems too far away. Tell the people you care about that you love them regularly because you never know when they will be gone. Don’t keep your eggs all in one basket as far as your career. Have backup plans and keep learning new skills. You never know when you will be laid off. Learn about philosophy and skepticism. You can never be too skeptical. Seek truth and avoid being scammed. And remember, the journey to a goal has to be more important. You can’t just be happy when you reach a goal. Learn to really enjoy the process because most of this life is the process. Enjoy every moment, even the failures. That’s how you learn and grow. I’m 35 now and I have learned all of this in the last 10 years. Good luck, wish you all the best :)",0
"my old man always sprouts off enormous poems that he memorized long ago. 
here’s my favorite. 


WHEN I play on my fiddle in Dooney,   
Folk dance like a wave of the sea;   
My cousin is priest in Kilvarnet,   
My brother in Moharabuiee.   
   
I passed my brother and cousin:           
They read in their books of prayer;   
I read in my book of songs   
I bought at the Sligo fair.   
   
When we come at the end of time,   
To Peter sitting in state,    
He will smile on the three old spirits,   
But call me first through the gate;   
   
For the good are always the merry,   
Save by an evil chance,   
And the merry love the fiddle    
And the merry love to dance:   
   
And when the folk there spy me,   
They will all come up to me,   
With ‘Here is the fiddler of Dooney!’   
And dance like a wave of the sea.",0
"I grew up poor and left my home town to go to London for university. I have since lived In 9 cities and 5 countries.

I have 3 cousins died of drug overdoses and suicide and a brother a heart attack due to cocaine abuse.

My nieces and nephews are growing up now in the same poor town as me and I see them all misbehaving at school and they will leave with terrible grades go straight into minimum wage jobs and that will be there life. I try and get them to dream big but they don't realise they can do anything they set their mind too so they don't try, nobody expects anything else of them.

So I will say. You can do whatever you want to do in life within reason, dream big, do well in school because it will open up doors for you.

Even if the people around you don't have any expectations of you or aspirations of their own. You can do whatever you want to do with your life so think about what would make you the most happy then take steps to achieve it. 

Don't just settle for bare minimum. Try and reach your dreams even if it leads to failure sometimes as it also leads to success so never give up and find a way to fulfil your dreams.

"Invest wisely. Save an emergency fund for you to live on for a while if you need to. When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time and act accordingly. Trust people but get receipts. Don't commit crimes, it's not a matter of if you will be caught, but when. Never talk down about anyone's family member or significant other, even if they do. Even if they act like it's ok, it will build resentment eventually. Take care of your health. Once it's damaged you usually can't get it back, and when you're healthy you can't fully appreciate this, but your health is everything. Without it everything else goes to shit in ways you can't imagine on many levels. Not everyone needs to be in your life, don't keep toxic people in it, but at the same time be careful burning bridges. Not everyone you dislike needs to know it, you never know when you might need someone's help. A lot, and I mean a lot of the time it's not what you know, it's who you know, so make connections.

 Invest wisely, especially investments that bring passive income, that bears repeating.",0
"The life game is 90% mind play. You have to first know what it is you want in life then picture yourself in your mind already achieving it. That feeling you get when you see it is the soil your thoughts will grow in. Take care of your thoughts for they are the keys to manifestation. Your imagination is where it all begins so don’t get locked into mindless, repetitive, autopilot mode. 
Read think and grow rich, how to win friends and influence people, 7 habits of highly effective people, and richest man in Babylon at least 5 times.

"Seek responsibility and take responsibility for your actions. If you know you messed up take the heat. Use it as a lesson to better yourself rather than blame others for your issues. Blaming others gets you nowhere and causes more issues. The minute you take responsibility you begin the learning of the issues to prepare for the next time.


If something goes different than you wanted it doesnt mean it's over. Say ""good"" and move on. Didnt get that promotion? Good, now you have more time to better yourself. Didnt get the new hear you needed? Good, now you can learn to improvise and better your creative thinking skills. In every situation there is some good, you just have to find it


Never ask your subordinate to do something you would not or have not done yourself. Pretty self-explanatory. Dont just be the leader in the office, get out there and show your subordinates you are doing stuff too and that you are willing to work with them


Be a leader for the boys (or girls). Be there for your subordinates and make yourself available. This doesn't mean that you be a push-over, but also have a compassion for those you are leading. Shit happens, just be sure to be the leader you would want to have


This is mostly leadership advice for anyone, but it is worth taking it into account and trying to implement it",0
"Not a Dad, but this is the fatherly advice I received from the male role models in my life. 

Learn to budget your money. Being smart with your money no matter how much you bring in will always be important.

Don't settle but also don't be so quick to push away. Whether that's with a job, a friend, a partner. Always look at the whole situation, break down the good VS the bad, and when you want to run, give it a few days. 

Learn simple tasks, basic first aid, how to change a tire, how to recognise a potentially dangerous situation, how to use a paper map and compass. Things you may not always need but when you need them you really need them. 

This more so applies to being a young man (at least for me being male), but I feel applies to both sexes. Learn there is no wrong way to be a man (or woman). You don't have to be 6'2"" with big muscles and a gnarly beard. Meat headed gym nuts with shallow attitudes are only appealing for so long. Kindness is what counts. Apply that to being female however you feel suits you but its true.",0

"I see a lot of money comments but I don’t know if I saw this little tidbit added.. have multiple bank accounts. One for spending, one for bills, and one for saving. 

I’m 28 so not too far off from you. And my father passed away 10 years ago, at that age I didn’t have a good understanding of budgeting so I learned the hard way. And the only way I actually did learn was thanks to my step father. 

It sounds simple but I will give you an example and use easy numbers to make it as easy to understand as possible. 

Let’s say your -

rent is $100. 
Cable $40. 
Phone $40. 
Car ins. $20.
Utilities $100

Total is $300

You take home $150 a week. $600/m with a 4 paycheck month (some months will be 5)

You need to put away $75 a week to pay all your monthly bills. As soon as you get paid every week take $75 and put it in the bill account and this way you will always have your bills paid. 

You want to save $10 a week just to save, take that as soon as you get paid and put it in your savings. 

Now you are left with $65 and that’s your anything money. Gas in the car, food, spending.

Really makes life easier when you know your bills are always paid.",0

"When looking for a lifelong mate as in marriage please focus heavily on how they communicate their needs and wants. Communication is a central factor that can make or break relationships. After that talk openly about your expectations for sexual expression and fulfillment, of you want kids - how you and your partner were raised - your expectations on parenting, talk about your faith and values - what makes you passionate or angry, talk about how you view money - how to spend and save. 

Lastly watch how they interact with others - especially when they are not “on” like with family or even a waiter. Watch who they mode themselves after - who do they look up to and and want to be like. Not just who they say but actually how they act. 

If you hesitate to ask any of these questions or they are resistant to answering - deeply consider whether your relationship is mature enough for marriage.",0
"If its worth spending your time on it, it's worth doing it right.

No comfort in growth, no growth in comfort. Your growing pains will always be there but it wont always be physical.

Compassion to all things. Live and breathe the golden rule without any expectations of getting it back from anyone.

You know what you're here for, you don't owe an explanation it to anyone. People that care will try to understand. Stand tall and be the good.

The only person you should try to be better than is your past self and the flaws of our parents.

"Time will pass anyway, so do something tomorrow’s you will appreciate.

It’s easy to look as learning as a big time investment. Maybe you’ll want to go back to school or take classes and think, it’ll take forever to finish that. Is it worth months or years to get into shape, learn a new skill, get a degree?

Remember that the time will pass anyway. In a week, a year, or a decade, you won’t want to look back wondering where the time went.

So do something memorable, something you’ll appreciate. Take a trip. Learn a language. Learn to cook. Build a kite. Call a friend. Become a phlebotomist. Whatever fits you — whatever you’ll be glad you did, spend time on that.

Because the time will pass anyway.

"Buy high quality tools, so you only have to buy them once. 

Keep a change of clothes at the office. 

Never hit anyone unless they are an immediate threat.

Learn to wet shave. 

Nothing looks more badass than a well-tailored suit. 

Shave with the grain on the first go-around. 

Always look a person in the eye when you talk to them. 

Buy a plunger before you need a plunger. 

Exercise makes you happy. Run, lift, and play sports. 

Brush your teeth before you put on your tie. 

A small amount of your paycheck should go directly to your savings account every month. 

Call Mom and Dad every week. 

Never wear a clip-on tie. 

Give a firm handshake. 

Compliment her shoes. 

Never leave a pint unfinished. 

If you aren’t confident, fake it. It will come around. 

You can tell the size of a man by the size of things that bother him. 

Be conscious of your body language. 

The only reason to ever point a gun at someone is if you intend to shoot them. Period. 

Always stand to shake someone’s hand. 

Never lend anything you can’t afford to lose. 

Ask more than you answer. Everybody likes to talk about themselves. 

Never have sex with anyone that doesn’t want it as much as you. 

Go for women out of your league. You may end up surprised. 

Manliness is not only being able to take care of yourself, but others as well. 

Go with the decision that will make for a good story. 

When you walk, look straight ahead, not at your feet. 

Nice guys don’t finish last, boring guys do. 

Find your passion and figure out how to get paid for it. 

Don’t let the little head do the thinking for the big head. 

No matter their job or status, everyone deserves your respect. 

The most important thing you can learn is personal responsibility. Bad things happen; it’s your job to overcome them. 

The first one to get angry loses. 

A man does what needs to be done without complaining. 

Never stop learning. 

Always go out into public dressed like you’re about to meet the love of your life. 

Don’t change yourself just to make someone happy. 

If you’re the smartest person in the room, you’re in the wrong room. 

Luck favors the prepared. 

Women find confidence sexy as hell. 

Do whatever you want to do, but be the best at it.

"Take interest in things. Be mentally engaged, be mindful.

 Don't rely on others for happiness, find your worth in yourself, in your hobbies. And it's ok to spend money on your hobbies.

I wish I learned that last bit sooner. I was never told it, but figured it out watching my best friends father. He always poured himself into any hobby he enjoyed. Archery, gaming, golf, guitar, fitness, growing weed, and now flight simulators. The guy built himself up from a janitor to making over 120k a year with 100k in the bank. He has taught me alot about being a person. 

With work, I'm mentality engaged, mindful of what it takes to stand out. Trick my brain into learning things I would otherwise have no interest in. The trick is, I wanna move up stand out,  if X = praise and a drop in the bucket of success, I'll do X exactly as it should be done, covering all angles so it's perfect. X outside of work means nothing, but at work it's everything and I don't forget it. 

This applies to everyone, never rely on anyone who didn't have a long track record of reliability. Example I have 5 great people in my life. If I need anything I can call them, they willf stop what they are doing and help me. One is my mother the other 3 are life long friends and 1 is my life long friends father. I didn't have a father growing up and my mother taught me that friendship is thr most important thing, that blood means nothing, trust and respect is earned. 

Mostly love yourself, enjoy ther little things, the sunrise, fresh cut grass the way the wind blows as the trees move and the birds chirp, your friends laughter, good moments in time that are often overt looked by daily stress and the passing of time.

I wasn't told most things, I figured it out, mirrored successful people, found my self worth and lost it many times, but I always seem to find it again. 

Fathers are important, but they don't nef to be blood related. My real father hasn't been in my life since I was 8 or 9. You don't realise how damaging that is until you grow. But it doesn't mean I don't have bonds with older men. If that's not possible you will still manage.",0

You can have fun with lots of different types of people, but for real friends, look for people that you can grow with.

For love:

Learn to love yourself for who are are first. Then you won't be desperate in looking for love externally.

• a swiss army knife with all the tools. (Make sure it has a corkscrew, because you will never regret helping someone open a bottle.)
• a small kit of hand tools like hammer, screwdrivers, scissors, wrenches, saw, files. Have someone show you how to use them if you do not know. (you will be amazed how many people will go out of their way to share tool knowledge with you if you ask.)
• a good, wool blanket (army surplus or LL bean or Pendleton, does not matter.
• a couple of those shiny metallic emergency blankets. They work.
• a gallon of water with about 6 drops of bleach in it will stay clean for months; It has a thousand uses and if there you will use it for a lot of them. As an alternative that does not need to be refreshed, get a LifeStraw.
• a few power bars to nibble on, they can last years.
• a USB rechargeable flashlight
• a firestarter or two (matches, a striker stick or some fuel-soaked bits in sealed packaging)
• a small airplane bottle or flask of good liquor. Not vodka or tequila, those are for spring break at the club. Whiskey, Scotch, Bourbon or go hardcore and use plain moonshine or everclear, which can also be used like starting fluid for a carburetor or a campfire.
• a sealed container (even a ziplock bag) with some aspirin, ibuprofen, toothpaste, toothbrush, bandaids, tums, eye drops, cough drops, safety pins, a razor blade, a couple of any meds you must take daily
• a roll of gorilla tape. Not 3M. gorilla tape.
• a compass.
• a dry pair of socks and underwear in a ziploc
All of these things seem obvious enough, but during your travel through life, if you need these things or someone you meet needs them, having them on hand is a magical experience.

Money: Don’t get sucked in to credit card debt. Don’t put more on a card than you can pay off in cash. Live a little under your means so you can save. Pay yourself first, 10% off the top of you can, set it up to automatically come out of every paycheck. If your company has a 401k match make sure you save enough to get it all. It’s free money don’t pass it up. Every time you get a raise, bump your savings rate +1%. If you do it with your raise, you won’t miss it. When you get an SO, be the one who manages the money. A lot of girls give this job to the man—don’t! It’s too important. If your SO is really better at investing and you want them to handle, still make sure you know where all the money is, have the account #s and passwords, go over the statements regularly. When it’s time to treat yourself, experiences are part of you forever, things either get lost or clutter your house.

Repairs: Learning to do simple home and car maintenance can save you a lot of money, and also give you a great feeling when you succeed in fixing it yourself. Get yourself a decent set of basic tools and don’t be afraid of them. YouTube is great for this. Ask friends for help, but ask the person to teach you, and you do it with their guidance don’t just sit and watch.

The Three Be’s: Be kind. Be true. Be brave. In that order. Honesty and authenticity is important but if you have a choice between brutally honest vs kind, choose kindness—that’s why it’s first. (Don’t forget to be kind to yourself, too.) Bravery—standing up for yourself, standing up for others, taking risks, those things are harder but sometimes you need to ask yourself what would you do if you weren’t afraid, and take that leap. At 22, now is the time to be taking some risks. If there’s something you want to try or someplace you want to go, do it don’t wait.

Finally... Volunteer! Meet people, learn stuff, be part of something bigger than yourself, make a difference.

Best wishes!",0
"Surround yourself with people that treat you with respect, love you for who you are, and encourage you to be the best version of yourself.

My oldest daughter is 10.  Is there anything your dad said or could have said to you that I could pass onto my girls at this stage?",0
"
Wow! A lot of people gave some really great advice. Here are somehings my dad never taught me, but life taught me through great people and experiences “listen” a skill we often forget the older we get. We get wiser everyday, but that doesn’t mean we should stop listening. The world and it’s people has so much to offer us and if we don’t listen to it or the people in it, especially the people we hold most important to us they/it will slip away. Practice it as much as you can because the older you get the hard it gets. 
Pt 2. “Sensitivity” crying, being confused, being emotional, hurting non of these traits will make you any less of a “man”. Part of this monologue from the movie call me by your name kind of explains it a little Better Ethan I can “We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster, that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to make yourself feel nothing so as not to feel anything ― what a waste!” My father was cold and would only show anger. I pity him. He has lost his ability to express sadness or hurt because of the world that made him. Don’t let yourself be “bankrupt” of emotion. Feeling is a sign that you care. That you are alive and is shown to be more of a man than most.
Pt3. My final lesson is a little biblical. We are all creatures on this earth. We all bleed the same blood, breathe the same air. Don’t let bigotry or ignorance control you. Every person on this earth is your brother and sister they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. It doesn’t matter race, creed, gender, sexual preference, we are all people. Love people fiercely. Love people until there is nothing left. Show them compassion where the world may show them pain. It may drain you. It may leave you vulnerable to pain, but in the end i grantee you it’s worth it 
Hope these helped!",0
Not advice but that's crazy. My father passed away when I was 12 and I'm 22 now. I'll be reading the comments too,0
"Some of the best advice my dad gave me before he passed away last year was about not making things not so complicated, ""you're not building a piano you're thinking to hard about it""",0
"Ummm I'm 42 but I was 7 when my dad passed away.  I have two kids now and all I can say is that if someone asked me if I was doing a good job parenting, I'd probably say no, because I'm lost.  If that asked me to look deep in my heart and all of I'm a good father... I'd say I'm not doing too bad, but man, I could be better.  

The key here though, is I admit my faults to my children.  I also work on them by asking them to call me out when I mess up.  It takes a lot of trust, and it's still not sure fire, but I do care and I do really want them to happy.",0
"When times are bad, hang in there. This too shall pass.",0
"1. Know yourself. Understand yourself, your strength and weaknesses

By doing that you wont be swayed by other people’s opinion.

Example:

Someone: “Haha you are a slow thinker”
You: “Yes I realise that. I prefer to think first to take any decision wisely. I am also improving my thinking process speed”


2. Sociopaths exist around us

Learn about sociopaths. Avoid unnecessary drama by simply avoiding them in your real life. Learn their characteristics so you know who to avoid, and if you happen to have to deal with one, learn how to deal with that person safely.


3. Consistency leads you to success

Not your IQ, not your money, not your network, not your hardwork, not your luck.

A person might have all of them, but if he is not consistent in working it out, he wont be successful.

This is why successful person will still be successful even if he start everything from scratch or even debt.


4. Dont be afraid to try new things

As long as the new things do not have long-term consequence, such as unwanted pregnancy.

Learn many things, understand how things work.

There are many things to learn:
Leadership, communication, hand sign communication, morse code, other languages, magic, relationship, understanding man, understanding woman, programming, video editing, puzzle, drawing, arts, practicing expression, how to find out if someone is lying, math, physics, religion, fashion, hairstyle, etc.


Those are what I can think to spontaneously answer your questions. Hope this helps.",0
"This may be common sense, but something I have learned is: be honest. It is self-explanatory and a basic rule in life, but stick to it. A part of that is making right on wrongs. When left unfixed, they can fester and cause problems in self-esteem.

Also, if you go to college/university, work hard from the beginning and learn well. I didn’t study enough at university and, while I did pass my classes, I can’t remember some of the material (chemistry) and it threatens to kick me in the butt in future jobs.

Take time to be out in nature. It is healthy for your body and your mind.

Get enough sleep and exercise.

Learn to function alone. Whether at home, at work, with friends or family, etc become comfortable with being alone. Friends will come and friends will go, and family may not (unfortunately) be there for you. You will grow stronger and be more capable if you are able to function by yourself and value your own company.

Read. It can lead to wonderful adventures, and will help you to continue learning. Knowledge can save your life.

Learn first-aid and some survival skills.

Don’t do drugs.

Be kind to others.

I am not a father, and I (24m) still have my father, but these are some things which I have learned or gathered. Good luck!",0
"Never judge people, even if you ""know"" them. You never really know what people are struggling with. So, try to have and show compassion, even if it's something as simple as a smile to a stranger. Kindness, goes a long way.  

Best advice if my life, hands down.",0
"This will get buried. But the biggest lesson i have learned, and would pass on to my children. Is it’s okay to be sad and mope around. Lost your job? Heartbreak? Bad day? It’s okay to be sad BUT you have to move on you have to keep moving. Take a day, be sad, watch Netflix and eat ice cream. But then the next day you move on.",0

"1-Career. Find a career in something you love and is financially rewarding. If you have a particular edge such as customer relationships or a special skill you can branch off and likely will become a successful entrepreneur. Go at everything 100%. Do not trust any boss or corporation. They will always throw you under the bus if things take a downturn. If you want a career in government, make sure you get your pension, it is the most important aspect when you are older. 

2- Personal finance. Save at least 10% of your salary/income, hopefully more. Seek wealth not things that show off to others or stroke your ego. Have a separate emergency fund. Only buy a home if you know you will be in it for 5 years or more OR it is a quickly expanding region with increasing demand. Buy things you will cherish over time and fight the urge for spontaneous purchases. Do not buy things on the spot, especially timeshares.

3- Marriage. The person you marry will not be the same person in 20 years. Marry someone who would be your friend gerneally, rather than someone where you mainly have physical chemistry. Half of people get divorced and many still married are unhappy. The best thing in life is having children of your own. Love them unconditionally.",0

"I'm a woman, but I can pass on my father's wisdom from when I was a teenager. 

""Find a man that will treat you with the same respect and protectiveness as I do. He's not supposed to harm you, but protect you from those who do. Find a man that will be the safe space when the whole world is on fire, not be the arsonist himself. Find a man that will be offended when you're scared - since you both know he has everything under control. If a man questions your beauty and humanly worth, he should be out of the door, because there's no circumstance under which he'll be right about that. Find a man as such, so that when I'm no longer here, I can rest peacefully knowing you're taken care of."" 

I'm so sorry your dad isn't with us anymore, but he'll always be with you. And whoever you are, whatever you do, I can almost bet that if he were to look at you now, he'd be hella proud.",0
"Dear u/InsomniacReaper,

First off, I just wanted to say how sorry I am that you lost your father. Losing someone that is supposed to be such a large part of your life hurts and if you need to, talk with someone you trust. I know my comment will probably lost to the wilds of Reddit and I’ll probably repeat a lot of things already said, but I wanted to pass on some things I learned while making many mistakes and hope that you’ll never have to make them. If you have any questions or need me to clarify anything don’t hesitate to reach out and ask any questions you may have.  

1. There is nothing worth having if you hate everything you had to do to get it. 

There are a lot of things we want to buy and there are a lot of jobs in the world. If you’re staying at your job because it pays well or just seems like the thing PEOPLE DO at this point in their life... then don’t stay there. Find something that makes you happy and then find a place that makes you feel good and will help you pursue whatever career you choose. 

2. Don’t let the fear of something not being perfect prevent you from pursuing it. 

This can apply to so many things but I’m speaking more along the lines of people. No one is perfect and you shouldn’t expect them to be. Also, don’t expect yourself to be perfect either. I’m not speaking just romantically either. Friends, family, co-workers and even strangers. People are a complex mess of thoughts and emotions trying to get through the day. Don’t go looking for only the negatives and take the time to find the worth of another person. You might be surprised to see how many good people are out there. 

3. Your health is something worth investing in. (Physically and Mentally) 

I was constantly told this by my father growing up and I never listened. Holy shit do I regret it (Sorry I tend to swear a lot and we’ll touch base on that in number 4). I was young and ate Taco Bell basically for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I was always active and still am, but there are two things that I wish I paid more attention to. First of all, nutrition is crazy important and can be the difference between feeling like crap all day and feeling ready to tackle anything that comes your way. Secondly, take time to heal! Physically and emotionally; never disregard your mental health. I would get hurt and try my hardest to just keep moving on. Whether it was a break up or a broken leg. I ruined a lot of good relationships by not taking the time to heal. I’ve also ruined pretty much my entire leg from pushing it when I should’ve just allowed it to heal. There is nothing weak about taking care of yourself. 

4. Always be your true self. 

I know a lot of people who try to be different when they are in public or at work. They try to act like how they believe people would like them to act. The problem is no one can fake it forever and eventually people will come to know who you really are. I’m not saying fuck it all to socially accepted or work appropriate behavior. Just don’t pretend to be anyone than who you really are. If you try to fake your way through everyone is eventually going to find out and you’ll just be THAT person who lies about who they are. This also applies to your faults. I’m not perfect. I swear a lot and make way too many inappropriate jokes to my wife, but thankfully she accepts all those things about me. I also use to be so angry and irrational sometimes. I had to be honest and true to myself about those things too. I was unnecessarily short tempered and rude just because I was having a bad day or stuck in a bad place. I was lucky enough to have someone in my life that called me out on my bullshit and I was honest about who I was and learned to better those parts of myself. 

5. Always be open to learning.  

Yes, school is important, but there is so much more to learn outside the classroom. Not only is there a lot to learn about this amazing planet we live on but there is a lot to learn about yourself as well. Finding new things to learn about is probably one of the best things I could have ever done for myself. Not only did appreciate more of the world around me and the different places, history and cultures of the world. I found out a lot about myself and who I wanted to be. Never miss an opportunity to learn. At work this has made me an expert in my field because I was never afraid to admit other people might know more or have something to teach me. I have yet to find a single downside to the benefits of learning.  

6. Find someone who wants to grow and wants to do that with you. 

This time I am speaking romantically only because that is where this experience comes from. No matter who you are, no matter how much work you put in to yourself. You’ll never be “perfect”. The same goes for anyone you fall in love with. My wife isn’t perfect and I sure as hell am not perfect. We both accepted these things about each other and made a very conscious choice to work together and grow as a couple in a direction we both want to move in. It’s a cliché but communication is everything in a relationship. Be honest with what you want out of a relationship and what you expect out of a relationship, but don’t just dictate these things (I did that a lot when I was younger). Ask your partner what they want as well. What do they want to improve on? What do that want for their career? What do they want for a family? The right person will want to talk with you and grow with you. Also, never think having this conversation once is good enough. Having these conversations a couple times every year, is what helps keep my wife and I on track. To ensure we are growing together, not apart. 

7. There isn’t anything you can’t do. 

I hope all parents would tell their kids this and I hope someone has said this to you before, but if not, here we go. You are a strong, beautiful, brave, intelligent and amazing woman. I believe in you and don’t have a single doubt in my mind that you will go into the world and conquer it. You are everything we as parents to the next generation could ever hope for.  

I could go on for years telling you all the things I’ve learned from messing up. Probably could fill a few dozen books actually... I’ve messed up a lot. As will all things, I have to stop at some point. Just know if you ever have questions, I and all of us here will always be around to help answer any questions you have.  

Hoping for the best of everything for you and your life,

"The likelihood of you finding a good man to marry goes down with each passing year.

This is why /r/whereareallthegoodmen is a thing.

If you waste your 20s fucking around, don't be surprised when your 30s arrive and most of the good men around you are already married, and your dating pool dries up.

Stop looking at your dating pool as ""potential dates to have fun"". More and more men are refusing to get married if it means marrying someone who's wasted their youth and ""ready to settle down"" after fucking 1,000 guys. The good man you're looking for, with a steady job, no debt, and who's good looking and charming, WILL NOT marry you when you're in your 30s.

"I don’t know if I’m the best equipped to answer that question, but it depends on what type of martial art you want to do, since not all martial arts are created equal or even similar. Definitely don’t go to any “strip-mall martial arts” type places, they tend not to be super great. Places you’ve heard about by word of mouth are worth checking out (ie if you’ve got any friends on social media that ever post about them or whatever). Find yourself someone whose passion it is to teach self-defense, they won’t let you down. Now to help you decide what type you want to do, let me give you a run down of a few martial arts I kind of know:

Kuk Sul Do - A Korean martial art. This is the one I did for the longest time. It is fairly traditional and fairly balanced between kicks, punches, and throws. My instructor also did Brazilian Jiu Jitsu so so we did a fair amount of ground work too (like wrestling/grappling, chokes and locking limbs). So our dojang was extremely well balanced.

Tae Kwon Do (Taekwondo) - Also a Korean martial art. The differences between this and Kuk Sul Do are fairly minimal, but imo Taekwondo has a larger emphasis on kicks and utilizing the lower half of your body. Great for starters, but easy to accidentally join a mediocre gym that focuses more on money and business rather than teaching their students well (because this is one of the most common ones).

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) - This is the martial art of martial arts, as in these guys will beat you the fuck up, since BJJ is one of the most dedicated and hard-to-progress-in martial arts. Jiu Jitsu un general focuses on getting your opponent to the ground and then finishing them off there, so ifs basically all throwing people, taking falls, and grappling others into choke holds and submissions. Probably not good for someone who doesn’t want to get serious about martial arts, although it is imo one of the most effective martial arts.

Aikido - I think that’s how it’s spelled. Idk much about this one but I had a few friends who did it. They said it has emphasis on using the momentum of your opponents body to either throw them, get them out of the way and create distance, or manipulate them into a submission. Idk if they do any punching, kicking, etc.

At the end of the day, most people are *very* nervous and feel awkward walking into their first martial arts class, but don’t worry about it. Nobody is gonna judge you no matter your body type, or how weak or strong you are. If you stick with it you’re sure to find your fit eventually. Good luck!",0

I first got this job about a year ago and I remember when covid started curbing and we had some drinks after work one of the new people in the office was like...wait, are you old enough to drink? and ngl it kind of annoyed me.

No one cares about about the other great qualities of the game, just the small factor of the game.

">I'm thankful for the heartaches and the romances that have passed. Trying to objectify women for years has actually done the complete opposite- the more I met and slept with women, the more I realized that it doesn't matter.  

I'm not sure you appreciate how important it was for you to go thru that. I completely agree with most of what you said.  In my 20s all I cared about was having as much sex as I could with as many physically attractive people as possible.  Once I hit 30 everything changed.  

But we're both speaking from positions of privilege in the sense that we were both able to have those experiences and learn from them.  A lot of guys (or people in general) aren't able to have that.  If a person yearns for sex because they have had very little of it in life...I wouldn't come thru and say, ""Sex is as desirable as eating, sleeping, or shitting. It's great for a few moments and then it ends. It's the life you live before and after that matters. There are many more satisfying things in life, filled with much more substance"" because that would be a very tone deaf response and doesn't empathize what they're going thru.  

I think you should celebrate the fact that you were able to experience these opportunities to grow as a person...and give yourself credit for being able to do so (because a lot of people DONT grow).  But at the same time, remember that you're one of the lucky ones and others don't even get the opportunity.",0
"I'm only 21, but I decided about a year ago that I was ready to get my shit together.

Since I've been doing this close to a year now, I've noticed (1.) I get a whole lot more attention from women, and (2.) My taste in women has drastically changed. If there's no friendship connection, or atleast potential, then I just lose all interest. 

Side note, I'm not against smoking daily. I have plenty of friends that do, but they still get stuff done, where my former friends were playing video games 8 hours a day instead of working at a job or on school last time I spoke to them.",0

"There are a few layers to this, but yes.

1. Random sex is glorified masturbation, it feels good but it doesn't mean much afterwards.

2. Seeking gratification from people, men or women, is a dead-end. You'll never be loved by everyone, most people couldn't care less about you. For comparison, imagine the most famous person you can think of, most people still don't give a shit about them, no matter what they do.

3. Needing a partner to ""complete"" your life is a red flag. You first learn to be happy by yourself, then you integrate other people as complements, not as the main focus.

4. A man with purpose, smart planning and consistent effort will end up with money, influence and women. A man who seeks money, influence and women, will end up a hungry ghost.",0

Have worked on and gotten better. All three came back after failed rebounds. I felt like girls just use you as a good guy(I'm not a push over, I earn a decent wage and I stand up for myself and partner) but I also have a passive approach to relationship s and it feels like every girl want you to ""fight for her love"" or she'll find someone else more willing.well I'm tired of fighting for someone who's won't fight for me.

"As a woman, I would hazard pointing out that your question totally led me to believe this was about you discovering homosexuality. Clearly women do make you happy--you mention enjoying friendships and romances with women. So I think you'd do well to not conflate the sex you can get from a woman as encompassing their entire being. (note: I'm not saying this is how you think, but the language you used suggests it) The title might be better understood as you merely replacing the word ""women"" with ""pussy"" as you plainly state that the latter has ""grown to have no value whatsoever.""

Perhaps your previous horny brain is still transitioning? 😅 But yeah, maybe don't say that women don't make you happy when what you're actually saying is ""fucking them isn't as crucially important to me anymore.""",0
"Sex is still definitely in my top 5 favorite activities.

But it kind felt like from age 15-25 that was literally the only goal in life and that everything else was just a fun way to spin my wheels between romps in the sack. Like everything was about getting laid. Going out with the boys? Hoping to meet a girl. Doing well in school/work? Hoping success will bring interest from women. Getting good at almost any hobby? To impress women. Hell even hanging out with the boys and no girls around felt like it was about somehow impressing non-existent women who are not seeing the activity were up to, and yet it felt like I was still trying to turn fun time with the boys into ""Stories later to impress women."" if you catch my meaning.

Now I've got a lot different focuses and a lot more stuff on my plate worth delving into instead of looking for my next proverbial shag. I also met a beautiful amazing woman who I married and is more to me than just sex object.

But I also had *lots* of sex from age 15-25 and so on. That isn't a brag, it's just to help inform. Someone who has been a stone cold virgin until they were 25 or older may feel differently about sex since they've only recently started having it. But I've known at least half a dozen women, done it a lot with a few of them, and done it in almost every way you can, even had a threesome or two.

Kind of got it out of my system, but it's still pretty awesome. But I don't feel like it's the only reason worth essentially living now.",0

"I'm around your age, same sort of story. I've fucked many, many women in my life. Dozens per year since I started college, eventually you realize it's all kind of pointless. Sex is like eating, it's fun in the moment but the feeling doesn't last and when you're done you've got nothing to show for it. I've found that while I enjoy sex, a huge part of why I was chasing it was the validation that went with it. It wasn't that I thought sex was objectively super fun, it was that I liked feeling desired and wanted when I had sex.

Fast forward and after fucking what is probably close to a hundred different women I've slowly realized that it doesn't really matter at all. Sex is no longer validating, which means sex is no longer all that great. Now I'm really only excited to have sex if it's with a girl I'm really passionate about or if it's extraordinarily kinky. I'd rather jerk off than fuck some cute 23 year old accountant.

It has made dating much less exhausting, though, because if I don't vibe with the girl I just end things quickly and forget about her. I don't feel like I have to fuck here for the sake of fucking her, so there's no pretending to like a girl or anything like that.",0
"There are different octaves of love / sexuality. Self development is pretty key and a good relationship is always evolving and being refreshed by whatever new stuff each partner is bringing to the table. 

The fact that you’re calling it “Pussy” is because you’re almost relating to at as a commodity. Once you find an amazing woman who you truly care about and admire on all levels (intelligence, humour, wisdom, beauty, sexiness), you move beyond the realms of “acquiring pussy”... and you enter the realms of sacred sexuality and this stuff is EXHILARATING and always lasts for 45mins to 2 hours on average, and pushes you consistently into new states of physical and emotional awareness.

The human body/mind has a very complex emotional guidance system and when sex is happening without deep love, it can only go so far. The stimulation becomes repetitive and predictable and you eventually feel something along the lines of shame or that there is no point.

Life is infinite. Think creatively, work on creating your best self, and keep your eyes peeled for the goddess of your dreams... they tend to find you once you finally give up and commit to yourself :) 

I swear, I’ve seen it so many times, guys chasing women, always feeling numb after the 20th girl, they lose hope on true love and devote their time to working on themselves and then boom - the woman of their dreams shows up.",0

Mine was more like once every four months or so. Which wasn’t a lot but still better than none for 10 years. Once I got a girlfriend and started having sex regularly, everything changed. I was happier and I felt more fulfilled, I felt normal for a change. It was awesome.

"I'm confused.  Feels like a different situation though.

I don't think any couple is 100% in sync on sexual needs at all times.  I also have no issue with masturbation.  

The people I'm talking about, and honestly OP's partner could actually be one of them and he may just be blissfully unaware, are the people whose primary sexual relationship winds up being with their hand.  The people who would start out not pushing if their partner wasn't in the mood and then just masturbate, and then would sort of start noticing over time that their partner was consistently more concerned with something else and not in the mood.  They would notice that it's been a couple weeks or a couple months since they were last intimate, and that pattern would repeat.  And they'd talk to their partner about it at some point, and their partner would start by being surprised because they're perfectly content and they didn't even realize there was an issue.  And later as the pattern repeats their partner would become defensive in future conversations, because they're tired of talking about something that they are unilaterally just fine with and they resent being told that their lack of interest is an issue.  

Long, rambling paragraph to say that over time it pretty often spirals out.  We aren't talking about a scenario where you jack off every once in awhile, we are talking about people with high drives paired with people with low drives who wind up masturbating daily or almost daily, who go into a sort of starvation mode where it becomes hard not to fixate, who start to resent the fact that their partner doesn't really seem to care about their needs, might not seem to be affectionate in the way they need it at all.  They feel guilty over making an issue if their needs, even though it is an issue, they wonder if their partner is even attracted to them anymore.  It's a bad scene.

It doesn't sound like that's what your situation was though.  It sounds like you were more compatible sexually than the kind of mismatch I was talking about.  Sex was still important though, it just wasn't the real issue.  Sorry you had to go through that.",0

Turned out, I was a more interesting person because I was actually passionate about whatever it is that I was doing, and that made me more attractive to the women I ran into.

"Yeah, exactly.  I think it's often best for people who are sexually incompatible to just go their separate ways.  It's too much to fight through.  Like your ex, trying to explain something to someone that they aren't interested in, that doesn't turn them on, that they have no motivation to do is, to return to the breathing analogy, like trying to explain what breathing is and why it's important to someone who doesn't need to breathe.  You're just frustrated and annoyed and asking ""mother fucker, how are you walking around without breathing?  How do you not get that I pass out and die if I don't?""

Not that lack of sex causes us to pass out and die, but I think that's a fair statement about what happens to the relationship.",0
Yea let me go to the subreddit about asking men to explain what it’s like under different circumstances to be a “dick carrier” and fault them for having a post and discussion about the problem in viewing women as sex objects but as people.

"Thank you for the clarification. That’s a lot easier to work with and you’re right. It’s okay to want a relationship but it’s not okay to think that it’ll solve all your problems because relationships aren’t supposed to be about yourself. It’s about you and the other person as a couple and working together in this world. 

Like you said. You can still want a relationship and actively look for one. But you should be confident enough in yourself to know weather a person will actually add a positive into your life or a negative. I think a lot of young and inexperienced guys think that once they get with someone then all the pieces will come together and that’s where the problems start because a lot of relationships also depend on consistent growth as well. The relationship will never be the same as it was when you first start dating so you need to keep growing or the relationship might fall apart.",0

"So, my great uncle was pretty much my grandfather for how involved he was and how attached I was to him. My most vivid memory was when I fucked up. 

So backstory, my uncle is huge into fishing, not competitive, just hobby fishing every day. So I went to look for worms for the day for us. I was probably 7 or 8. I took a shovel and bucket and headed to the woods. Started digging and like any kid, started prying logs and roots over. I ended up breaking the shovel though. I was terrified. I had no idea how he would react. I had betoken things before and gotten in trouble but mostly it was the fact that I wouldn't be able to go fishing with him that day that bugged me.  I go back and tell him what happened, he laughs, passes me a fiberglass handled one and challenges me to go break it. I went back out and had a great rest of my day. 

I asked him about it when I was older. Why didn't he get mad. He said I broke a tool when using it in a reasonable way. He couldn't get angry for that, because it was the shovels fault, not mine. I know this may seem stupid but it was important to me at the time.

"**Maternal grandpa** (He passed away when I was 3):

One funny thing my mom told me about her dad is that he loved to smoke cigarettes. He loved to smoke so much that whenever they went swimming at a lake or at the sea, he went swimming wearing a hat, sunglasses and a lit cigarette in his mouth. I mean... that's almost Churchill-style (except that Churchill would've smoked a cigar instead). It's interesting how times have changed.

From what I've heard, though, my grandpa was also a very soft-spoken, sweet and caring men who loved his wife and children deeply and treated them with a lot of respect. Apparently, my grandparents' relationship was very egalitarian, which is definitely not self-understanding for people born in the early 1920s. So, I think that's something really cool about him.

**Paternal grandpa** (He is still alive)

When my paternal grandpa was a young lad, about 19 or 20 years old (he's now 88), he went on a vacation trip to the Spanish island of Ibiza. There, he frequented a café in a small town. One day he was approached by a local who was trying to sell land. I've forgotten the details of the story but basically, this guy offered him insane amounts of land for pocket change (it was all real, no scam). The land was located right at the coast and it would've cost my grandpa something like 50 cents per square mile. Now, this was a little more money back then but it would still be pocket change today; maybe $5 in modern-day money. The guy who sold the land told my grandpa he could buy 20, 50 or even 100 square miles. Back then, the land was basically worthless because nobody had any idea what to use it for. It was just beaches, wild meadows etc. My grandpa declined the offer. The guy then asked my grandpa if he should show him the area, so he might reconsider. However, my grandpa again declined. In his words, he couldn't imagine why he'd possibly need land on a random island called Ibiza. Affording the land would've been no problem at all, my grandpa just couldn't understand why he should buy land.

Almost 70 years later, Ibiza is known as a tourism hotspot and a ""party island"" for Europeans. There are large hotels all along the coast and a square mile of land in the area where my grandpa had been is now worth millions of Euros. My family could have a fortune in the 8-or perhaps even 9 figures if my grandpa had made a different decision back then. Instead, we're just regular middle-class trying to scrape by.",0

A few days later I was talking to my dad and he said when they were talking my grandfather said that while we weren't able to communicate well with him, he loved just being near us even if nothing was going on. I'm tearing up just thinking about that. He was honestly the grandparent that I felt closest too despite the language barrier",0

Working in his fairly large garden.  We had strawberries, corn, potatoes, tomatoes etc.  

Pepper.  He liked pepper and I always had to have “that black stuff grandpa uses” on my food.  

Going to the bowling alley with him in the mornings during the summers.  I would have them wake me up early so I could go with him to the bowling alley.  I wasn’t a huge fan of it at the time on some days but damn, I loved that time with him.  He would meet his old buddies and talk about all the stuff old farmers did.  And I would sit and drink my coffee with him just like he had it with nothing in it.  Just straight bowling alley coffee.  I was probably around 6-7 at the time.  Grandma didn’t approve.  Also didn’t approve of him smoking but I wouldn’t rat him out.  On purpose that is.  


I was a middle kid of 5 in a divorced home.  Older siblings stuck to each other and you get siblings stuck to each other.  My grandpa provided me a friend and a father figure.  My grandparents took me in and I loved it.  Up u til the doc finally got on my case about too much dairy (cholesterol and weight stuff) I would still have a bowl of cereal before bed.

But all that apparently changed when I was born. I was his first grandchild, and mom told me he started acting like the father he never was with them (they were 3 sisters, each a year apart).

Every summer I would spend a few weeks with them (we lived far). We often went fishing, which is something I haven't ever enjoyed outside the times we went together (my father loves it, sadly I don't share the passion). He also had plenty of old Russian weapons, so when I was 8 I was already able to handle and tinker with most of those guns. Of course mom didn't approve since it is dangerous, but she can't really say no to her father, can she? We did a lot of engineering on his old car too...

He was one wild motherfucker... He was also who taught me how to play chess, nine men's morris (or known also simply as 'mill'), checkers, and various card games. Lots of math and logical puzzles that I think really helped my school years.

He died when I was 10, and 3 months after my other, paternal grandfather passed too, with whom I did a lot of gardening, farming and tending for animals. Also plenty of carving, I still have one of the - honestly terrible - wooden figurines I made alone at that time. Both of them died earlier because they were stubborn, not listening to the doctor at all...

One of my grandmothers has always had a horrible personality, but the other one was the stereotypical sweet as honey grandmother, but in the last 3 years she's been succumbing to her age and became rather irritating and unreasonable... Times change and it is crazy.

"TLDR; I do have step kids, but no biological kids and I am regretting not having genetic offspring now.

I was an emotional wreck after being widowed at a young age. Years pass, and I met someone while on vacation.  She had a 5yo little girl, and the girl's father had died about a year earlier. The woman and I bonded over our shared experiences and stayed in touch.

A slowly simmering long distance relationship develops. Eventually she adopts her cousin's child. Now she has a girl and a much younger boy. Things get more serious. Visits become more frequent. Talk turns to family and marriage. And we both say our family is complete and we do not want more kids. And we marry.

I am now 48 and I swear baby fever has hit me just this year. Hard. It is biological. It is a craving like I have only heard women describe. I pass the baby section at Walmart and start checking out strollers. This is gnawing at me. 

I am 48. My wife is 44 and had to have a hysterectomy for medical reasons. She is a wonderful woman, loving and caring. But she is not the most educated woman. She asks me to explain medical questions that she or her friends have.

I spoke to her about what I am feeling and she immediately said we could get a surrogate. She heard it costs such and such amount here, but back in her home country it is cheaper. She knows someone who went to a particular fertility clinic back home. And on, and on.  She had very obviously been researching this.

I have been feeling this regret and she has too.  And we are having a discussion we should have had a decade ago.

">Yesterday I was at the mall by myself and I saw this really cute girl in  one of the stores, LUCKILY she was with her dad so I convinced myself  that it was a bad idea, a couple minutes went by and she left the store  and her dad stayed there, “perfect” I thought, but then I convinced  myself that “it’d be creepy if I followed her and what if she saw me in  the store she’d probably think I followed her then it’d be weird”. As  always, my brain convinced me that it was a bad idea. A couple minutes  pass again and at this point I’m leaving a completely different store  and there she is, and at this point everything is perfect, it’s been  awhile, no dad, nothing was wrong. So about 50 feet away I’m ready, I  have the perfect question (at the first store where I saw her, I  overheard her and her dad speaking some language that you couldn’t pay  me to guess, and I was gonna ask where she was from, and compliment her  hair), at around 30 feet I start looking around for her dad, at around  10 I’ve convinced myself she’ll probably pretend she doesn’t know a lick  of English and it’ll be awkward, and at this point I’m 20 feet past  her. I wasn’t looking for anything with that girl and I’m not exactly  upset I’ll probably never see her again, I’m more upset that I genuinely  just wanted to compliment her and have a genuine conversation but for  some reason I couldn’t, how can I go about actually doing these things,  and not be worried about running out of things to say? 

You're trying too hard to be a nice guy.",0
"I agree. Try to relax. Here’s an example: I (female) was in Aldis last summer.  I saw this attractive woman shopping who had on the most killer, brightly colored summer outfit. She looked great. As we passed one another in the aisle I slowed my roll and said, “can I just tell you how awesome those palazzo pants are?”  She stopped, grinned and said “thank you for telling me that and talking to me. Since covid hit its like we don’t talk to one another anymore.”  We chatted for a couple more minutes. And went on our merry ways. You could do the same thing sort of. Go up to the girl and say “ can I just tell you how awesome your hair is?  It’s such a pretty color.”  And add in any other gems you might want. Tell her your name. As much as you can gracefully get in before dear old dad arrives back on the scene. Maybe something will come if it, maybe it won’t. But you will have tried. And gained a bit of confidence.

I wish I’d have asked my grandpa something similar, but he passed from a heart attack unexpectedly.",0
"I would definitely ask questions, but I would also talk to him about those memories together. You never know how much he may remember about those days that you don't, and likewise you may remind him of things he had forgotten from those times. I think he would value that a lot, and you should be thinking about what he will be getting out of this conversation.

you'll have a lot of chances to talk to other people about him, and that will fill in a lot of the blanks about his life. I would just keep that in mind and try not to over-focus on helping yourself once he has passed on, but rather try to create the most meaning out of the remaining time as you can (however you see fit, of course).

The hardest part is after your mother does pass away, you have the feeling that you want to spend time with talking to her but then realize she is not there to talk to. I had regularly talked to her in the three years prior to her death as my father had already passed away.

"Are you their boss or just the one training them? This will be 2 very different responses. 

If your just their coworker who is training them, treat them like you would any friend who you see struggling and just keep asking if they need help and try to be as supportive as you can. At some point though you may need to pass them off to a boss who will be able to give them more direction if they aren't able to keep things focused. It isn't your job to make them a better employee, its to show them the process, and if they aren't getting it you might need to pass them off to someone else.  

If youre their boss then you need to still be supportive but you also need to be clear in your expectations. One of those being that they have to speak up and be able to recognize when they make an error. Errors are OK to make when you're still learning but they have to be able to ask for help when something does happen. They also need to be able to not keep making the same mistake over and over again. Let them know they aren't going to be in trouble for mistakes and if they need to go slow at first that's fine, a perfect project that takes an extra hour is always preferable to a rushed project that has to have a dozen errors corrected. Also make sure they know who they can look to for help, including yourself and other managers and coworkers.


 You could try having them write out the process rather than just going through it manually. Writing it out can make you stop and really think about the steps. If they know it all written out but aren't getting it in practice, then have them go through it all step by step checking off the steps as they go. This will help make each part habit and make them slow down because they're referencing the list.",0

I’ve had 5 dogs pass away so I’ve seen it. When your dog is ready to go you will know. They’ll say goodbye in their own way and find somewhere comfortable to pass (usually in solitude). It’s instinctual behavior for them.

Same with stress, which takes a bit more to unwind and relax as I have to figure out what is causing physical and emotional strain, and take some time to relax.  
Anxiety is a bit trickier to identify, for example, an anxiety attack isn't the traditional ""Chest pains"" if I read about a certain condition which may relate to my current lifestyle, I.E.

"That I broke though that barrier some other people around my age (mid twenties) seem to be content not passing.  Just limiting themselves to a stereotype. I'm basically a muscle bound Dave Grohl looking sob who likes some nerdy stuff with a variety of things not limited to that category.

 I  mean sure, it might not win me many friends, but it's sort of a catch 22/moot/crab bucket  situation.

It's just that people and society was always telling me that I should be the best I could be when I was growing up. So I have went from a skinny wimp, to  a muscle bound jerk and everybody loves me. Along with knowing that there is more out there and that having goals that don't limit myself too much. Having healthy levels of confidence, self esteem and just this social ideal I kept hearing about that would equal a good healthy social life.

It just would be great if more people where appreciative of it, instead of just saying it as an ideal. They  view me as an asshole, but there is not much more I could do that would actually move me forward. What they think would be detrimental to reality, and is based around their own insecurities. People are always talking about cutting toxic people out of their lives, and I know that I have weeded out a lot of what pushed other people away.

I've been married 2x (F,F). Had kids with the first. And brought my kids to the 2nd marriage. She had 3 older kids from 2 other marriages. It didn't go great. I think i tried to over-parent, which didn't work well. Probably did that because my kids were younger and that's what i knew. I don't talk to her kids anymore. I will occasionally say 'hi' to my ex. I'm in a relationship now. She has 2 kids, slightly younger than my kids. My kids don't live with us, they're grown. One of hers is here 1/2 time, the other is home sometime from college. We are mostly civil, but don't hang out. Her youngest doesn't engage with me, hardly talks to me. but that's kind of the type of kid/young-adult she is. My gf gets along pretty well with my kids, they chat / talk. Are able to speak when I'm not around. Maybe it's me as a parent.

He didn’t have to do what he did when he got together with my mom.  He could have played a more passive role like I’ve experienced with a step parent on the other side...  it wouldn’t have been wrong of him to just be a nice step parent.

"Thanks for the kind words...  seriously.  What was really crazy, and I fall more on the agnostic side of the spectrum and would have told anyone this doesn’t make sense, but I had a number of experiences where I felt his presence for a few weeks after he passed away.

One morning I woke up to the sensation of feeling hugged (I live by myself) and in my 30s, and as weird as it sounds, could smell him in my apartment which he had never been in before.

I had a few of these types of experiences shortly after he passed whether things getting knock over (where context had meaning) or extremely vivid dreams or feelings of deja vu and connection.  They stopped after a time but they were so real...  it sounds crazy and wasn’t in my head.

My grandma passed away a month after him.  When she was in hospice, she was still mentally very much there.  I was visiting one afternoon and she was telling me that you may think I’m crazy but I saw your grandfather (her deceased husband) and they were chatting to each other on a few occasions.  This occurred three weeks before she passed.  I asked her if she really believed it was him or some sort of projection from her mind.  She was adamant that they were talking and he was visiting her and knew she was close to the end.

There is something there at the end of life that might not be so black and white.... I’m not religious, don’t know what it means, but these all occurred and were very real.  It sort of changed my thinking a bit on these things.  I obviously know it’s not the physical person or ghosts, but maybe something like energy lingers a bit or those close to death gain some perceptions we may not be in tuned with.

Make sure your eyes are as wide as possible; squinting is suspicious. But don't say anything (even if they do), otherwise they might think you're a cat caller. Don't pass them, match their pace; this is a classic psychology move to create feelings of affiliation and sympathy. They might be scared of other men on the trail, so stick with them as long as possible, and walk as close as possible to them.

You don't want her to lose those feelings of safety just because she cares about her fitness! By the same token, make sure to wait for her if she decides to take a break.

If, despite all this, things still go badly and she starts to yell at you, scream, or threaten you with pepper spray, it's time to whip out the big guns. Show her your hands so she knows you don't have a weapon; they should be as far apart as they will go to the sides and up above your head. Plant your feet far apart and rock from side to side; this is the most soothing of all motions. Give her a big, open mouthed smile (your mouth should be open as far as it will go).

"I've had people talk about me to someone else as if i werent there while i was standing literally right beside them, almost in between them.

Kind of sucks because you realize you arent even worth the effort it takes to look around and see if youre nearby.

Lots more examples are from my childhood but i try not to think about those.  The past has passed.

Edit:  i once had a warehouse job for macys and on more than one occasion i suddenly realized the entire rest of the department had been VTO'd except me.   Manager said ""we looked for you and couldnt find you""... I was literally exactly where i was supposed to be, doing my goddamn job (unlike a lot of my lazy shit coworkers who got VTO'd).",0
you may never fully recover but think that she would not want you feel too bad about her passing. she wants you to thrive.,0
"You don't. As said above you just get used to it and learn to cope. Mine passed 2when I was 15, 26 now and it's still the hardest thing to come to terms with occasionally.",0
"Everybody is different , my mom passed from brain cancer (glioblastoma) a week after I graduated from high school . 

I can remember that first year like it was yesterday. I’d have days where I just kind of forgot , some days it would crash down on me like rock , and some days where I would just sleep . 

I sought professional help , I also sought drugs and alcohol and other stuff that I thought could help kill the pain of her death . I really burnt the candle at both ends for a long time . 

It’s been 20 years since she passed . I’ve lived more years without her than I had with her , and that was a pretty heartbreaking thing. You start to wonder if all the memories you have are true, or if they have started to fade and distort to how you want to remember . 

Like others have said , there will never be a day when you get over it , in fact don’t even make that part of your grieving. 

I recently became a new dad , and when I held my daughter , it all came flooding back in the best way possible . 

I wish you peace and some healing , do whatever it takes to never forget her .",0
"Those moments when I have a question and think “I need to ask my mom” and realize I can no longer do that are the worst. Even for little things, like wondering if I’ve ever been to a particular campsite before. It’s just a reflex. She passed 8 years ago. It’s still hard at times, but this year has been easier. I think my recovery has been a lot slower than most peoples.",0
"Sorry for your loss.

I was 12 when I lost mine - around 17 years ago now and the truth is (along with what others have said here) you don't really get over it.  Life changes and you kind of just have to go along with it.  Dealing with her passing has gotten easier over time but yeah, I don't think I'll ever be over it.

Edit - this is a piece of writing I found I could identify with well:

"Maybe not the same thing, but my grandfather passed when I was 15. I'm 25 now and I still think about him sometimes, still tear up sometimes as well.

The thing is that he lived next us, and we basically did everything together. I'm very interested in both WW's because of him and we'd visit all kinds of things together. When you have a strong connection to someone, I guess you never really get over it.

We were able to say our goodbyes because the doctors knew his last day was approaching. I still recall that day in detail and I left a piece of myself in that room with him when I had to leave him behind. It's easily the worst day in my life and it sent me in a downwards spiral I still struggle with to this day. It gets better over time, but it never fades away completely",0
"About 6 years. I turned 11 five days before she passed in 1999. It wasn't until later in high school after moving off with my dad as he remarried and moving back home with my mother's parents. I think what made me the most comfortable was losing my religion. Completely. That was what gave me the solice that her energy was still here, not just our memories. 

'We were talking, about the space between us all
And the people, who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away

We were talking, about the love we all could share
When we find it, to try our best to hold it there, with our love
With our love we could save the world, if they only knew

Try to realize it's all within yourself, no-one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking, about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself
Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you'

"7 years ago my mother passed at the age of 59, she fought cancer for 5 years and 3 diagnosis. There comes a point where your loved one is dealing with so much pain for so long that you end up at ease afterwards.",0
"Heavy post dude...

My mom passed 1.5 years ago.  I didn't realize at the time that I would NEVER get over it.  It feels like there's a giant black hole in your life, that simply cannot be filled.  Everything you try to do to fill the void just gets sucked in and has not effect.",0
"It’ll be three years this December since she passed and while I’ve mostly come out of my depression, I still have bad days. 

Going back further, my dad passed when I was twelve, also in December. I’m 39 now and I’m still not over it. Long term, I don’t think I’ll ever be completely over either one. 

The biggest piece of advice I can give you, based on my own personal experience, is to be open with yourself about your emotions and what you’re feeling. Don’t bottle your emotions up. Doing so is really bad and will harm you and possibly others short term and long term. Talk to somebody, anybody who’s willing to listen. Ideally it should be a close friend or a therapist, but odds are if those aren’t available, there’s people in this group, myself included, who’re willing to listen.",0
"It’s going to take a long time before you get back to “normal”. Just realize that there’s no shortcuts around the grieving process, you’re going to have to go through it. I’d recommend trying to reach out and seek help from a therapist/counselor. My father passed away when I was very young, I didn’t get the help that I needed for years. But when I finally did I was able to start healing properly. If you’ve got close friends and family don’t feel bad about needing to lean on them for help right now, and if you don’t you have an internet stranger that would listen if you wanna pm me. Hang in there buddy, it’ll take time but it will get better.",0
My mom passed back in 98 and honestly you never really recover. It will always feel like something is missing insde of you,0
"I can’t speak to losing my mom but I can tell you i lost my stepdad two years ago this month, and as a now 31 year old man I still catch myself crying with certain thoughts or songs. It’s just emotion passing through, nothing more, it’s lessened since his passing but it hasn’t gone away.",0
"I am at nearly two years since my mum passed. I still react very much like this, and normally cry when I think or talk about her. I also still have flashbacks of that day that overwhelm me. 

Sorry for your loss. She would have known how much you love her.",0
I don’t think you ever really get over grief. We have a family friend whose son passed away from an unknown medical condition when he was like six and they still grieve internally over it in private.  This happened like 35 years ago,0
"I'm so sorry for your loss

My mother died when I was 23 from lung cancer after a several months long illness. She was the dominant figure in my life (my father having passed away when I was 13 and often growing up, my mom did more of the parenting).

For the first several months, there was a mix of shock and emptiness. But I tried to ignore it. That was a massive mistake. 

I had a low point in my life about a year after. After her death I stopped having the kind of motivation I had before - starting failing at my job, stopped working out, and stopped eating healthy gaining a bunch of weight.

My biggest mistake was ignoring the fact that this was a traumatic/sad effect that would impact me. Had I done so, I could have realized that I was not being myself. 

Good luck and please don't make the same mistakes I did",0
You don’t and you don’t compare yourself to other family members. My husband’s mom passed in 2016. His sisters are over it. They no longer care to prioritize a memorial every year for her. They ruined the last one for him by not wanting to be there. We decided to just honour her in our own way without anyone else. You got at your own pace sweetheart.,0
"My mom passed December 21st, 2019 at the age of 52. I'm still not over it and I don't think I ever will be.  I haven't went an hour without thinking about her.

I lost a cousin, one of my oldest friends, my mother, and another friend within a year.  No 2 situations are the same so I'm not going to try and compare ours.  I just try to take it day by day.",0
"That was beautiful, and I wish you had had more time with your mom. My son is 10 and we both spoke with her the night before her passing, about 9 hours beforehand actually. I didn't say I love you or I'll talk to you later, before handing the phone to my son to talk to her. I regret that more than anything these days.",0
"I'm sorry to hear you lost her on my birthday. Especially it being near mother's day. My mom passed 5 days before her own birthday, while one of her own brothers was on life support. I remember her telling me a ""cautionary tale"" the night before she passed.",0
"I'm on the opposite end of that last part. I've never really been one to celebrate my birthday, but as I spoke with her the night before she passed, she had tried to convince me to do something for me for my birthday. It's hard to change what you're use to, but I want to try celebrating holidays and those I love more often. Thank you for sharing.",0
"This cements the fact that anybody can take anything for granted.

You can regret what you did in the moment, but remember that your love for her, her love for you is eternal.

It is sad that her physical form has passed, but you only need to remember the memories you've had with her. If she was a loving person, loved you, then know that whatever happens, her love for you will never pass.",0
"My best advice is not to try to avoid grieving: set aside some time (30-60 minutes depending on your need) each day to think about her and your loss, and let the tears fall; then pack it, clean yourself up, and get on with living your life (as you can be sure she would've wanted), until the next time you need to 'bleed off the pressure of her loss'. The key is neither to shut down nor ignore the fact... It's essential to *feel* the negative/sentimental emotions, and allow them to 'pass through you' so that they will not trouble you further: bottle them for too long, and they will fester and grow to unmanageable proportions.",0
"I'll be the guy to say it, but I probably wouldn't, and let me explain. I find remakes, sequels and prequels terrible and generally annoying as is, and changes made only for the sake of changes or ""artistic liberty"" also annoy me. Put the two together and it's pretty much a different movie all together so why try to pass it off as the original? It's like the newest ""mad max"" movie, IMO it was pure trash and nowhere close to the originals. If it didn't try to pass off as a mad max movie I may have enjoyed it but I couldn't stop thinking about how different it was. I can't usually watch a movie after reading a book and vice versa for this reason.

Nothing against others enjoying stuff like that though, as I said it's just my personal preference.

Edit for those of you thinking I'm simply talking about turning a male role into a female one, gender swap goes both ways. Take a strong female lead like Kate Beckinsale (Underworld movies) and replace it with a male lead and I'm sure you all would flip out. IDGAF who plays what, it's the change to the story that bothers me.",0

"2

I took my first test after only having driven with family/friends and I made a bunch of stupid mistakes that are fine for real driving, but not on a road test (ie: not waiting long enough at a stop sign even though you can clearly see for 500' in each direction)

Took a few hours of driving lessons with a professional and then passed on the second time.",0
"Where I lived at the time the DMV had two requirements, a written test and a road test. If you were a teenager in high school you could take Drivers Ed. If you passed the coursework in the class with a 94% or higher they'd give you a certificate that let you out of the written test requirement at the DMV, they also had a road course where if you passed it with a 94% or higher, you guessed it, you got another certificate that let you out of the road test at the DMV.

I passed Drivers Ed with a 100 in the course work and a 94% on the road course (I was 0.2 seconds long making my three point turn).",0
"Two.  The first time, I didn't even get out of the parking lot, because the car I had didn't have a passenger side seat belt and the instructor wouldn't continue.",0
"The actual test I got on first go, but where I am you have to do a hazard perception test before the actual test where you go into the licensing centre and they sit you at a computer and you watch this program where things jump out at you from various angles and you have to click in time.

I passed my hazard perecption test on the third try.",0
3. First i failed the eye exam. Second i drove a little too fast on the driven test and failed(was under the speed limit but road was snowy). Third time i passed,0
"Two.  First time I was failed because: ""I wasn't close enough to the curb when making a right"".  Did everything the same way on my second test, save for the *one thing I was called out on* and passed with flying colors.  

I had started studying for the test in one state before moving to a different state (the one I ended up taking the test in), and I always blame differing rules for my incorrect-ness in that instance.",0
"I passed the first attempt, however my one mark down was that I parallel parked ""too close to the curb"" as tires were touching. The guy also spelled curb as KERB. So I'm pretty sure I got a complete moron for my drive test.",0
"Straight up 1 attempt because I heard this exact DMV was chill as fucking possible 

Like in terms of how cool they were it felt as if Shaggy from scooby Doo was my exam proctor 

I almost screwed the parallel parking but I was lucky there was no other cars that day so I just looked jittery upon execution 

Otherwise I practiced the route they have all drivers do there before I even took the test so it went great 

Funny thing was the dude wanted to prank his co worker & there was a random walkie talkie he had in the car so he passed it over to me as a joke 

I as a straight dude with a deep voice said “Hey what are you wearing?”

Co worker goes “BRO WHAT THE FUCK WHAT” 

Then me & instructor start laughing our asses off then he says to go get my shit/go home/good job 

Honestly I got lucky as shit with my instructor & the place being super relaxed. I asked around a lot of my friends at my university among which places had the most forgiving tests & I gladly traveled an extra city over specifically for this one",0
"Three times but because I got literally the worst DMV lady in our entire county. My driving coach even took me to another DMV than her usual one to do it because she was notorious for failing almost everyone-she ended up being there anyway to cover someone else's shift, but luckily I finally passed her scrutiny (maybe she was in a good mood that day because her son's marriage proposal was accepted, though).",0
I couldn't pass the permit test.  It's just a written test.  Failed like 3 times or something.  Finally the highschool had it in the library and I just cheated off the closest girl.  But after that I passed first time for driving.  Also first time with my motorcycle endorsement.,0
"Written test three times (first time I didn’t study on the alcohol laws because I thought just knowing not to drink and drive was enough, the second time I had a computer snafu), passed the practical first try with the lowest possible passing grade",0
"Took me one, but i barely passed the test lol, still got my license and driving 8 years later.",0
"Passed the G license(regular license) on the first try, I'd been driving farm vehicles for a while and dad decided to teach me how to drive with an old beater 4wd GMC 2500 long box with the extended cab so parallel parking a cruise ship would be easy compared to that truck, and it had an exhaust leak a bad torque converter and no 4th gear so anything over 80km/h was pretty much unbearable.

Took 2 tries on the AZ cdl because I passed the driving test and got the A but I failed the Z part so I had to wait 3 days and rewrite the air brake test.",0
"It took me 3 tries to finally pass. I just didn't have enough practice and confidence for the test. My dad never let me practice, and the only practice I had was with the driving instructors. The first time, the person who was testing me had to pull the emergency brake because I didn't brake in time before the stop sign. The second time, I forgot what happened, but I failed. Last time, I passed! Thank God. I wish I had more practice with someone, not just a few one-hour driving sessions here and there. My dad wasted so much money! You can do it, as long as you pass!",0
"I failed my theory test, them passed second time. Them failed my practical test twice, stopped trying, theory test expired. Couple years later tried again and passed theory again and then passed practical test on my third overall attempt",0
"One, but I enrolled in a 6 week driving school where they taught us the rules of the road and how to drive. The drivers test was composed of the knowledge test (failed first time, passed the second) and the drivers test which I passed the first time.

She hopped in. Said ""go ahead."" And I buckled up, adjusted the mirrors and drove. Made two mistakes (bumped on curb turning a corner and didn't back up straight when reversing. She said she doesn't understand why it was on the test because no one ever backs up as much as we were tested on.)

What made me nervous was that she didn't talk much or gave any indication about how I was doing until she handed me the paper and said ""congratulations.""",0
"I passed first try, but I used my dads old car for the test. My sister used my grandads super expensive Audi sedan, and she failed. Pretty sure that the instructor was jealous of the car and thought she was some super riched up bitch or something.",0
"Just one.

I passed the written test with flying colors. During the driving test, I drove too fast in a school zone (as in, I didn't slow down but kept going at the regular speed) but otherwise, my driving in city and on the road were flawless.",0
"I passed my test on the 2nd attempt. I almost got into a car crash on my 1st attempt, literally 1 minute into the test because the DMV person was talking to me and I wasn't paying attention. She was literally yelling ""STOP STOP STOP"" as I slammed on the breaks lol",0
"It took me 2 attempts and I was pretty bummed out after my failure.  I still don’t believe it was warranted. 

I was driving a mini van in a neighborhood and when I was performing the parallel parking portion, the rear window of the van hit a branch that was hanging over the edge of the sidewalk into the street. The instructor counted it as a “collision” so I instantly failed. Haha

My Ma and I drove back to the tree after the test and agreed that the ruling was bullshit.  The 2nd time, I got a much nicer instructor and passed with flying colors.  Sounds like you got a similar shit end of the stick as my first time.  Hang in there!",0
"I did mine in Canada about 10 years ago - where I grew up you needed to test for your Class 7 license, present an N (new driver) sign on the back of your car for two years, then test for your Class 5 so you could drive without the N sign.

I failed my first Class 7 test because I didn't shoulder check to the right enough. I thought it was stupid at the time but the next time I did it I made sure to physically move my head all over the place when I was making any kind of turn, or even glancing in my mirrors, and passed.

I failed my Class 5 the first time as well because I made a turn out of a park zone (30km/h) and made the mistake of thinking I actually was out of the park zone, so began to accelerate. Got to 35km/h and was told by my instructor that we're still in a park zone and the speed limit is 30km/h. She failed me for that, but told me to pay attention and come back in two weeks and I'll be fine. Did just that and got an absolute ***dick*** of an instructor, but surprisingly passed. Grumpy old Polish guy who reminded me a bit of my deceased grandfather, so when he passed me it felt like an actual good accomplishment. He seemed like the kind of guy to fail you because ""meh, you need more practice.""

In the end, don't let it get to you. Driving is easy but driving the ***exact fucking way the instructor wants you to*** is a bit difficult. Practice some more and do it again when you feel comfortable. Not sure where you live but driving around the area where the exam takes place is a huge help.",0
I’m in shock. Glad you passed!,0
"You'll pass next time, try to stifle your nervousness and remember everything you studied and practiced. Taking it mid work day in the week helps as there is less traffic during your test also.",0
"At first I thought I had hurt my back. Woke up early in the morning swearing it was time to get a new mattress. Got up, walked around, went to the bathroom and couldn't pee. Then the vomiting started and the back pain was unbearable. Went to the ER where they loaded me up with pain medication and a drug they give to old guys with prostate issues, Flomax. After a CT scan they determined I could pass it on my own and sent me home with a screen to pee through. I laid around all day with the worst pain ever. Sharp, knife stabbing pain throughout my lower back. Nothing I did made it better. The narcotics they gave me didn't help much. I couldn't keep anything down. Nothing went in and nothing came out.

Later in the evening my wife, who's a nurse, looked at the dose of Flomax they told me to take and said ""Oh, I give guys three times this amount every day. Here, take a few more."" 30 minutes later my kidneys kicked in and I peed like a racehorse. In the screen was a teensy tiny little fleck that was slightly larger than a piece of sand. That's my kidney stone story.

EDIT: As much as it sounds like my wife is the hero of the story, I have to add that she insisted on doing her hair and makeup before taking me to the ER, because her friends work there. I was ready to explode in pain and anger, but had to keep it together since she was my ride. Also, part way through the day I thought going for a drive might help dislodge the stone. During the drive she thought it would be a great idea to take me to the grocery store for a full grocery run... as I'm writhing in pain in the passenger seat. We laugh about it now, wasn't so funny then.",0
"It comes in waves as the stone (or stones, often enough) travels from your kidney to your bladder. I measure it an 8 on a scale of 10 at these times.

You will feel as if you desperately need to find some comfortable position, but nothing works. The result is that you end up writhing on the floor usually.

Then it will find a new spot and the pain will subside for a while. Until it moves again.

Once it reaches your bladder, the worst is over. But not all make it there, and then either surgery or other options are tried.

But until then, it is wave after wave of hell on earth. It may seem like lower back pain at first, but will quickly become deeper and more intense.

Drink plenty of water, get pain meds, and hope it passes. You may also be prescribed a med that will ""open the faucet"" a bit. There's one called Flomax. Yup, the name fits.

Also, try to ""catch"" it with a strainer or something. Long-term prevention depends on an analysis of the stone.

Yes, I've had a few bouts, but none in several years. I caught one, got it analyzed, and was put on a small daily med. Haven't had any since.

Lastly, during one episode when I was at the ER begging for the IV so they could get me morphine (and I *hate* needles), a nurse there said she was a mother and she'd had them, and yes, it's the closest a man will get to labor pains.",0
"I had a 9 mm stone stuck in the junction of the ureter.  Next stop was the bladder but it was so big, it wouldn’t pass through the neck part.  Somehow I never had any of that horrible pain (feels like contractions, I had a wee taste of it and it was bad).  They had to remove it by going up the old gentleman.  Peeing pure blood for 24 hours was painful and very disturbing.   Hope I never get another one.  I was back to normal after 1 month.",0

"I went to a small emergency department, and was next to be treated when a child with breathing difficulties arrived. Lil b#####d took my spot. When eventually treated with morphine, the doctor said I was having a bad reaction to it by almost passing out. Explained it was just pure relief. Before leaving the nurse explained that it should pass naturally but if I start sweating for no reason get to a major hospital. Two days later the pain returns so back to the emergency department. They take Blood and give me more pain relief and send me on my way. Sitting at my computer a day later I realise I'm soaking wet with sweat. Go to a major hospital where they inform me that the results from the other hospital show that my kidneys have reduced function and should have had a stent but in days ago. Have the surgery and it being the first time for me having a procedure am blissfully unaware of how the catheter is removed, am surprised to see the nurse just basically give it a good tug. The feeling of uncontrollable urination is something I'll always remember.",0
"I never had any pain when (and if) mine passed, but it did get stuck between my kidney and bladder, and it was excruciatingly painful. It felt like someone had stuck a knife under my rib and would twist it every few minutes. I got morphine at the hospital, it did next to nothing. Probably top 2-3 as far as most painful experiences of my life.",0
"Well since everyone else explained the incredible pain aspect, the upside is that once it's passed from the kidney to the bladder, it's gone. 

A little soreness may be there but compared to it passing, it's nothing at all. 

Best of luck. Also, when the waves of pain happen I was told that means it's moving and that means it's closer to passing. Not that it changes anything in the moment.",0
"It looked very painful, sometimes he couldn't even move without experiencing intense pain

When my dad finally passed his kidney stone, he was so relieved he gathered all of us to look into the toilet and celebrate the passing. We were all extremely happy for him",0
When you pass a stone does it make a ping sound on the porcelain as it leaves you? I’ve always wondered,0
"With the worst one I had, I couldn’t decide if I was going to puke or pass out. They had already hit me with a decent dose of morphine. Dialaudid was finally what took the edge off.",0
"From the point of leaving the ER to the point of passing the stone I ate a few crakers and sipped on ice water. I wasn't able to urinate all day. It was probably 14-16 hours from the time I felt pain to when I passed the stone. The first time I felt the urge to pee is when I passed it and I wouldn't have known it passed if it were not for the screen they gave me. It feels weird to say, but that was the single most satisfying badder emptying I've ever experienced in my life. I still remember how good it felt... lol

And yes, my wife is gorgeous 😍.",0
"38 matches in the main league each season. Then you have the champions league. Which can get up to ten matches during the main league season. Then there is the FA cup. If they progress far and to the final can be like 14 additional matches. Then every two years there are internationals comps. Euro cup and world cup. Qualifiers for that then the comps themselves. 

So, if you are an absolute pro and top of your game. Could probably be near the 80-90 mark per year. Given the different side cups and nationals etc.

"I like that nobody said ""follow your passion"". Because passions need time to develop. If people are 50, successful as a idk tax attorney or accountant, some of the most boring fields one could imagine from the outside, they will feel passionate about because of the mastery they developed. 

So get out there and try shit, don´t be afraid to change fields etc. The more experience you acquire, the better. Do I mean have 50 internships in one field? No - diminishing returns. Do I mean change job every two weeks? No - you wont have meaningful exposure in any of them. Try to make meaningful choices with experience in mind. A low-paying job with great insight or meaningful experience might be worth it now. Or internships. If you change after a job, don´t take it as a failure, that you did not like it. It is part of the process - you gained an insight about yourself, that something is not for your and maybe even why.

And if a project or an opportunity comes up that you really like, assess it and go give it all. I assume you don´t have a family and kids yet, so you can invest a lot of time now. And you can afford to fail (as in - you can afford to fail now - not to start something to fail from the beginning - more like fail fast, so you can regroup and have a whack at something else.

Try to invest some time in meta-skills and knowledge. Social and people skills. How does learning work, how does conversation work, how does drive / incentive and motivation work? What makes highly successful people (big five character traits) in the workplace and how do you fit in an make the best of it. And what is success anyhow (and so on and so forth).

In regards to your lack of a specific goal - and kinda connecting to my first sentence - If you do not know the world or yourself, it is hard to set a goal. Having a goal is part of a development process. If you work on yourself you will develop a sense of yourself and your values, then finding a goal to apply yourself with your personality, character and skillset, and be passionate, will be possible and less confusing.

Good luck.

"So, I'm not asian *but*... when I was younger I dropped out of a college (and went back to a different one less than a year later).  It wasn't a transfer, more of a start over in a different place doing something different.  My entire extended family that are on the same continent as me referred to me as ""the dropout"" for quite some time so there is some past history there.  When my mom passed away last year (cancer, not COVID), one of my cousins called me to express condolences and he found a way to remind me during this call that I dropped out of college back in 1993.  All of the cousins have Masters except me (BS only), so it was only my career that kept me as not a loser.

I actually think that my mother's passing last year was a significant portion of this as she was in palliative care for a few months before she passed and she had a lot of regrets on what she should have done.  She was in denial most of the time she was in hospice and that was rough due to COVID (no in person visits, etc).

Yes, the negative loop thing sounds like a version of what my CBT therapist had me doing and I'm still working on it.  I've been working on step #5 in your list a lot lately as I've been stressing over things related to the job I no longer have and that certainly isn't good, useful, or productive.

I hope that you are able to convince your wife to work part time and enjoy life.  I had this conversation with my boss but working part time would have cancelled my insurance AND I would still make too much to qualify for any help on the ACA marketplace so I would have to work full time to pay for the insurance.  But working full time gets me insurance, but I don't want to do that.  Nasty loop.

"Ageism definitely exists, but I think that it's more a symptom of the system than a conscious decision by recruiters. 

In my experience hiring people, I typically see people follow two paths in life.

**Good workers tend to have a logically progressive career.** They work hard and they grow, and their resume reflects it. 

**Bad workers tend to have a stagnant career.** They may have long tenure at their jobs, but they aren't necessarily growing in skill or title. Often these people tend to find jobs that they are comfortable in, sink into them, and have little to no ambitions about pushing their career further. 


In the experience I have recruiting and hiring, I typically prefer to hire people from the former group. My reasons for this include:

1. I like to have workers who are ambitious. Most of the roles I hire for have room for growth, and I want to give that opportunity to somebody who I think will work for it. 
2. Older workers tend to be ""set in their ways"". They are slower to pick things up, and are harder to train out of bad habits.
3. Older workers tend to take things more personally and are more arrogant - they especially dislike taking orders from people half their age.

Obviously this is not the case for all older workers, but it's consistent enough that it's hard to ignore. When I'm looking to hire an employee, my willingness to hire an older worker changes on the seniority of the role.  A 50 year old applying for a Director/VP/C-level role is expected, a 50+ year old applying for an entry-level job however carries higher risk.",0
"It has less to do with age, and more to do with experience and willingness to learn. 

We pass up qualified people all the time, because they openly and immediately refuse to learn different systems. 

I will always take the ambitious professional with only 5 years of experience who I can coach and mentor over someone with 20 years at a company who just got laid off who will probably try to challenge the things that I'm doing and be a burden and liability than a productive, contributing team member. 

IMHO, at that age; a professional should have acquired enough industry experience to be able to sell themselves as an outsourced service; either through consulting or temporary contracts. There is a ton of money to be made this way. Just don't be a subordinate, complaisant office monkey doing the bare minimum for the entirety of your career, and you should be fine.",0
"The further you go through life, the more the curves diverge between people who have continuously invested in their skills, and those who have made little or inconsistent efforts in that area.  If you use the preceding years wisely, you will find yourself in a good place where employment, income, and business opportunities are abundant.  Building relationships, storytelling, and negotiation are complimentary skills here which will multiply your efforts.

Certain career paths thin out with age.  For example, certain tech roles like software engineering tend to skew towards younger workers.  If you're in one of those, you'll want to either invest the time to become super adept at high value skills, or make a lateral move into something like management, product, or an executive role.  There are also certain unspoken assumptions about younger workers in tech, for example, that they'll willingly work insane hours and be naive about equity.  Older workers are often assumed to have family commitments where they want to keep more traditional hours, and have a better understanding of the reality of the equity portion of their comp.  So, you'll want to offset that with formidable skills and a proven track record.

Networking is a really key skill in this process.  If you invest in building relationships over the years, many opportunities will come your way through your network, rather than the ""applying to open positions"" game where you start as an outsider.  You have a few decades to build this up, and the compound interest on developing relationships and paying it forward are astronomical (if done well).

Having developed a valuable skillset, a network to put you on the inside track for opportunities, and being able to clearly and concisely communicate your value to people who can hire you will put you in a strong position.  If you don't do this work in the preceding years, you may find yourself in a challenging spot.",0
"Increasingly, I just don't feel like there are things I would say are important in being a ""good man"" that aren't also important in being a ""good human"".

Strangely, many people in my life have said that exactly that is *what* makes me masculine, so maybe it's just not giving a fuck and being the best version of yourself you can be right then? And knowing when to give yourself and others a break, because life is fucking hard and none of us know what we're doing really.

I dunno. Love people. Treat them well, leave them better than you found them.

Forgive failures, in yourself and others. They're part of the process.

"Most advice simply falls under ""be a good person"", which misses the mark for this prompt.

&#x200B;

Our society has reinforced for centuries that men teach men how to do certain things. If you're a man 20 years or older with a father figure, he probably taught you some ""man skills"" -- things women were seen as not wanting to do throughout especially the 20th century.

Continuing on whatever grandpa taught dad and dad taught you, while being open to sharing those skills with all of your children, is modern day masculinity.

It will take decades more for the streotypes of ""men fix stuff around the house, change the oil, handle everything when the family goes camping, etc."" go away. Making sure we don't allow generations to fall away from being able to do these basic tasks out of fear of being seen as toxic is important. You should fully embrace any skills dad taught you. Passing down being ""handy"" is one of the great legacies of the Western man. Teach your kids how to sharpen a knife. Teach your kids how all of the stuff in your house works. Hunting is a masculine tradition, and while it is greatly corrupted by modern ""bros"" and rich Republicans shooting elephants, it should continue. There may be a time where a family legacy of taking the kids hunting and camping a few times to learn the basics saves your great great grandchildren's lives -- look at Texas right now. Clearly we can't trust the government for everything(and I am a liberal man, I'm just being realistic here.)

There is no reason for these skills to be limited to men, but in great part they are right now, so our task is to continue teaching and maintaining these skills until society comes around and our daughters start doing it as much as our sons.

Be there for your kids. Don't resent that you carry traditionally masculine skills -- if Mom asks you to fix her water heater, be proud to help, and if you have a daughter bring her along for the job.

Don't fall into the trap of being sullen and emotionless, just because many men do it does not mean it is masculine. Rather, welcoming the streotypes when they are useful and being there for your family and friends is the most important emotional struggle of a man.

Saying things like ""be a good person"" is cute, but that applies to all people. We are discussing the specific burdens of being ""masculine"", or what men are taught and shown differently than women and how we should handle it in western culture in this time.

All of this is only a fraction of being a good person -- but it is the fraction that men are uniquely burdened with in most families.",0
"To reinforce my point in case it was missed: I do not believe any of this is inherently a man's job, but our society has dictated it so for decades if not centuries, so at this point most men are in fact the ones who are ""burdened"" with being the ones who were taught how the house works, how the cars work, etc. -- we should do all we can to teach our wives and daughters these things, and yes some women do these things now, but for the most part our society as a whole is falling away from knowing these things rather than getting to a point where both men and women do them.

If you were lucky enough to have a father figure you owe it to society to continue teaching all of your children regardless of gender.

Keeping things alive that our grandfathers were expected to do because they were ""the man's job"" is in fact a specific burden of being masculine in the 21st century. We carry the burden of making sure our daughters learn what our grandfathers thought they shouldn't, while still respecting the skills passed down to us and preserving them. It is a difficult balance and defines modern masculinity.",0
"Did you read my posts though?
I am agreeing with you in a sense -- I do not think any of what I am talking about is tied to men anymore. However, our grandparents who grew up in the ""fifties/sixties of the last century"" are the ones who passed down valuable skills only to our dads, who likely passed them only to us. 

It is our duty to keep alive the skills that men have been trusted with until society is ready for women to do them equally. We have to teach our daughters until it's normal. The sixties were not that long ago, we aren't just miraculously past it because a few generations have passed and most people's thinking is in line now. The dissemination of traditionally masculine skills is still on the table -- we are discarding masculinity by paying people to fix our ""man problems"".

Your attitude leads to no one maintaining the skills to fix their own faucet because that's toxic masculinity.

We are on the same team, I just don't think this is a solved issue like you do. Ending masculinity as a cornerstone concept in our society requires men acting in a certain way to make sure a time comes when ""the sink is broken"" doesn't conjure imagery of a man with a little red toolbox fixing it. We need to teach our daughters how to do what our grandfathers taught our dads to do.

Losing skills as a society that our grandfathers had is not the solution to us being uncomfortable with gender roles.",0

"Sorry for your loss. My dad passed in Oct 2019 and while I cried my eyes out for weeks, our family was very prepared for it. My dad was older and his health worsened every year - we were always prepared for the inevitable.

I definitely hated meeting new people at the bar or being in “happy” group social settings because I had this dark cloud following me everywhere and I had nothing cheerful to add.

Therapy helped tremendously, i tend to keep my feelings to myself or try to suppress them. Therapy gave me a safe space to release them and it also taught me to open up to my partner and ask for help when I’m hurting.",0
"   Very sorry to hear about your loss - my thoughts and prayers are w/you.
   I lost my Dad February 17, 2011 and my Mom December 8, 2012. To be honest...I'm still coping and imagine I always will. My experience both times, I started out completely numb. I was awake only for the time I had to be and the rest of the time asleep or trying to sleep just to avoid reality and everything around me. And even sleeping wasn't a true solution because I'd have dreams about them and I'd wake up in an uncomfortable mood/state because the dreams would be so real feeling. I still have those dreams, though less frequently. Some people are comforted by those dreams, but for me I always wake up uneasy. I'm happy for and admittedly somewhat envious of those people who can have dreams about their deceased parents and find them comforting. I hope I can reach that point one day!
   After the initial numbness, came the grieving. Trying to get through the day normal was impossible. I'd be doing ok 1 moment and the next - I'd be broken down in tears, sobbing. Flooded w/vibrant memories of them, thinking back on just days or weeks before when they were still here. The desire of being able to reach out, turn back the clock somehow and be w/them again seems so doable yet of course it's not. Then when the reality hit, I'd get another rush of grief and uncontrollable tears w/an uneasy, dark gloom.
   I slowly started getting to where I eventually could get through some days w/out periodically breaking down but I'd still have an uneasy gloom following me around. Especially when it came to going through their belongings and packing them away, especially w/my Mom because she lived in the same house. So, when it came time to pack her things away and re-do her room for then present use - it felt wrong and disrespectful. How dare I touch and disturb anything? Move it, pack it up and store it away? It just felt strange and unsettling. This is Mom's room, damnit! But, keeping everything in place as it was before she passed away also didn't feel right. When I would walk into that room, I expected to see her. So, packing everything away and re-doing the room was the only thing I could think to do to help cope w/the reality that she was gone and not coming home. But she was at her true home now.
   I slowly started trying to re-gain interest in hobbies, activities etc.... but it was a slow and painful process for me before I could engage w/out thinking about it and forcing myself. Every so often, when a world event or personal event would occur, I'd think, ""I can't wait to call Dad or come home and see what Mom thinks about X or Y. Then it hits you - you can't make that call...you can't go home... I still get that urge at times, even after all those years - and it's always a bit of a gut-punch when I snap back into reality.
   I guess the toughest is when a few years ago, I went through some personal situations (that I'm still struggling w/today even) where I really could've benefited from my parents' thoughts, advice - and just moral support. In lieu of them, I'd just head to the store or bar for a few drinks to just sit alone and think...work up an imaginary conversation w/one or both of them in my mind...thinking about what they might say or suggest. Not really a consolation, but about all I could really do.
   Losing my parents has definitely created a void that will never be filled. It gets easier but something you never fully get over, no matter how old you are or how old you get - in some way you'll always seek that connection w/them...even in death. I think of them every day, miss them every day and can say to anybody who still have one or both of their parents - just please don't take it for granted and make every moment count. You never get them back once they're gone.

That's been my experience, at least.",0
"My mum passed 18 months ago. I held it together for all of the funeral arrangements. Made sure my grandmother was okay, arranged everything for the funeral and wake. I did all of that in a daze. 

Come 6 months later when we were organising her possessions and clearing her house and I was useless. I shut off, ended a long term relationship and withdrew entirely. I didn't get her ashes buried for 6 months after the funeral. I just couldn't function. I left the paperwork and possessions to the rest of my family to deal with. This was when I began to struggle at work.

If you can't be there in this moment, you will be at other times. If you can handle it now but not later, that's okay too. You have to handle it as you can. There is no wrong or right way. 

I'm sorry for your loss. Just know that you need to look after you too. And know that everyone can be very understanding if you just tell them what's going on. Losing someone close to you is awful and I'm sorry.

"I was overhearing a conversation my cousin was having about of our extended family and their experiences in hospitals.

It came to one of her older uncles and his passing while he was under hospice care. He had passed some time at night in his sleep and wasn't noticed until the next morning. At that point his immediate relatives were notified and it took them a day to get there. 



The hospice didn't move his body to their morgue. 


It took them a longer time to finally get there but his body was on that bed for about 2-3 days, covered by a sheet. Some of his family finally arrived, mourned and they noticed some light movement beneath the thin sheet. 

They drew it back and crawling out of and into his mouth, nose and around his eyes were thousands of ants. They were clumped up and suddenly disturbed so they just started streaming off in every direction off his face. 

There was a steady line of them all crawling in from a small crack in the window.

"This happened back in the early 2000s when i was maybe like 12-13ish. My father an i had a friend who was pretty ill of health. We all enjoyed wrestling but he didnt have the ability to watch the pay per views so we would record it on a vhs on sunday an then drop it off to him on monday. so he wasnt to far behind on what had happen on the show. 

Well we called him to let him know we were coming an he didnt answer. We said what ever an just drove over their anyway. Maybe he wasn't home or something. He was very old school an worked the night shift so maybe he was busy. Anyway we get to his place an i hop out of the SUV tape in hand an knock on his door. No answer. Oh well this has happened a few times before no biggy il just put it between his screen door an the other door. I knocked really loud one more time an me an dad left. 

About half a week or more passes by we dont hear from him which is odd because normally he would call my dad after he watched the show to talk about what had happen but nothing. Radio silence. A week passes an finally we get a call. Apparently he was having like a diabetic coma or something similar to that.  Me knocking on the door to give him the tape startled him just enough to ground himself i guess an he was able to call the paramedics to come get him.  He had been in the hospital the entire week. He thanked us for saving him an then went right back to talking about wrestling. 

He passed years back do to his multiple health complications but he was a really cool dude. really odd but really cool. Miss you big AL",0

"that's why I didn't report it. She was a friend of mine, came out lesbian that same day she assaulted me, she even dated my best friend, but looking back had a history of picking up men who were extremely intoxicated. She also had PTSD, a bunch of other issues, was not as strong as me, and I could easily see this going back against me.

I remember letting her spend the night since we were very drunk and she was in no position to drive. I also was okay with drunk cuddles since I don't receive much physical affection and had finally gotten comfortable cuddling with my female friends. None of them pushed past it in the past. So everything done prior to this would make it seem like I was the aggressive one. I passed out and at some point I woke up in the middle of the night as she was trying to remove my clothes. I told her to stop because I did not want to have sex and that we should just go back to sleep. I remembered she had herpes and I wasn't attracted to her in that way, plus she's my best friends ex. Then a little later she was going for it again but got a lot further. Out of fear and shock I literally flipped her off of me and pinned her down and told her nothing was going to happen. Apparently when I did that her arm hit something and she had started bleeding. I literally just ran out of my room and locked myself in the bathroom still super drunk and fell asleep in the bathtub. I kicked her out the next morning. i didn't tell her anything besides she had to leave. 

I was scared. I didn't want to report or do anything because I didn't know if anything had happened and she was the only one with any injuries. I paid for all our drinks that night because she was broke so if anything it would appear like I was trying to get her drunk. When I did tell a couple of friends they all were ragging on me for not letting her take my virginity away and it wasn't until I told them I knew she had herpes that they started taking it seriously. No one told me I should report it. Two actually blamed me for leading her on even though she literally came out as lesbian at the beginning of the night and thought it was safe. 

It sucked cause I didn't want to go out with her that night but felt like I owed her since she helped me the day I was feeling suicidal by going on a walk with me at 4 am a year prior. So it sucked having to go through with it. I had just started opening myself up physically with people too and I shut back down. It's taken me years but I'm warming back up but that shit scares me. She started going off on me when I wasn't responding back to her messages and she started a couple rumors too. BTW This took place in a small private uni too.

I'm better now but fuck that was scary. I'm clean from herpes so as far as I'm concerned I woke up just in time.",0

My routine has 2 upper body, 2 lower body, 2 active rest day or cardio days, and a full rest day (nothing over warm up and stretch).

I write it out in a small notepad because if I pick up my phone I'll get distracted and lose the cardio benefit of lifting quickly. Compound lifts save time. Squat, deadlift, overhead press, and pull ups will work every muscle you have. I include core specific exercises on all lift days. Running or other cardio after lifting usually in an interval of run x distance walk x distance. That said, weight loss happens in the kitchen. You don't have to cut down to chicken breast and brown rice. If your current weight is stable, you can find a way to cut a couple hundred calories and see gains. Watch for calories you drink soda, juice, etc. They add up very quickly. Also, when you eat is it because you're bored or actually hungry. Dehydration can present as hunger as well. You don't have to count specifically but every couple weeks swap something you usually eat out for a healthier option. Trying to change the way you eat suddenly and dramatically is a way people fall off quickly. Eat more protein but you don't need bars or powder unless it's really hard for you to get protein in meals. Gains are slow. Anyone saying otherwise is selling something unsustainable.

Second, what you said is:

>There is scientific evidence that you do actually need sex.

Based on my admittedly limited understanding of medical terminology and only being able to see the abstract, what this article seems to be saying is that the lower the frequency if sex, the higher your risk of cardiovascular ""events"", like heart attacks **may** be.

I'd be curious to see how a lack of cardiovascular activity, antioxidants, or vegetables would have on one's likelihood of a cardiovascular event.

Third, the conclusion is as follows - I've bolded a word or two for emphasis):

>Decreased sexual frequency correlated with higher homocysteine levels in a nationally representative sample of US adults, especially men; this **might** increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or other atherothrombotic events.

"Theoretically I suppose, but realistically there's no way I'd want to have sex forever or meet someone that would want that either.  However, I'm willing to bet that she'd have a heart attack long before I did, if we're both putting in the same effort that is.

If we're talking about real numbers with my wife, though.  For a single session, I'm good for 10-15 and then again for another 10-15.  That's just one session though.  When I first got married I spent an entire weekend having sex with her but we took small breaks every now and then for food, water, bathroom, the important stuff.  Pacing is important.",0
That depends on where you took your graft or if you took a cadaver. Cadavers take about a year. Grafts can take anywhere from a year to two years.,0
Interesting. Did he give reasons as to why? Patellar tendon and hamstring tendon are generally the most common grafts. I do ACL research and am always curious as to how other surgeons decide on which graft to use,0
"What kind of graft was this?  Why didn't they put you under?  I've had grafts before and this just seems cruel,  are you allergic to anesthesia or something? ",0
Oh I see that makes more sense.  I had local grafts from hip bone and rib cartilage so the majority of the pain was from where they took the material.  With cadaver then you only have the one area of pain.  No local anesthetic?  I feel like they would have to do that in order for you not to react during surgery.,0

"My Father adopted me when I was 10, so our relationship was already weird. He was always closer with my sister and bought her everything she wanted when we where kids. He claimed because I was a boy I didn’t need the love and attention she needed. Anyways, I’m in my 40’s now and I recently had open heart surgery. I tried reconnecting with him. I was talking to him about my heart condition and he cut me off and started telling me about my sisters health issues. I was so angry. 
For context I haven’t spoken to my sister in years. She is a drug addict and all her kids where taken away by the State. 
I legit feel like I can’t have a relationship with him because he genuinely doesn’t care.",0
"Alright boys, need your help with this one.

&#x200B;

Here's the thing: I'm a 30 year old man who have never actually had to deal with grief from a close relative or close friend. Yeah, I agree my life may look like heaven in this sense, and I'd say it is. But... well... My grandparents are really getting old. I've got a grandma who's survived COVID at 84, and just got out of a heart surgery after a heart attack (complications from COVID), and I started wondering how it's going to be. My mother is so attached to my grandmother, and my grandfather will also very likely be completely broken, but fact is: my grandmother is extending her years, but she has been getting worse since the past year or two, and I started wondering... how to deal with it when it happens?",0
,
"So the other day I ended up having to go to the ER. My back pain exploded, making it so I could barely walk, I head a tearing sensation in the upper left part of my chest going into my shoulder, nausea, light headedness, and difficulty focusing my vision. I thought either my aorta or subclavian artery tore open. I was sitting on the ground, in a torrential downpour waiting on the ambulance. They get me to the hospital, do the scans, stays, blood draws, administer fentanyl for my pain and then I'm just left there. For 4 hours with no one there. The nurses only briefly checking in on me.

Left to stew in my fentanyl amplified emotions, I was terrified, alone, angry, sad beyond words, and worst of all, broken. I thought my artery had torn open and so did the doc initially until they got images. I earnestly thought I was going to die and it would be alone. I'm slowly recovering from it physically. Mentally and emotionally though, I have a ways to go. I dont have anyone here at university to be there with me. This isn't the first, second, third, or even fourth time this has happened. It is the first time it was this severe though. The doctors dont know what caused it, I've seen some of the best in the world and they cant figure it out. I'meft in the dark on what's causing this and when I'm at my weakest, and most vulnerable, I'm completely alone.

What can I do to handle this better?

Edit: For reference I am 23 with 2 open heart surgeries, chest reconstruction, spinal fusion (T1-T9) and a cardiac ablation. ",0
"My father recently went in for a routine surgery and developed a secondary infection. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal but he neglected to tell his doctors or anesthesiologist that he's an alcoholic (the family suspected but we were never sure).

Long story short, he spent nearly 3 weeks in a coma, had another heart attack (his 3rd one) and even coded once. He managed to somehow make it through and is now at home recovering.

I feel nothing about this. His own father died at 58 after multiple heart attacks and my dad has spent his entire life smoking, drinking and barely doing any serious exercise other than a couple of years devoted to road cycling. During my childhood, his arrogance and aggression at work got him repeatedly fired and we moved all over the country and we never settled down. My brother and I had to be home schooled to avoid constant disruptions to our studies, we never made friends and never took part in any real social activities such as team sports. I think I managed to turn out reasonably okay but the damage to my brother seems to be permanent. 

I spent a good deal of my life being angry and strove to be the exact opposite of him in every way but now that I'm older that fire has died out and I just feel nothing. In fact, when I heard that he may not make it I was actually relieved that I no longer had to pretend to be interested or care about him. I don't want to feel nothing. Life is meant to be experienced fully, with all its ups and downs, not be disinterestedly viewed from afar.

So my question to my fellow men is, is it normal to feel nothing and should I just accept it? Am I a self centered asshole?

To be clear, he was never abusive or neglectful. He was just an arrogant loser who's decisions robbed us of a stable life.",0
"Hey everyone, 

Just got a simple question as I have went through this and am still having troubles. I know I always will, but the days as of late have been very dark. 

Short story: Dad died suddenly when I was 18. Had heart surgery 3 years prior. It was like a sextuple or 6 bypass I believe. He was a very lucky guy. He delivered trucks for Ford and traveled up to Iowa(I live in Missouri) and passed away in his truck. I found out while I was at college 3 hours from home and drove back immediately. Since then I have had no care for anything and I myself have changed.

Had a GF for 4 years, but that no longer exists and any friends I used to have don't talk to me anymore I have pushed away. I won't talk to my mom about it because let's be honest it just isn't the same. I'm very stubborn I know, but I also don't really want to see a councilor(spelling?) because I don't want someone to pretend to care about my situation. I want them to actually relate with me and give me advice or something. I'm not very tolerant of other people and by that I guess I don't sympathize very well. I have a hard time feeling anything especially sympathy and I hate it. For example, someone asks me to say something nice about them and I would say, ""My opinion shouldn't matter. The only thought that should matter is that of yourself."" Now, I completely agree with that for the most part, but I used to never do things like that. I would be the guy that would like and make a person feel good about themselves. I miss that guy. That guy had a willpower to want to be better. 

So, redditors or anyone really, share your story with me, or give me some advice on how to get better than I am currently.",0

"Hey guys, I just found out that my father (45) has to get bypass surgery done. They caught it early and the doctor says everything should be fine. He's healthy, works out regularly (work requirement) and eats fairly healthy thanks to my stepmom (she's a nurse). My grandfather had to get a quadruple bypass done in his 60's before we lost him. So what can I as a 24 year old guy do to mitigate my risk as much as possible since I definitely have a family history of heart disease. ",0

"So i am 24 years old, healthy, it's not courant in my family but sometimes rarely when i am in my bubble this comes up in my mind and i get a small bubble in my stomach thinking about it.

I was wondering if you guys get this thought sometimes.",0

"My father is dying of cancer. I read before about someone recording / taking note of all the questions and answers as a keepsake and figured I'd do the same.

He's not a well man. It's been a slow downhill slope since losing the last of his sight 16 years ago,then diabetes, then heart attack etc. I'm 27m and the eldest of 3. He survived one major operation but it's spread and he's been given 6months-2 years to live - but obviously with Covid going on and him being in crap health in the first place I don't expect him to make it that long. I live abroad (although not very far) and obviously there's a possibility I won't get to see him in person again.

Tbh I'm just rambling here, I don't feel anything yet nor did I when he told me. I just know either way I've got to be strong enough to look after mum. And obviously I don't want to ask him anything too harsh or upsetting to make things harder for him than they already are.


TL;DR:
So anyway my questions so far are:

- what would you have asked your father if you could have before he died?
- would you be willing to walk <my gf> down the aisle?
- is there anything you would have done differently?
- what can I do to best look after mum?
- what do you consider your best qualities?
- what do you consider your worst qualities?
- what would you say to your grandchildren when they're older?
- what could I have done to have been a better son?

Edit - just to say thanks for all of the amazing responses guys. I'm trying to make a mega list and I'm not even halfway through yet :)",0
"I just back from dinner with my parents and it was sobering. For my whole life, my dad was a fit and healthy guy who regularly ran 10ks and excersized daily. That's to say he never had a ""gut"" before. Now he does. It looks like he hasn't excersized in weeks and the end of his belly hangs over his belt slightly now. The whole paternal side of my family struggles with diabetes, but my dad was always on top of it, he went on a severely low carb diet at the age of 25, worked out daily, etc. Now it just seems like he has stopped trying. This is all fine, he can do whatever he wants, he's an adult. He's also turning 70 this year. My grandfather died at the age of 45 from a heart attack, my oldest uncle died at 78 from a heart attack, my second oldest uncle has had 4 heart attacks and is now 76. All with diabetes. I'm increasingly worried that my dad is only a few years away from his first and possibly last heart attack. He was diagnosed 4 years ago with pre-diabetes and likely has it now. 

We were never close when I was a kid, he travelled a lot for work. And now that he is finally not travelling because of covid, I am in school full time and work a 20 hour week on the side. I'm freaking out. I know so little about him and he'll be gone soon. 

I only have a few close friends, but not really anyone I can talk to about this. All of my friends parents are in their early 50s. How do I come to terms with a father that probably wont see me reach my mid 20s?",0
"My father is 70 next year, always been close. However with is age he's starting to have major health problems, two tumours and most likely pre diabetic (even though he is a nurse, and as most males do he ignores it, and he knows better).

I have asked him is the past what's going on, to just be brushed off with a "" oh it's nothing"" or ""it's under control"" clearly isn't. He does the same when my sister asks him questions. Yet every now and then I get little bits of second hand info. That's how I found out about his tumours. I didn't even know he had a heart attack, till two days later, when his brother called me, it was his second and I never knew about the first one.

Now I realise part of it stems from him beingy father and always seeing me as his little boy, not a grown man. Along with not wanting to worry me, but it honestly makes it worse, and O would love to have a open discussion with him and my sister about it, so we know what's going on.

Tldr:
Father is very secretive about health issues and I want to know what's going on so I can help him and be there for him.",0
"I am a 42/m happy married guy.  I grew up in a household where my mother and father would routinely scare the shit out of me, but in a funny way.  My father with steak knives taped to his fingers or ketchup subbing for blood.  My wife has come to embrace this, but I'm stumped this Halloween.

Last year, I got a bunch of ground beef and stuck my hand in it, soaked my face in grenadine (looks like blood and provides the off putting sticky texture).  I just bashed open my front door acting like the ground beef was 'the Blob', screaming like I was dying.  Worked like a charm.

I need something a little lighter this year (in respect to all the crap going on).  Anyone got any clues?  I always loved scary pranks as a kid, but I think I've exhausted my arsenal.  All in good humor.  My wife is my age too, and I don't want to give her a heart attack.  More laughter at the end of the day.  Not genuinely horrifying.",0
"\*Backstory\*

I got recently into highschool (I still don't know if I should post this but here),I've met a guy named Jacob,he is a cheerful and happy person.We would hang out after our class's and he seemed pretty chill.We recently got into E-learning,Jacob after the lessons would go ride with his dad on their Quad every single time.

So,three days ago I've heard from my aunt,who lives in the same city as Jacob,told me that his father was dying from heart attack on Jacob's eyes.Firefighers,emergency services and even air ambulance services were called to help his father,but doctors later deduced that he's dead. Today I've got the call from my aunt that Jacob is literally ""fucked up"",he doesn't sleep,he's crying all the time,he's in total shock. In two days I'm going with my other friend as class's representatives to his dad's funeral,I'll have a chance to talk to him for a bit,but I'm a little bit scared,I don't want to hurt him more or say anything wrong,so please men,can you help me with this one ?

\[EDIT:So today I found out that politicians in my country (I live in Poland,and tbh. things happening in here are really bad) decided that only five people can be on the funeral,twenty people if family is bigger and probably ten or fifteen people can be in church,this church is pretty small so I'm not really surprised,I'm really thankful to you,who commented this post,I'll save it if someone's going to need help with things like this too (I hope you won't tho).\]",0
"I love my partner very dearly, and this only comes from a place of concern. Physically, he looks great! He’s very muscular, is not obese, and I find him very attractive. However, after a year of living together I am growing concerned about his eating habits. 

He never seems to gain any serious weight from it, but the first five months we lived together I gained 40lbs (which I have lost now) from eating his cooking and along with him when he went out to eat. The only things he’ll eat most days, unless I’m there to cook for him, are soda, chips, and steaks. This man loves his red meat, and it is not uncommon for him to eat it multiple times a day and STILL wake up around 1AM and throw another steak on the grill. I cannot seem to get him to eat any fruits or vegetables, and he claims to get his nutrients from “fruit juice” and vitamin water which I have explained is terrible for him! Even if I can get him to eat vegetables, I have to prepare them or he’ll drown them in butter and oil while sautéing them. 

He’s in his early 20’s, so this hasn’t caused his blood pressure to soar yet but I am concerned about him. He’s been hinting at an engagement soon, and I love him dearly and don’t want my future husband to have a heart attack at 43 years old! I cook for him usually 3-4 times a week, and am unsure how to motivate him to eat more fruits/vegetables/lean meat.

"Hi,

I'm 5'4"" and I weigh 128 lbs (58 kg). I'm also a 20 year old girl. My measurements are 38"", 27"", and 39"" (bust, waist, hip).

I never thought I was overweight and at risk of dying until recently. My dad had been shocked when he heard how much I weighed (128 lbs). My brother is around 6 ft and he only weighs 15 lbs more than me. He was joking about how we're like 10 inches apart but I weigh the same as him. My dad joined in and said I need to take care of my health. My ex boyfriend used to also say that girls should be under a 100 lbs. 

All the guys that are really close to me (dad, brother, ex-boyfriend) have been telling me I'm going to die of a heart attack. I don't want to be unhealthy but even my doctor said I was perfectly normal. All my friends at school tell me I have a beautiful body and compliment me constantly but that could be them just being nice. I would believe my dad and brother and take their advice but they sometimes like to get me down and hurt me so I don't trust them wholeheartedly.

Do you guys think I'm at an unhealthy weight and need to get it under control?

My 5 year old and 13 year old boys were there playing video games while she laid down in bed not feeling well and had a heart attack apparently. Doctors said she went 45 minutes plus without oxygen to her brain. My 13 year old said that the little one came and said that Mum won't wake up. Her parents are acting like i murdered her and swept my children to their house. Her family is huge and I have none. They were my Family. They are telling me that we were separated and it doesn't matter how long. I was a stay at home dad and also worked nights in the family business. I have a Legal Aid lawyer but they have said i need a private bar lawyer to pursue property issues. I have no money for that. They went into my house and took all the legal documents and jewelry. They took her phone and read all of our intimate text messages. I have had a complete mental breakdown and have so far left my children with them as not to upset them any further and have been dealing with this solely by Myself. How can people be like this regardless of their opinion of our life. We were happy and did it on our own. Just trying to type this out and maybe see what anyone else has to say. I am so confused and broken. Why do these people think my children should lose both parents because we were in a deep argument. 16 years, 10 months and 30 days we were together. House paid off. We must have been doing something right but not according to these people. I am no perfect angel but my heart has always been in the right place. They are very wealthy. All of a sudden my Daughter wont take the phone to speak to me which was a complete surprise yesterday. We did family hugs and said i love you daily. I have always been there and been over the top protective. If they had a problem with my parenting why have they never said it before and now tell me they are ""protecting"" them? I was always a good loving Dad. I am so worried about my children these people are not what my kids need. they need to be with me. They have been with me their entire lives and now this? How can they do this? I miss her so much. I want to comfort my children. They told me to get my ""stuff"" together and in the future I can be the Dad again and they will be the Grandparents. Wth?

"Just curious to hear other guys' stories.

I used to be a fitness nut. I competed in powerlifting at a solid 220 lbs and was seriously training for a bodybuilding competition. Lifted 6 days a week, ate painfully clean, the works. Then I had a severe back injury, aggravated an existing herniated disc. I couldn't lift at all, then I still couldn't lift the way I wanted to, and completely lost all motivation to do anything. I gained a lot of weight and developed severe sleep apnea, which made a comeback even less likely. 

I had a wake-up call this year when I tried to donate blood 3 times and I couldn't because my resting heart rate was over 100 each time. I made excuses the first 2 times (stress, too match caffeine) but couldn't deny I had a problem after 3 times. Weighed myself for the first time in over a year and was shocked to find I was 300 lbs. I took a good look in the mirror and was disgusted with what I saw. I took down all my old pictures because I couldn't bear to look at them anymore.

I'm on the comeback train now, got a CPAP machine, eating strict keto, and seeing a personal trainer. I don't feel the need to be that big and strong anymore, but I don't want to have a heart attack at 31. Down 15 pounds already and really trying to make this comeback stick.

Anyway, he was my best friend, and we had plans that we couldn't get through. But since I saw his body in the hospital like 9-10 hours ago I haven't felt too down. Mostly shock. 

At the hospital I was there with his parents and siblings, we just reminisced and told stories and laughed. 

I've barely cried at all, a tiny bit when I first saw him and then again when my aunt, step mom and I went to break the news to my younger brother. I've mostly been in shock but now I've gotten time to really grasp the reality of the situation but I'm still just a bit sad and nothing more.

Idk how common that is, I mean I loved so much and we've always had a great relationship so idk why I'm taking this so well. I know for some people it can take days or even months before they can start to grief but I feel like I should at least feel something.

The problem is a lot of my anxiety stems from gut issues I have and the random pains they create in my chest. And everything was magnified after my father had a heart attack and a round of sickness for me.

Furthermore, being alone for an extended period of time ratchets my anxiety up a couple of magnitudes. I rent from my parents, and they've gone 600 miles away for the week. So I'm by myself, which I don't like in the first place. 

The meds and talking about my anxiety seem to help, but what else can I do to help myself. I am seeing a GI doc to try getting my gut under control. But what else can I be doing?

We weren't close, but my mum and my uncle Tony (who is visiting us)  are obviously really upset over the sudden loss of their brother. 

I'm not crying, but I feel like I ought be. Worse though, I don't feel the need to cry. I've always taken maybe a bit too pragmatic view when it comes to death - it's something that happens to everyone and it sucks whether you knew it wasn't coming or whether it's unexpected, like it was with my uncle. Ordinarily, I wear my heart on my sleeve and am generally the most openly emotional member of my family. But I just can't seem to have any kind of reaction to this news and I'm not comfortable with how that makes me feel. Am I just a fundamentally bad person to be so accepting of it? 

I've obviously encountered death before, but... I've always just been a bit numb and removed from grieving. I try to keep people in my memory and remember the influence they've had on me, however big or small. 

What have your reactions been to death? ",0
When I started college I was enrolled in a honors  program and have a promising future. We’ll after the second semester of college my mother died from a heart attack and ever since then school has been struggle. I was just coasting by until the school put me on probation and then eventually I flunked out. Instead of graduating possibly in three years I might graduate in six. I’m doing my best to work through it but man o man it is humiliating.  Letting my father down and my friends and family relatives continually asking when I’m graduating. It tough. I ask how do I deal with humility and move on? I haven’t told a lot of my friends. It’s unfortunately change my mood to things I’m more negative and lazy. I’m just stuck in a tough place.,0
"I had a work ""friend"" who was funny/also weird and didn't have a lot of friends but I used to hang out with him on occasion.  I eventually became his boss so I stopped hanging out with him completely, and when I transferred to another location I didn't see him again until his going away party.  He moved to the other side of the U.S.

Fast forward a few years later (still haven't seen him, occasional FB comments here and there, not even a text message) and he sends me a FB message asking me to fly out to his wedding next year and be his best man.

Concerns:

- I am getting married myself next year, money will be tight at that point
- I am not close to him anymore, don't even know his intended spouse
- I won't be anywhere near him to help fulfill some of the typical Best Man duties such as throwing a bachelor party

I am typically a tell-it-like-it-is asshole, but this guy has always seemed a little sensitive/desperate for friends, he had a rough year when his mom unexpectedly passed, his intended spouse recently had a heart attack, and I feel like this request is indicative of him not forming very many friends in his new state, so I want to be politely flattered but decline.


What's your best advice on how to let this guy down easy?",0
"I was just wondering how men felt about the whole ""curves are for men. Bones are for dogs"" movement? I ask because recently on my Facebook a parody of the mens dove bodies showed a picture of a muscley man with a six-pack titled 'not attractive'. Next to that was a picture of a chubby guy titled 'attractive'.

The vast majority of women's comments were saying that it's obviously a mis-print. Some commented saying that their man should be fit and being chubby he'll probably have a heart attack.

I'm a girl and I've always found this ""bones are for dogs"" movement to be a little out of hand and often a cover for being unhealthy(in my social group). But why does it seem women have a double standard towards men?",0
"For the longest time, I've hated my dad. Ever since I was a little kid, all he did was let my family suffer. He'd always pick on my mom for being stupid of things and ""useless"" while she worked day and night just to give me and my sisters a happy life. I could tell that she cried in secret daily because she always had a hard time with dad but never admitted it. She would always arrive at 10pm because of the hectic commute only to be greeted by slaps and kicks from my dad because she wasn't able to go home early so she could cook dinner for us. I hated him then and I still hate him now. Growing up seeing my buddies have amazing dads didn't really help me. While their fathers took them camping, hiking or playing sports, I'm busy hiding and crying in my room because my drunk old man would throw vases and plates on the walls. I fought him once and cursed me that no matter what happens I'll end up like him. 

I'm 27 now and currently working with stable income. My father mellowed down because he had 2 heart attacks in a row but he's still an asshole. Even death doesn't want him. We keep it civil now because I don't want to cause my mom a headache.

I'm deciding to marry soon and become a father in a few years. I don't know jack if I became a great man because I never knew what that felt or what a ""man"" should really be. My sob story is over.

So, how are you guys and I'd really like to know how you became a ""man"".",0
"Soo well start off with some back story just so you can get a feel for the situation...

I am 23, never had any serious relationships or any for that matter. I've always been that type of person that laughs makes other people laugh. Always smiling and lightning up the mood, a real comedian you would say.  But for some reason that has only been an outter shell, a coping mechanism. I think I use jokes and laughter and smiles to cover up the loneliness deep down.

I feel very isolated and can't really share my feelings with people. I just feel very vulnerable to the fact that it'll leave me with hurt and emotional I don't need. The only times I ever cry are when someone that I know dies or something severe happens to trigger these emotions. Even though I'm friends with a lot of people, I am also not friends with anyone.

It's like that very popular guy everyone looks up to. I talk and associate with everyone and therfore everyone knows me to be popular. The thing is, I don't have a circle of close friends. I just have a lot of acquaintances you could say. But any time I would go out, I could pick up chick's and get their numbers very easily. I'm a decent looking guy, but I think I have the comedy going for me. All of these girls never led to more than anything but a date.

I never followed through with education after high school and been working ever since. I've worked many different jobs in many different fields, but mostly all Labour and customer service. Finally landed an office job.  Pays really good, but I feel trapped here. It's not what I wanted to do in life.

Anyway, I've never been able to get into any relationships because of these reasons. There are no young girls my age working in factories or that many in full time customer service jobs. Also I don't really go out much because I'm not invited to hang out by anyone. So here it comes full circle, this is where life kicks you in the balls. I met this amazing chick at the office job. Mind you, their cubicles but regardless, for me, it's an office compared to the places I've worked. Anyway long story short, I fell for her.

I fell for her pretty hard. Ever since the first day I started, 3months ago, we just clicked and bonded. We hit it off and flirted all the time. I even lost a bet on purpose to her just so I would have a chance to get her something. I work afternoons and she works nights. So our shifts only overlap for an hour,  mind you that's more than enough for me to get girly butterflies. I literally count down the minutes till she gets there. When she starts work, I start my break at the lunch room and she even comes for my whole break and we just talk and joke. 

So Friday I decided to ask her out. Like this is very first girl, I've emotionally let in and been vulnerable to. I let my guard down and the whole week building up to it, I couldn't eat and had shortness of breath. The whole 9 yards when it comes to having a crush on someone. Come Friday I get her alone during my lunch break but I don't have the courage to ask her. I keep asking what she's doing on Saturday after she's told me she's hanging out with her family. Sunday is the other day she's off but my mind isn't thinking because my heart is using of the blood from keeping me from having a heart attack. She kept looking at me like she knew or anticipated me asking her out. 

So as my break finishes we go back to our desks. Fast forward to the end of my shift, I go to the lunch room and grab my bag and on the way back I make it official to ask her. Nervously I go up to her desk and blurt everything out at the same time. I just came out as ...Sunday...do you wanna get something...eat?

BAM. Waited lifted off my shoulders and for sure all the signs point to her saying yes. No, that's not the case. She looks at my all funny and says maybe she'll see if she's not busy, but gives me her number. Shit, at this point I'm kind of excited and nervous and sad that she didn't say yes but at least gave me her number. 

But when I texted her today, I said ""Hey, Boston pizza today at 12pm"". Now my heart is POUNDING and just waiting for a response. My chest is hurting from my heart beat and I'm getting cold sweats from thinking about our date. But to my surprise she says and I quote...

""I won't be able to make it tomorrow.  I know you have nothing better to do with your life but I'm busy"".

And that's all she wrote. Tore me up with 2 lines. To think, she led me on this whole time and I knew for a fact she used to initiate the flirting. I feel like a complete bag of shit. I even went against my better judgment and let her in which makes this worse.

So guys, how do I handle the situation from here? What do I say to her at work? How do I approach her or do I approach her at all? I'm afraid she might tell people at work as well and make it awkward for me. I'm so confused and hurt and shattered. I've never let this happen before and I think I'm only going to withdraw to myself a bit more. Such is life. Thanks for listening, it feels better just getting it out. And I thought she was into me.


TL/DR Finally fell for a girl for first time and let my guard down. She rejects me via text and shatters my emotions.",0
"I grew up with a high functioning closet alcoholic father. He worked hard during the day and drank himself to sleep every night. He wasn't a raging alcoholic, but his alcoholism definitely affected the way I grew up and has a huge impact on my life. He passed away at the age of 52 from a heart attack (which I strongly believe was brought on by his drinking)

I (30/f) am dating a guy (34/m) who really enjoys drinking. On a weekend night he easily has 2 drinks before we go out, 2 drinks when we're at dinner, and another 2-3 drinks when we go listen to music. Or he'll drink 4 drinks (2 liquor and 2 beers) on a random weekday night when we meet up for drinks and appetizers after work. If we're having a night in, he'll pour himself 2 whiskey and water drinks. We rarely every hang out where he doesn't consume an alcoholic drink. Does this seem concerning? I've talked to him about it and he says that's just what he likes to do. ",0
"I'm going to start from the very beginning, so this might get long.

So, this started a couple of years ago. I was 30, had a nice job that occupied most of my time and mind. I wasn't really interested in having a relationship or even to look out for a woman, I just had a one night stand when I felt the need to. I had just one real relationship, while in University, it lasted barely a year and even if I loved the girl, it made me fell trapped and unhappy, it wasn't something I was willing to experience again in the near future. 

At the time I had no idea how miserable and empty my life was. I thought I had everything I wanted. 
The cherry on top was the promotion I had been working for years, it meant more rewarding work and independence in my daily work life. But the promotion meant way more work too, so my superior thought it would be a good idea to get someone to do basic stuff that would just waste my time. And that was a really good idea, after a while I was feeling overwhelmed, and I couldn't wait for *help* to come. I was expecting a young, male, freshly minted engineer from the local University. Instead I got a 21 yrs old female tech, with little to no experience in the field, that barely spoke our language (but had a perfect english and knew a couple of other languages too). The first time I saw her, I couldn't help but think she must have sucked some very important dicks to get the job. She wasn't Victoria's Secret hot, but was really really pretty, and never passed unnoticed. After expressing my doubts about her to my superior I was told to suck it up and give it a try because she seemed to know her shit pretty well. 

And fuck, he was right. Even just after a couple of weeks I couldn't see myself working without her, I never had to explain things twice, and most of the time she would figure stuff out on her own. She was very professional, never used her big, beautiful dark eyes to get out of trouble (and fuck, I would kill someone if she asked for it with her puppy eyes) or flirted with me to get something. She was also very fun and it was just nice to have her around, she knew so much stuff, always had a good book or movie to recommend. One could feel her passion for everything she liked and did. After a couple of months we were already having coffee in the morning and lunch together. We pretty much passed 10 to 12 hours and 5 days a week together. Day after day I just liked her more. We didn't talk about personal stuff very often, but I knew she was single and was having trouble socializing outside of work. Being practically a socially awkward penguin, I couldn't help her. She knew I was single too, and even made some comments about how it's weird, because I'm handsome and a great guy, I just told her it was a choice.

Then we started travelling for work together, at least a couple of times a month. That's when trouble started. We would be together all day long for three to five days, and I couldn't notice how awesome she was. At the beginning I thought it was just an infatuation. A crush. I would lie to myself, saying it was normal when you pass all this time together, that there were tons of girls like her, I just needed sex. Lies, a bunch of lies.
She was amazing, so smart and funny. Serious when she had too, but never too much. We could talk non stop for a whole 12-hour flight. I never got tired of her, I just wanted more, time with her was never enough. When I was nervous or worried about something she could calm me down and make me think instead of freaking out. 
We ended up sharing an office, so she wouldn't have to run up and down the stair from the cubicles floor to my office. I had her in front of me all day long, and it was the most beautiful thing ever, I loved every single minute of my day with her. When she wasn't there, I could still feel the scent of her perfume and that made me so fucking happy.
I knew that at least 5 or 6 of my colleagues had major crushes on her, but she never agreed to a date with one of them. I never had the heart to ask her if it was because she didn't like them or because she wouldn't date a coworker.

At one point I stopped lying to myself, and just acknowledged that I loved her with all my heart. But having the balls to tell her was a whole lot more than that. 
I was scared that she wasn't this amazing woman, that maybe I was just lonely and ended up idolizing her, and made her look perfect in my head. So I just kept on going with my life, and didn't tell her a thing. Somedays I would feel like shit, because I couldn't stand not having her. Everytime she touched me was both amazing and painful. Somedays I would just hate her, how could she be so oblivious? How could she not notice how much I'm suffering? Why she is so nice to me but never go the extra step?
I didn't say nothing for almost another year. And the only thing that changed is that I loved her even more. Until our last business trip, some weeks ago. 

I just couldn't live like this anymore, so I decided I was going to tell her. I thought about the consequences, if she rejected me, working with her would be a nightmare, but if she had feelings for me I would be the happiest man alive and my life would not be miserable anymore.
So we left for a week long trip overseas, I was more than nervous. She could feel there was something odd, and asked a couple of times if I was feeling ok. I said I was fine, it's just my fear of flying. Yes, I hate flying, I can't feel safe on a metal tube flying thousands of meter up in the air, I just can't. She always holds my hand during take off and landing, and it makes me feel so much better. The week goes on as usual, besides the fact that I'm always thinking about when and how I'll tell her. On the last day the worst fucking idea comes to my mind: I'll write a fucking letter, then give it to her, so I won't have a heart attack while talking to her. 
After we are done with work in the morning, we went to lunch together and I didn't even eat because of how nervous I was. When I got back to my hotel room I wrote the letter, I actually wrote something like 6 or 7 letters before getting it right. The thing is long, to full pages, and my handwriting is small. And I don't know why, but I thought it was a good idea to give her the letter some hours before getting our flight home. I know, I'm an idiot.
So I call her, and ask her if she can come over to pick up something. She comes over, I open the door and the door and give her the letter. She asks what's it. I tell her it's personal, and she fucking opens it right there in front of me. I ask her to please, to go read it in her room. But she doesn't, she gets into my room and starts reading it in front of me. I'm there, sitting in my bed while the love of my live stands in front of me reading everything I had to tell her. She reads the whole thing without saying a word. Nothing. It felt like it took hours for her to read it.

You know how it happens in movies, when the guys tells the girl he loves her, and they kiss and have awesome sex? Yeah, that didn't happen. 
Seeing her smile while reading the letter, made me think that was going to happen, but it didn't. When she finished I got up and she hugged me, gave me a kiss on my chest and went silent. After what felt like eternity, she told me her feelings for me as not nearly as profound as mine for her, told I was a good friend, that she liked me a lot and had to think about this. I was going to cry, I felt the desperate need to cry, and after she left I did, I cried like a fucking child. That was the most physical contact I ever got with her, for a moment it felt like a sneak peak of what I could have with her, but after what she told me it felt like getting stabbed a thousand times.

We took our flight home, it was a night flight. She usually sleeps for the whole flight when we fly at night, but this time she was awake for the whole time. And we exchanged something like 5 work in 10 fucking hours, and it was about the shitty food. 
After that she left for her 2 weeks vacation, she'll be back on monday. I haven't heard from her since that night. I feel like leaving my job and moving to another continent for the shame. I hate myself for putting me, and specially her, in this situation. 


I'm writing this here because my closest male friends are work colleagues, and I don't feel like sharing this with them. But I had to share/talk with other men. I can't be the only stupid fucker that pulled shit like this.

tl;dr: I'm a stupid fucker.",0
"I'm asking AskMen because this extends beyond girls and dating - it's a lifestyle choice.

I've been putting immense pressure on myself to be more masculine since 2015 started. I've been an introverted bookworm/nerd my entire life, and only during the last few months have I realized the incorrectness of such a lifestyle and started questioning and rejecting every way I've done things - how I walk, how I talk, how I project myself, how I THINK, etc. I haven't been happy at all since this realization because I can't stop worrying and overcompensating - but hey, no pain no gain right? These are my most pressing problems:

- only 5'8""

- voice isn't deep enough

- baby face, lacking in facial hair (maybe it has to do with being Asian)

- socially awkward, afraid of interaction

- hobbies are nerdy 

- lacking confidence


If you think about it, how many men these days are alpha, ambitious, unemotional, physically fit, in control of their life circumstances and doing what they want instead of being emotional airbags that sit home and watch TV? I want to put myself on the path to becoming the former. Is that even possible? Are our wills free enough such that we can decide what image we want to project to the world, and ultimately, who we want ourselves to be? Am I not being alpha or masculine just by the fact that I'm analyzing life way too much and being too emotional/philosophical? 

I will do EVERY SINGLE FUCKING THING I can do about my physical appearance. I will lift. I will try to do vocal exercises to make my voice deeper. I will inject testosterone to grow some fucking facial hair so I can be a real man for once, if I have to. 

As for the mental part, I will put myself out there, even if I get near heart attacks from the extent to which I push myself to do things I don't want to do. I will try to distance myself from my emotions and focus on things REAL men focus on, like ambition and control of my circumstances. I have taken measures to make myself appear more assertive, by saying no a lot more often than I used to, and overall just not taking shit from other people.

As for confidence, I will fake it until I make it. I will act unnatural and do uneasy things even if it makes me uncomfortable or unhappy. In theory, at some time in the future I will internalize confidence. 

Anything I'm missing? Masculine men of AskMen, what are your suggestions? This is a very open-ended post, but I really believe I need to put myself on the right path so I end up as one of the alpha men in the world according to the archetype I described above, and not some hopeless beta chump. Unfortunately, the gene pool has decided to make this very hard for me and I'm not sure if it's even possible to measure up (figuratively and literally) in the long run. I am confused, but I want to change.",0
"Long story short, my father died of a heart attack 20 years ago when he was only 38.  Since then, my family has told me that he had the heart attack because he was obese, and I was just a kid when it happened, so I didn't question it.  A few weeks back, my mom let it slip that he had an undiagnosed genetic heart defect that massively increases the chance for sudden cardiac arrest.  I did some research and found that I have a high chance of inheriting the condition from him and have already scheduled a doctors appointment to run some tests.  When I asked my mom why she kept information this important from me for pretty much my whole life, she said that she ""didn't want me to worry about it"".  This isn't the first time my family has kept me in the dark about serious medical issues in my family.  Within the past 2 years, my grandfather, uncle, and brother have all been in the hospital for serious medical issues, and nobody called me to let me know what was going on.  I'll only find out at family gatherings when someone lets it slip, and starts a huge argument because I just found out about it.  It's not because I don't talk to my family regularly.  I talk to my mother weekly, and my grandmother monthly and they purposefully keep these things from me because they ""don't want me to worry"".

"24 never had a girlfriend before (put a fucking bullet in my head)

I'm scared, because I know that when i finally get a girlfreind if she will stay with me for long enough I'm going to buy her a ring, I know me and as much as I dont want to be one of those guys that settles for the first girl to come along I know I will.

The problem is that any girl I meet is going to have WAY more sexual experiance then me and that is going to make me bitter and unable to handle it

(unless I meet another virgin, but that is 99.99% not going to happen)

Of course I know my first relationship will probably fail, but its going to hurt so much, and feel like a waste of time (i know that the whole time thing is usually more of a factor for women then men, but still, i could die of a heart attack at 45 who knows?)

I want as much time with the woman I'm going to be with as I can possibly have.

have any of you had this mindset? did it change once you figured out how to start dating?

"Hey /r/askmen,

I have a good friend who is in his late 40s. Over the last year he's been in full-on midlife crisis mode. He had an emotional affair with a younger woman (wife found out, didn't leave him). He started smoking again. He started drinking voluminously. He has put on abdominal fat. He used to walk every day now he does nothing. He's being treated for depression.

All he wants to do is play music (great!) or sit around smoking / drinking while talking about the younger girl (less great). I'm worried about him, especially with the recent death of James Gandolfinni, who is only a little bit older. My buddy's dad died of a heart attack.

I've asked him to go for runs with me, but I think maybe that's too much for him and his pride is preventing him from trying. He's in a bad way, financially, right now, so going to the gym isn't an option. I thought maybe of asking him to go for walks, but honestly I don't know how to do that without it seeming super awkward.

Maybe I just level with him? I'm in my early 30s and all my friends are pretty fit, so I've never had to do this before. Any advice from others who have been in this situation on either side?

Any advice is appreciated. I worry about the guy.

"I'm still friends with my ex that I lived with for almost five years, and known as a good friend for more than ten.

Now, he has been experiencing heart problems and is going to try to quit drinking on his own. He has always flat out refused to see any doctor, and I'm not sure if he has insurance, but he has a good job.  To paint a picture, he is 39, lifetime heavy smoker, drinks 10-12 drinks a day and eats only pizza, tacos and junk food.

"[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xx2fh/my_boyfriend_and_i_have_been_dating_for_a_little/). 

So, way to give me a heart attack guys. I talked to him about the whole thing and he said he'd wait. I didn't beg him. I didn't guilt him into it. I said, ""boyfriend, what exactly happens to us when you go off to university?"" and he said, ""well, eatmanydicksfeelings, I don't know. What do you want to happen?"" and I said, ""I want to be in a relationship with you, but I understand you don't want something long distance."" and he said, ""I want a relationship with you too, so if this is something you want, then I will talk to you the majority of every week, and we can continue to be friends blah blah blah and if you are comfortable with not actively searching for other guys to fuck and date while I'm away, then I will do the same and we can see what happens with us when winter break comes around"". 

Or something like that. 

After he said that, I told him I was worried that maybe he just didn't want a long distance relationship because he wanted to chase after college girls and he laughed and said, ""you've been looking on the Internet, haven't you?""

"I matched with girl on tinder who is quite average looking but has some nice big funbags. I managed to charm her enough to text me the same night. The conversation went from match to talking over text 20 minutes later to explicit texts describing what we would do to one another sexually.
The same happened last night and tonight we are meeting when I get out of work. Im afraid that I will either blow it, or that shes super ugly or smells or something. We are planning on fucking and I feel like I am in a situation where I cannot pass on sex.
Id consider myself an attractive guy so Im not worried that she wont like me (but who knows maybe she wont) im more worried that I will be repulsed by sex with her and be trapped. What are some ways to bail last minute without crushing her?

To be clear, as of right now, I have every intention of bending her over her bed (where I am meeting her) She seems great and we have a lot in common. Im just kind of iffie on her appearance bc she doesnt have pictures that really give any inshight into her body

Update: landed the pussy- holy shit

So we went out for a quick dinner and went to her place and immediately got into. She smelled great, had a decent body, amazing pierced huge tits. Dinner was good.- little awkward at first but I made it not so. After we left she invited me into her CLEAN apartment. She started showing me around and my heart was beating so hard that I couldn't even hear what she was saying so I just picked her up and threw her on her bed. I could tell that she wasn't very experienced. Don't have her last name but she claims she was 21. I took her shirt off and out popped a couple of perfect plump tits busting out of her brah. I jumped up, shut the light off took off my shirt and kissed her neck. She was super sensitive to my touch and lips and squirmed at every move I made. I unzipped her pants, threw her legs behind her back kissed her thighs to make sure I wasn't going into a sewer, once nostrils gave me the all clear, I decided to get a little closer but went back up slowly to her pierced nipples and removed her brah. I played with them for like 5 minutes and made my way back down south. I shoved her red panties to the side and went in for the kill. I attacked her viciously with my mouth and had her legs wrapped around the back of my neck while I penetrated her with my tongue. I played with her tits a little more and took my pants off. I kind of had to lead her along and told her forcefully to get down there and suck my dick. she told me she had never done it before and I said ya whatever that's fine. Well her teeth got in the way but I sat up with my legs straight up while she looked up at my (she kept her glasses on btw) and stuffed her mouth with my man meat laying on her stomach like a school girl studying in her bed. 

I was smart enough to throw on a rubber and threw her on her back again and pounded her out for about an hour and went through a few condoms so she could suck me off in between. Finally after building a good sweat up, I busted a big load into her (with a condom on) and called it a night. We fooled around for a few
Minutes and I was on my way. Here I am on my way home. Fully satisfied

"Sorry if this waffles or isn't well structured, I'll try to tidy at a later date. 

Not sure what to say. 21M AFC with SOCIAL ANXIETY, problems just talking to girls my age. Generally don't trust them. Convinced that they find me a pathetic loser frankly, especially the typical 'alpha female'. Only girl I've felt a truly contradictory experience to this assumption with was my ex, who once claimed to love me but MAY have fell for another guy, someone more 'alpha' by my book. I don't know. 

The reasons I think women think I'm this pathetic loser (how do you bold btw?)

1) I have an ANXIETY DISORDER and DEPRESSIVE TENDENCIES; the diagnosis was a blow to my manhood to be honest. The whole 'BIG BOYS DON'T CRY' thing that one circle of friends subscribes to. Being into fitness and self-improvement, big fucking impassable mental barriers in the way of being successful were destroying me.

2) This makes me a bit of a NERVOUS WRECK at times and SUSPICIOUS/PARANOID of people in general 

3) Well ok, I've been like that for years because I got BULLIED throughout school for being 'different'. I've got a LEARNING DISABILITY (Dyspraxia), in school I should have technically been in the year below me in terms of physical and emotional maturity but I busted my ass off to be an equal and actually I was apparently a real Alpha for a 15 yo, lol. Alpha in the good way-fit, intelligent, ambitious, successful, interesting, talented, seeking to better the world and serve others

4) Oh and they also bullied me because I was a FORMER FAT KID (but I lost the weight in Year 8, albeit had body image insecurities and obsessions with appearance every since)

5) It means I DON'T DO DEM MANLY THINGS LIKE DRINKING because it spikes paranoia of the ""stop bitching about me!"" ""no-one said anything...""'variety. I got a lot of stick with my guy friends for what should have even a very simple lifestyle change, until I got out of high school sobriety made me some social pariah.

6) Actually to  be honest I need an early night to think straight and not be a nervous wreck/BROODY BUGGER I THINK/RUMINATE A LOT 

7) ...coffee gives me the JITTERS so I drink green tea. REAL PARTY ANIMAL here!

8) I've had INSOMNIA for years, it's really effing annoying. It has got better in the last year, especially since I restarted exercise and cut down on caffeine, but then I've been giving much less of a fuck for the last year about the stuff that matters and too much about what doesn't. 

9) Despite being sleep deprived, I feel like I should 'MAN UP' and soldier on through the tiredness/be outgoing and stay out late when I don't always have the energy, rather than get early nights. There is no such thing as a tired young man, don't be lazy, sleep is for the weak, etc. This leads to situations where I deliberately stay up late to make myself sleep deprived, triggering my health anxiety while also worsening my mental state in the name of 'manning up'. I basically did a degree sleep deprived

10) Nor did I lift; a psychosomatic FEAR OF HAVING A HEART CONDITION kept me out of the gym for 2 years, losing my decent physique in the process to be replaced with 'skinny-fat' (because I kept up  basic cardio like walking at least). Technically I have a benign heart condition actually

11) So I'm kinda SKINNY at present which makes me internally bitch about all the hot alphas having all the luck. I'm hitting the gym, the barrier is the thoughts of ""Omg I'm under the bench press I can hear my heart pumping I'M DYING HELLLLLLP"" that run through my head when I go. However I seem to be moving more to slim/lean which is good.

12) Because of the psychosomatic heart condition phobia I became quite a HEALTH NUT, it was akin to an EATING DISORDER (?) in the way it negatively affected my life. It WORRIED MY FAMILY a lot, and upset my mum whenever I wouldn't eat dessert or mentioned going to the gym. She wound up on antidepressants (but it turned out that was because she hated her job and I seemed very stressed and unhappy, NOT because I wasnt eating much cake lol) 
It has took a long time, 4 years to be precise, to not feel that I obsessively have to have them watch me eat chocolate every day or get permission to go the gym every damn time. I only realised I'd lost touch with reality when one day I asked my mum 'permission' to masturbate. I'm still working on it. THINK I HAVE TO BE FATTER AGAIN (PUT ON WEIGHT, EAT MORE CAKE, RAISE BODY FAT%) TO MAKE MUM HAPPY
So I am a bit 'scared' of my parents/extended family in that regard, I want to please them but to do so would be to forfeit my own goals. Sometimes, these goals are really basic: for example I have to 'please' Dad by having a lot of cake right before bed even though that historically triggers sleep difficulties, or by eating granola for him when it lowers my testosterone levels, etc.

13) Came back from GP with normal yet low-ish testosterone prior to restarting lifting. No hot early twenties femme wants a guy with LOW T for Christ's sake

13) Sometimes I feel like I'm LETTING MY DAD DOWN BY NOT HAVING LOWER TESTOSTERONE (?) levels and actively try to lower them by binge eating…apparently this is quite an unusual thought process? I think he would prefer me to be a bit chubbier, and have a higher-pitched voice, and perhaps have weaker erections, but I'd rather he's not thinking about that. This is especially true since his SO is, er…a bit on the heavy side.  lovely woman, step mum soon enough I'm sure, and vegetarian, but not my physical type. And no I am NOT a troll, I am a little crazy

14) Well I've been SCARED OF MY MUM AND SISTER for years, they're both controlling and my sister is very dominant. MUM MAY HAVE CHEATED ON DAD, to this day I do not know nor am I sure I want to. Basically I lived at home with anxiety getting WHIPPED by an overprotective mother with passive aggressive tendencies and a dominating sister, having lost my father figure who was kicked out of the house and forced to go into 2 jobs to pay off the equity split Mum received for 'the kids' (this is money I never saw btw). Despite everything I don't hate my mother, who has anxiety and panic attacks too, I just can't always fully trust her. 

15) BUT THE DIVORCE WAS 5 YEARS AGO, my mum's been remarried 2 years and my dad seeing someone for 3. So I'm not sure whether it's just becoming a SCAPEGOAT (?) to blame for my problems instead of facing situations I often created myself through maladaptive coping strategies for anxiety (such as, perhaps, long questions to Internet forums in the dead of night? Hmm) 
Despite this I can't deny DIVORCE HAS JADED MY VIEW on love and companionship with the opposite sex.

16) I'm a VIRGIN. This is a no-brainer for why it makes me insecure. I take the attitude that most college girls have already been in a few relationships, had their heart broken and broke someone's heart. They've been around the block, and they see me as this sweet innocent thing. A bit like I am the virgin to deflower, except they won't (because they think I'm a loser) so instead they patronise me

 17) By now you should have noticed I'm currently HOPELESSLY NEUROTIC? I don't have much to talk about; this never used to be a problem though, and I'm good at bullshitting my way through conversations with people despite it

18) I CAN'T DRIVE

19) I CAN'T COOK MUCH (yet…I can make a decent chilli con carne and omelette I guess?) 

20) Since I've only just graduated, I have NO FULL TIME JOB NOR CERTAIN CAREER PATH

21) I feel I'm TOO SENSITIVE/EMOTIONAL (?). 'Big boys don't cry', 'don't be needy' etc.

22) Finally, a SELF-FULFILLING PROOPHECY: I'm afraid of women so I think women are laughing at me, so I'm scared to talk to them…so they think I'm pathetic and laugh…over and over...


I find a lot of my guy friends in the 'big boys don't cry' circle  talk quite disparagingly of women at the pub, trying to one-up each other with how many they've pegged. One of these friends-let's call him Bill-is ALWAYS sneaking in a story about this girl who liked him but he found annoying because she wouldn't leave him all night, or these girl who he just casually ended up having threesomes with, or his crazy ex girlfriends etc. Sometimes I think Bill's making it up or exaggerating to cover up some insecurities. He's not the stereotypical alpha male, he's pretty skinny. What Bill is, however, is intelligent, well versed in pop-culture, can play the guitar (or did a few years ago anyway) and charismatic-boy can he talk. 

Despite Bill's low opinion on females, he recently had 120 Likes for his Just Graduated Facebook status of which about 80 were from -of which at least half were very attractive to me. I did the same thing and I got about 20, most of which were close friends and family, some I'm convinced were pity likes. Essentially I threw away a lot of my social life for uni due to my problems, spoke to only a handful of girls, and the only one I made a lasting friendship with became my SO became my ""let's be friends"" ex became not in my life. Or in other words: I now have no female friends because I'm scared of women and have some rather fucked up views on relationships. I'm embarrassed of the lack of female friends, and concerned by the latter reasons for this.

This begs the question: SHOULD I BE MORE LIKE BILL TO GET SUCCESS? I don't even mean get laid, I mean not bore a girl away. Thing is our moral/philsophical compasses are polar opposites

-he's atheist and mocks religion, I'm a former Christian current agnostic
-he's liberal, I'm conservative
- he's done loads of drugs at uni, smoked and binge drinks, that's all a bad idea for me with my mental health and hypochondria
-he does his best to be a macho man and one of the guys, I'm the more sensitive and introspective type (or 'introverted beta' if you really have to categorise me) 

He's talking about having pulled +50 throughout university, yet I just can't get my head around the idea of a one night stand and only had one (albeit serious) relationship. How you can convince someone to be comfortable enough to let you stick your dick in their vagina and NOT develop some sort of emotional connection is beyond me. Personally I don't trust myself with my dick a lot of the time, let alone anyone else. It's one of the main reasons I'm a virgin and deliberately avoided my issues around women for a long time-but I'm 21 now, my track record for uni is DIRE (I've been depressed by my anxiety issues and lived at home,) 


Now a lot of this could be pure PARANOIA, as I get the SAME FEELINGS WITH LADS talking about me when I leave, laughing. Most of the reasons I think people would laugh seem to be with me NOT BEING 'ONE OF THE GUYS', the reasons listed above. 


Apologies for the length of that. That was a hell of a lot. 


Tl; dr I think girls  are laughing at me or regard me as a child because I have a mental illness and learning disability, both of which make me 

a) more socially awkward than the average guy in university (but yeah college for all you folks in America)

b) prone to hypersensitivity and extreme emotional reactions which mean that I have to live a somewhat more mature, laid back and 'responsible' (boring?) lifestyle. I'm at the age the girls want to party hard and get laid with every hot guy under the sun and I just want to go to the movies or a gig or something and save my affections for that someone special. I'm loathe to say 'The One' as my ex was in hindsight a case of Oneitis 

c) no manly man, I'm a geeky virgin New Age Sensitive Guy who likes the Disney Renaissance, intellectual debate and musicals among other things, but happens to like to lift 

There should be no reason to feel so insecure and self-deprecating: I'm a reasonably fit, intelligent and hard-working guy with a degree under my belt, a part-time job, musically talented, and I have some experience with acting/musical theatre. I've also been told I have 'a way with words' when I want to, narrating a novel at public recitals, creative writing/poetry/song-writing and so on. That probably didn't come out in this, this is way wayyy too long, but my anxiety has made me more desperate.

So my questions are: 

1) How do I convince myself women are NOT laughing at me or inclined to condescend me? 

2) Failing that, how do I just not care what they think? 

3) Is there a way I can change and be more like Bill to get success, without compromising on my moral code? (That is, I would hate to be 'pumped and dumped' so I refuse to do the same to a woman)

4) Is there something very wrong with me, or have I just skipped the commitment-phobic bachelor phase? ",0
"A few weeks ago I had surgery and now have to go through physical rehab. During said rehab I'm going to have what amounts to a portable EKG done on a regular basis. The problem is that I'm a relatively hairy guy and the electrodes just love to grab as much hair as they can.

"30/M here. My Dad (58/M) died earlier this month due to COVID. It's come as a shock to us all as he had no underlying health conditions and we fully expected him to make a full recovery when he first contracted the virus. Unfortunately the virus did a number on him and the damage to his lungs was extensive and irreparable. Towards the end, he was in intensive care and on a ventilator. It got to the point where the ventilator was artificially prolonging his life and the risk of cardiac arrest was growing each day. My family and I made the difficult decision to withdraw life support and let him pass peacefully without any suffering.

I am struggling to comprehend his passing if I can be honest. His decline was rapid and my memories of him prior to testing positive are very fresh in my mind. It almost feels like this is all a dream and at any moment I'm going wake up to the real world where my Dad is still alive.

I'm struggling to adapt to this new chapter in my life. I know it's only been 10 or so days since he passed, but I just don't see how I'll get over this.

Does this get any easier? Does the pain go away? I can't begin to describe how much I miss the old man.",0
"TL:DR-nephew has Down's syndrome, went in for mitral valve replacement. Doctors shocked to see his valve is practically non existent, no idea how he's been going in.

Mom couldn't come, I think she would break down. I told my wife not to come, she lost a brother a decade ago and I think it would bring up similar memories (she's pregnant and I don't want to risk anything with the baby).

"Brief back story: 


Youngest of four. 25 y.o. Live at home because my parents are semi-OK with it, and I have career goals. Family communication structure is passive-aggressive/dismissive. Currently have an alcoholic father who is in his 60's, with several cardiac risk factors.


I suspect my father is suffering from  disease, with rivalling apathy. I will be gone and very busy in one year (medschool application process going well). I have encouraged AA, accompanied him to meetings, had encouraging discussion, and toted reform of diet, etc. to no avail. My mother has harped this sentiment of change for years, and at this point accepts ""the incorrigible behaviors of a suicidal man."" 


Passive/dismissive/egocentric behaviors from siblings... He has moments of clarity, like others suffering from alcoholism, with the quick relapses. What to do? Time to move on? How do I establish influence with him, and the others, to promote good communication toward wellness, and a healthier family infrastructure, given my position as the youngest son?

"Serious question, and situation. I'm 42, and I'm tired. Almost all the time. I'll summarize what could be contributing, and what I've tried to boost my energy level.

Contributing factors: 2 young children, desk job (a job I love, interesting and generally low stress with regular hours), over weight (but lost 15lbs this year), sleep apnea, limit exercise.

Stuff I've done: Getting 7-8 hours of sleep, occasionally interrupted by kids, eating healthier (lots of protein and fruit, some vegis), CPAP for sleep apnea, losing weight (15 lost, 45 to go), getting some exercise (walking, some biking and swimming, 20-40 pushups most days), cutting back on sugar and junk food. Thyroid tested, ok. Blood tested, ok except good cholesterol is a little low and bad variety is a little high. Generally healthy in terms of colds and stuff. I'm still freakin' tired.

Other stuff: I don't do caffeine, other than what's in the occasional chocolate. 1 or 2 drinks a month. No smoking or recreational drugs.

I've heard that men often get tired in their 40s, and hoping some of your fine gentlemen will have suggestions on how I can boost my energy.

"I just thought about this while eating a prime rib sandwich 1) by myself 2) at a bar. I used to wait tables, and it was pretty much a guarantee that the guy would get the burger (or its equivalent), and the gal would get some form of vegetable. 

Now, I *totally* order salads all the time, not because I give a shit (I'm a woman, I'm married, have stretch marks, etc, etc), but because I just don't feel inclined to eat all those lipids. However, when I'm with a group, and I do order heftier fare, the guys are always like, ""Duuuude, nice, way to go!"" 

But thinking back on all those orders I've taken, I just wonder if those women were fucking hungry but too wuss to eat any damn meat in front of a man. 

Does it matter?

Edit - Cool. Thanks. Ladies, if you want a burger, don't not order a burger because you think the guy gives a shit. Don't order it because you're thinking of your cholesterol levels or some boring shit like that. ",0

"Hello. There is a current situation portion, struggle portion, and question portion for those kind to respond.

*Current situation portion*

I am a 25F and my father is dying. He has been diagnosed chronic heart failure, and was already in a sedated state with a many tubes by the time we reached the ICU on Friday evening. He won't wake up anymore, and he won't recover speaking or facial expression functions even if we discontinued medication. I have been back in my home country last December after six years studying and working abroad. My younger brother is still abroad right now, pending visa application after he graduated from university, and can't take a flight back immediately. I met two step-sisters from dad's first marriage who are at least 22 years older than me -- I know very little about them.

*Struggle portion*

My parents had a nasty divorce that was only concluded recently in 2016, and I feel so uncomfortable seeing father now with my mother also there. I don't understand what she is feeling, and being the biggest source of pain, pessimism and reason of low self-esteem for me in the past years, I struggle to sympathise with her. Her and my brother's anger throughout the years towards daddy made me feel guilty for moving forward with my forgiveness, and like I was betraying them if I expressed my love even though I really wanted to + had always been compatible and close to him. We are in day 2 here. After our second medical update and advice from the doctor, I was just standing by the wall, crying for minutes. My mum walked over to me after a while, tried to hold my folded arms firmly, and looked into my eyes as though she wanted to give me support. I started to cry more calmly because it was too odd -- I never would ask my mother for reassurance, and I couldn't read her emotions (i.e. what did she think she was conveying with this.) Then she pulled me into an embrace, perhaps trying to comfort me, when she started to cry too. My mum never hugs me. When she started crying, I froze and became quiet. I couldn't cry...I don't know how to cry when she is also doing the same. I do not feel soothed by her strokes on my back. I have not seen my parents in the same room for a long time. I don't understand too much to switch off my brain and just be with my dad as me.

*Question portion*

My father's vitals are being maintained steadily and forcefully in a relaxed state. But he almost died immediately on Friday afternoon, and would be passing on in the next few days.

What or how should I value in these last final days? What to do in these remaining days? I am so afraid of wasting my time sleeping or eating instead of staying with him. Personally, I am carrying guilt (new and existing) from the inaction and regrets that come from not progressing enough in my trauma to have expressed my love **freely** to my father before this time has come. While for him, I wonder what I can do.

Less immediate, but when his time comes to an end, what are other ways to think about it than ""moving on""? Welcome to any reflections, suggestions, stories, resources, support. Thank you.",0

"I [24M] have experienced a greatly declining quality of health, both physical and mental, for the last 5 years. I know that I'm not supposed to  ask for medical advice but just for the sake of giving ya'll some background I have ADHD, an auto immune disorder, and low testosterone. Although the auto immune thing is under control I've had no luck with the other two. So far none of the meds have worked for ADHD and while the chlomid did greatly boost my testosterone levels I noticed no benefit nor change from it for the last six months. For the last 3 years I have been unbelievably fatigued and it's only gotten worse. It's so bad that no matter how much I sleep I always wake up feeling completely spent. As it is I barely have the energy to do one biggish activity a day and I'm supposed to start welding school this tuesday. So the main thing is that if this is what my life is going to be like for the unforseeable future then I want nothing to do with it. 

As for mental and emotional support I have none. Every single time I've even hinted at not feeling well emotionally my sisters have gotten angry and chewed me out. I also don't have any friends, just acquaintances that don't talk to me. Honestly, at this point the only big thing keeping me alive is my mother. She's currently taking care of my paralyzed father who had a stroke that has also left him being somewhat brain damaged. My death would just be too cruel for her at this time. 

This now brings me to my real question for ya'll. Have any of you committed yourself to the ER for mental health? All of the stories that I've read online make it sound like a hellish mistake. My main hope for going there would be to receive a med that could just knock me out and get some restful sleep for once. Yet I fear that going there will only subject me to more torment and somehow make my life even more unbearable. If you have any personal experience with this then please tell me. I have this deep fear that there is no victory against depression, that no matter what I do it will one day take me. I'm sorry if this post has seemed jumbled and illogical, but such is writing with ADHD.",0
"This evening my sister, a local ER triage nurse, told me her last patient of the day died while having sex.  He was 74.  I was very confused.  ""He was having sex in the ER?"", I densely asked.  To make the story snappy:

Old man says to wife, I love you and I just want to touch you.  Old wife agrees and throws back a few drinks as hubby pops a Viagra.  During the deed, dude starts having chest pains so she gives him an aspirin and BOOM.  He had the big one.  He died.  The now widow, told my sister he had a good life, loved her to death and just wanted to touch her and make love to her.  She professed that part of life was ""over"" for her but  she knew how much it meant to him.  I said to my sister, ""Yo, I don't care how old I am sex will never be game over for me!""  You know what she said to me?  ""Well, you get to a certain age after you've had children where you're just not interested in sex anymore.  Too old.""  F that.

I(m22) am currently working in the ems field. I went to college for awhile then dropped out. I went back for a career in emergency medicine. During school I absolutely loved the thought of having this job. I enjoyed every aspect of it. I have currently been working in the field for about four months. Working between the ambulance and mediVan ( wheel chair van). So far I have broken down in tears way more than on one occasion by myself never in public or with a patient. The mere thought of work makes my stomach churn. I never have had chest pains in my life and I have a history of heart problems. I have started this job and I had a little bit of chest pain. I am completely over eating or under eating. This morning I was extremely dizzy ( I never get that).  I'm not stupid I know this job is stressing me out more than I have ever been through. Am I just still new or is there something more? I really love the field and sometimes I enjoy my job and sometimes I feel like I'm going to shatter. What are your thoughts ?,0
"So there are a million and one threads about whether women find it a turn-off or even lose respect to platonic male friends who are vulnerable, going through a hard time, or simply lack perfect emotional composure. 

I will be honest. I find intergender relationships of ANY sort stressful. I am a highly sensitive person, with an anxiety disorder, it gives me shit, it's the biggest turn off possible I know, sucks, and it genuinely hurts to have to be around women for too long. As in physical pain, cortisol rises, it's tiring, I have had chest pains or headaches, in the past I've lost sleep from getting too close. I have to hide my authentic self. (The exception is with mother figures, usually women old enough to be my grandma, or therapists/doctors.) This is any woman my age; my friends, my SOs, whatever. I just do not trust them in that way. My dad tried it and paid the price for it. All my friends who did, got screwed over. 

I don't know how to handle this bar to opt out of society and go live as a hermit, but that's a shitty non-existence and something has to pay the bills. 

So, given I have to interact with them, but because of the nature of the game cannot be GENUINE when interacting with, must always perform and keep the wall up...how do I forgive them for unintentionally inflicting pain all the time and myself for being so...you know? Over sensitive? Again, I am trying to accept, it's not a conscious choice to disrespect guys of my nature, they cannot help it. (Generalisations of course, not all are like that)",0

"Kind of personal and grim, I do apologise for that in advance.

My grandpa who is nearing 70 has had a bypass and the doctor told him that the most important thing to do for recovery is walking as his extremities can still clog up and constrict since he is very overweight. However, he's kind of resigned on improving his condition because it hurts.

He used to be a heavy smoker and has problems with fine hand manipulation as his ligaments are extremely damaged from years working in a mine. Nowadays he can't even mow the lawn because of his condition and it's getting worse by the day.

I bring this here because I learned a lot about what it is to be a man from him even though we were never particularly close and it physically pains me to see him like this. He's a very hard man with a passion for maintenance work, but virtually no social life and hobbies.

We are at wits end about how we could help him as our recent attempt to get through to him ended up in him telling his own daughter that 'he is just waiting to die'.

It is a lot but do any of you have any advice? I'd be really grateful for anything at this point. Thanks.

EDIT: Wow, this thread really took of when I was asleep! I didn't expect that. Thank you all for voicing your ideas, you're an awesome community of genuine people.

I will be seeing him this week to see if I can interest him in offering help with some work on the car. Also, I'll try to convince my grandma to cook more healthily. It's a start and I don't expect it to be easy but I will try my best. This discussion also made me realize that I actually don't know much about his life so I'll try to rectify that while there's still time.

Thanks a bunch, again. Best regards.",0

"I'm looking to get healthier, stronger, improve my cardiovascular health. Healthy BMI, blood pressure etc. just a regular guy.

I like doing weights but can't afford to eat five chicken breasts a day or spend hours in the gym. I think I'm OK here, usually short sessions 2-3x week.

I find cardio hard but am making small gains, again I don't want to run marathons or anything just be generally healthy. Trying to get a quick cardio blast in every day and walk when possible.

Any recommendations, advice, or subreddits for more casual exercise regimes / routines?

[EDIT: Just to say my diet is generally good BTW, I could probably cut some alcohol but that's probably after lockdown ends. I tracked calories and macros for 2-3 years but now I mostly play it by ear as I think I have a good handle on it 🤷‍♂️]",0
