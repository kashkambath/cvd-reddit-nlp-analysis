0,"My dad had a heart attack and spent over 7 minutes without oxygen. He was paddle shocked 5 times and now jokes ""when I die...again..."". He says there was absolutely nothing. No ""white light"", no ""seeing your whole life before your eyes"". Nothing. He said it wasn't even scary since there just wasn't anything. The most jarring thing for him was that he woke up from his medically induced coma earlier than they expected and they didn't have anyone available to pull out his breathing tube, so he was awake for a good 10 hours before they could remove it. He was looking at us very oddly, but couldn't verbalize what the deal was. Apparently all his colors were jumbled and my very white mom looked almost eggplant purple to him. His black nurse wasn't a normal person color at all. When he was finally able to talk he asked my mom why she was purple. Then he asked the nurse if she was black, but he fought with finding words that weren't offensive until he stopped caring about trying and just blurted out ""are you black?!""",1
1,"I had dangerous open heart surgery due to multiple congenital heart defects at 4 years old. 

I was on ECMO life support where the heart is not beating. I remember before and after the surgery but I have no memory of during the surgery, so no supernatural experience for me. 

It was very traumatic so I may have blocked some of these memories.",1
2,"In June of 2020, my Dad collapsed in our yard while helping us mow the lawn. He's an older guy, 3-time cancer survivor with dizziness issues but this was a worse fall than we'd ever seen him. He insisted to my Mom that he was fine, and that she didn't need to worry about him. We were both skeptical, but we took his word and kept a close eye on him for the rest of the day.

Fast forward to a cardiology appointment I took him to in October. He was joking with his nurse that he didn't know why he even had a pacemaker put in back in 2015 or so, since it's not like it did anything when she looked him dead in the eyes and said, ""I beg to differ.""

Turns out his collapse was a heart attack, and he flatlined. If it wasn't for the pacemaker in his chest shocking his heart back into rhythm, he would have died right then and there. The good news is they figured out where the blockage was in his heart that caused the problem, and put a stent in. So he's doing alright, all things considered.

He later admitted to my Mom and I that it felt like he was being buried. He kept trying to climb out of the pit he was in, towards a bright light, but he never could get anywhere. And then he woke up. He didn't want to tell us when it happened, because he knew we would bring him to the ER.",1
3,"after my twin aunts were born, my grandma became severely ill and was clinically dead for a while. she claims to have had an out of body experience and that she went to heaven. apparently, from above she saw herself on the table with doctors trying to save her, and then woke up somewhere she didn’t recognise, but felt overwhelming peace, like she had never felt before, just complete peace and bliss. she then saw a man, and getting closer she saw it was a man whose name i think was harvey, or something along those lines. she grew up in a children’s home as her parents were refugees, and the only joy she had was when this man visited her each month before she aged out and he passed away. in heaven, she approached him and he told her it wasn’t her time yet, she hadn’t done everything she needed to do on earth. so she went back and recovered completely. she’s now my best friend.

i’ve had a couple close calls from suicide attempts but it’s just been pain and darkness.",1
4,"Not me but my mother is the most severe case I can think of.

Around 25 she started regularly having episodes of severe heart arrhythmias. So bad she fainted and seriously thought she would die (and once almost did because it happened while she was driving). Every doctor she saw told her she was just having panic attacks or was hysterically imagining things and that is wasn\`t as bad as she made it out to be, because by the time she reached the doctor the attack was over and she didn't show any signs of a heart attack in the EKGs. It took more than a dozen cardiologists and over 20 years of visiting doctors for one to finally believe her. She has Wolff-Parkinson-White-Syndrom in combination with a  disorder causing the blood to clot faster and form miniscule clots that reach the heart and trigger an attack but disolve later and can't be detected. She takes blood thinners now and hasn\`t had an attack since.",1
5,"Went on a road trip with two of my gals, to the middle of nowhere.

I was in the back as we approached a dead roo right in front of us on the road. Friend in passenger seat says 'Stop! I wanna take a picture!' Friend driving does,  the pic was taken by her sticking her hnd out the window, and then friend driving (it was her car), just keeps driving straight over the roo. Doesn't bother going around.

We hear things pop and crunch, and for the rest of the trip a bad smell came from the bottom of the car. 

Those two are so feral. Love em to bits, and we still laugh at this story often.",1
6,"As a doctor, this thread is causing me chest pain. Some of these things you can actually get very sick from. Or get cancer from. Or die from. ",1
7,"Do you happen to have high cholesterol? I've noticed this tends to be more common in people who have it. Taking care of the cholesterol won't necessarily do much for the current cyst, but may prevent others. Of course, this is only because I've had relatives who had it diagnosed.",1
8,"Cholesterol can be crazy. Even when I was a meat eater I had great cholesterol (160s range), and I'm fat. Meanwhile, my thin husband's always had cholesterol in the 200+ range, whether he's eaten meat, not eaten it, etc. He eats OK and gets plenty of movement in.

People have a lot of control of their health, but I think it frightens people to acknowledge just how much they also DON'T control. Family history plays a big role and we like to shy away from that because we want someone or something to blame.

9,"It was scary.  I actually had a series of four to five in 24 hours.  I  had never had any previous cardiac issues.  I was only 43 at the time, and I quite suddenly became nauseous and sweaty while showering.  I tried to finish up my shower and couldn’t.  I collapsed into my bed soaking wet and starting experiencing pain under my left breast, wrapping around my side to the back, my left shoulder up the left side of my neck.  I was shaking and my heart rate was high (I was able to have my son grab a pulse oximeter).  My poor teenage boys had to call an ambulance, and they were literally going to send me home from the ER because all the tests were coming back fine.  The only thing that caught it was my troponin levels increased-that’s how they knew heart damage had occurred.  It was labeled NSTEMI.  We never did find the cause-it wasn’t due to a blockage, so the doctors attributed it to an arrhythmia.  They haven’t found the arrhythmia problem to this day, I’m not on any blood thinners, and the cardiac doctors have given me a clean bill of health.  I still get concerned whenever I start getting hot/sweaty/nauseous at all, since I would have never expected those to be associated with having a heart attack, especially in my forties.  I hope this answers your question.",1
10,"OMD totally scary 

I was on campus when it happened.  Buying breakfast before class, when suddenly I had a hard time breathing.  It was like the air was too warm to breathe.  I collected my breakfast, put it in my bag and quickly took my stuff to the first aid room.  I then collapsed on the floor, took my jacket, scarf, hoodie and hat off, and security called for first aid.  They called the ambulance who thought it was either asthma, acid reflux, anxiety, or an allergic reaction.  We decided to go to the hospital.  They took an EKG and said something isn't right.  Immediately to the trauma bay and this point onwards is a bit of a blur in my memory.  But they transferred me to another hospital.  They took me to the Cath Lab and put a stent in my artery via my wrist.  It was incredibly painful.  There was also something heavy on my chest. The pain from the heart attack combined with whatever heavy item was on my chest, made me feel really nauseous and unwell.  After surgery, I was in the hospital for 6 days.  I couldn't move my wrist for 24 hours, and an IV line was put in my other arm, so I couldn't move that either.  My parents had to help me with meals because of both arms being immovable.  I also hadn't eaten since the night before because my breakfast was still in my bag.  I was the youngest on the ward.  This was 2 months ago.  And I am still learning how to deal with it day by day.  I have 5 new meds to take.  I gotta check my weight everyday, and my blood pressure, and heart rate have to be monitored.  I got a Fitbit to monitor my heart rate since the clinics are closed.  I have since been diagnosed with a condition called SCAD which is the cause of my heart attack.",1
11,"I had my first one at 18 years old. My entire left side went numb, I became extremely dizzy, disoriented, cold sweats and nauseated. I went to the hospital and was told my troponin levels were elevated and I likely experienced a ""heart related event."" I was never told it was a 'heart attack' but it was more likely a 'transient ischemic attack.' In any case, both of those events are centered around the inability to get oxygen normally to a part of the body (brain/heart/lungs) due to a clot or other vascular issue. I was given no meds, not asked to stay for observation, nothing.

The wildest thing to me is that at that time, it was well-known that I was having issues with my energy/tiredness due to my heart condition. I had surgery as a baby and needed surgery less than a year after this even to close an atrial septal defect in the middle of the atria of my heart that had gotten to be 15 mm wide.

I do not think women are taken as seriously as men when it comes to heart attacks. Men have symptoms that are more ""textbook"" while women definitely do not. But when your heart is fucking up, boy can you tell. Whether you're a man or a woman. I have since learned to advocated for my own health - its easy to do when you have a chronic heart condition from birth.",1
12,"I think it is important for women to share symptoms because they are often atypical. I never experienced any pain but woke up feeling incredibly dizzy with an extremely cold feeling inside my chest. Lots of heart issues in my family so I called for an ambulance at 6:30 a.m. By 10:00 I was in open heart surgery for a quadruple bypass. Apparently I had a heart attack on the table but because they had already started I survived. Had I been at home at the time I probably would not have made it to the hospital. I now eat a plant based diet, exercise regularly and feel great two years post surgery.",1
13,"I don't know. I didn't realize that I had one until having tests done afterwards that showed there was damage from it. I did not have the traditional symptoms and did not recognize it as a heart attack while it was occurring. I've always had a couple of heart conditions, so I'm used to feeling the effects from those, but it must not have presented that way at the time.",1
14,"I was 32, a Kindergarten teacher. It was 1995. I’d been taking a triptan drug for migraine headaches for a couple of years. This one particular occasion, a few hours after I took the tablet, I began to feel terrible pressure in my chest and up into the left side of my jaw. I honestly thought it was indigestion at first and chewed some antacid tablets. The pressure and feeling of panic grew. I called my parents. They got me and drove me to the local ER. 

It was set up with a “triage” nurse at a desk where you came in. The nurse wrote down your symptoms and sent your name to the back. You were told to go to the waiting area and wait until a nurse came out and called your name. 

So, I went to the desk and said I was having chest pains and was starting to feel nauseated. The nurse looked at me and said, “Well, you’re not having a heart attack. Go sit over there and wait for someone to call you.” We sat down. I remember that I started sweating and I was moaning as the pain in my chest intensified. It was very crowded, children crying, noise, smells...we’d been waiting over an hour when I found myself suddenly on my hands and knees puking on some random guy’s foot. 

Just at that moment one of the ER nurses came out from the treatment area to call the next patient and saw me. Turns out she was the mother of one of my students. She rushed me to the back, heard the words “chest pain” and had the doctor, an IV, nitro, EKG all inside 15 minutes. 

I was in the ICU for 2 days, had a cardiac cath, and stress test. It was determined that I had no blockage or other cardiac disease. However, the triptan migraine drug had caused me to have spasms in my coronary artery. They were severe enough to cause a myocardial infarction that left me with moderate heart damage.",1
15,"Not me, but my mother. A few weeks ago, my mother decided to go out and hang out with her friend. That night, I was surprised that I didn't get a goodnight text or any of the sort as she would always either call me or text me. I thought nothing of it as she probably fell asleep. The next morning, I noticed how my mother wasn't home. Once again, I thought nothing of it and that she probably wanted to spend more time with her friend. 

The next day, I was starting to get worried until she called me. She said that she was in the hospital, and that she ended up getting a heart attack. I gave my step father the phone as she wanted to talk to him, and he didn't even believe her. He truly didn't believe that my mother was in the hospital and just passed it off as ""trying to start an argument."" It took nearly an hour for him to realize that my mother was serious as he could hear one of the machines through the phone. I had to stay away from my step father that weekend as I would have cursed him out for that. 

Two days later, we picked my mother up from the hospital, and we learned that she was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. During the time at home, she always said how her shoulder hurts, and I had to massage it time to time. She also had many dark bruises on her arms. A few weeks later she is doing fine. Her shoulder still hurts but it's getting better. I'm just happy that she's here with me.

Edit: Fixed some typos",1
16,"My mum had a heart attack at 51.  She had struggled with heart burn for years anyway, so when she had those feelings she wasn’t too concerned.  She woke up in the night and was vomiting and my dad went to help her.  He said that she went all floppy and clammy and very pale.  My dad was in the army for 24 years and he’s had some medical training so he guessed she was having a heart attack and called 999 immediately.  My mum didn’t even want him to call the ambulance because she didn’t think it could be that serious. 

When they arrived they did tests and said that she had had a heart attack.  She was denying it even to the paramedics! I don’t know the exact details of it but she had a blockage and they removed it by going through her vein and into her artery (again, I don’t know the exact details).  She had smoked since she was 15 so she quit straight away and cleaned up her diet, as well as going on several medications.  4 years later and she’s fine! She was also diagnosed as pre-diabetic but she’s managed to control that.

I wasn’t actually there for any of this because this took place during my first year at uni.  But yeah, even my mum, in the midst of a heart attack, was denying that she was having a heart attack.  Medical advice is so clearly aimed at men, and it could have cost my mum her life if my dad hadn’t been there and acted on his instinct and knowledge.",1
17,"As someone with PTSD related to ""feeling heart attacks"", I don't think I'll ever know the difference between them and my panic attacks.",1
18,"My mother died from a “widow maker” heart attack. The left anterior descending artery was 90% occluded when they did the autopsy. She had been complaining of issues off and on but kept writing them off as something else. The morning she died and the night before she had complained of nausea. The ER doctor told us she most likely was having a heart attack for hours and didn’t realize it. I was not with her when she died. 

Now whenever I feel suddenly nauseous I panic.",1
19,"suffered a heart attack one week after i gave birth. had a sudden coronary artery dissection (SCAD) due to pregnancy. i had no clue pregnancy increases the risk of a heart attack! i was in ICU for a week, had a cardiac catheterization, and they found the torn artery. i was 28 with normal weight, no drinking and smoking, and no medical history. was put on coumadin (blood thinner) for a month. the worst part was pumping my breast milk and throwing them out. after a month of normal healing, they decided that i was pretty much back to normal (95%). now 13 years later, life is fairly uneventful. i just couldn’t do major exercises (heart rate no higher than 130). i was supposed to see a cardiologist every year but life happened. until three years ago, i was diagnosed with breast cancer. now i see a cardiologist every year. once i’m off tamoxifen (for the cancer), i’ll resume daily baby aspirin",1
20,"Mom had sort of the same thing. We took her to the ER and they said she didn’t have any signs, but because it’s a rural hospital they sent her to the city. They said her triponin (sp?) started out really low, but kept increasing.

The first cardiologist said they “might” have to put 1 maybe 2 stents in, but once they started doing the procedure realized she needed quadruple bypass surgery.",1
21,"Dang, the beginning of this sounded like my hot flashes with perimenopause... until you mentioned the pain. 

I have a 30% blockage in the left main artery (widowmaker). Before they found out how mild it actually was, I was 2 DAYS from a double bypass surgery.  I was freaking terrified at 48 years old. Dx with PTSD not long after that hospital stay.  I take my cholesterol medication & calcium blockers religiously now. I try to eat better & take my supplements. Exercise with my other health issues is difficult, but I love to walk.",1
22,"How high was your heart rate? I'm always worried I'll ignore signs of a heart attack because I have hEDS and POTS, which causes regular pain in my chest, ribs, shoulders, arms, neck and back along with a very high heart rate most of the time.",1
23,"This is so frustrating. It’s been very well known in science now that heart attacks in women are fairly different than in men. And a lot of doctors still are not paying enough attention on this matter.

I’m sorry to hear you didn’t get that treatment you deserve! I hope you are in better health now! Please in doubt go to a doctor! You know what you feel!!",1
24,"My story is very similar but I had a stroke at 27.   Luckily my cardiologist was European and took it more seriously than the American doctors (I’m in the US).  We will just say the heart defect was more widely recognized and understood in Europe and covered by insurance where in the US it’s a battle to get it done.   After lots of heart issues they closed the hole in my heart as well.  My cardiologist told the people who deal with insurance that I was likely to have additional more severe strokes, so it was a “cheaper” preventative measure.  My energy level, stress, migraines, everything improved so drastically.  Seriously a whole new life.",1
25,"It's sort of infuriating that the signs of both a heart attack and an anxiety attack are largely the same for women, and we don't always know if it's the former until it's dangerously past when we should be getting help. I'm so happy you survived!",1
26,"I read heart attacks in women tend to have different symptoms than men's, so the publicized symptoms don't often match Women's heart attacks. What was your experience?",1
27,"The same thing happened to me-- they found heart damage on an EKG while doing a routine pre-surgery check. I was only 29 so it was pretty odd...

Stress tests showed nothing of note. Heart is perfectly functional otherwise so we went ahead with surgery. I can't recall any time where I experienced any cardiac symptoms (including the ""atypical"" ones women get) so I really do wonder. The cardiologist suggested it might be also be congenital damage or a weird placement thing. I don't have any trouble with exercise or any day to day things so the doctors told me not to worry.",1
28,Wow! It's really great your doctor figured it out. I have POTS and EDS too and this is my worst fear--how will I tell my normal symptoms from a heart attack?,1
29,"Omg. ""Well, you're not having a heart attack"" YIKES. I hope that nurse rethought **that** one after what happened.",1
30,Which triptan??? I know this was 1995 but I’m so concerned. I have migraines and my mother died of a heart attack in 2014 at 67.,1
31,"Hi there! At 16, unless you have a pretty serious congenital heart issue, it’s almost unheard of to have a heart attack. It takes time for arteriosclerosis to build up in your blood vessels and cause a blockage, and it’s very unlikely to happen by the time you’re 16. It’s possible that you have another cardiac issue, such as an arrhythmia, but what is much more likely is anxiety attacks. They’re extremely common and can mimic a lot of the symptoms of a heart attack (ie. difficulty breathing, chest pain, shaking, sweating, nausea, headache, etc.). I suspect that’s probably why your doctor said ‘it’s nothing’ in response to your symptoms. They can feel like you’re dying but have no lasting effects, so it’s hard for medical professionals to detect them once they’re over.",1
32,"Thank you so much, a definite bump on my life journey I was not expecting at my age for sure, but appreciating listening to baby birds outside my window at 7am now 💜. Always a positive in the negatives if you look. I think its the whole numb left arm etc, seemingly a lot of women dont get that, and it's the symptom most people ""look"" for in association with a heart attack. So we do tend to ""brush off"" major signs and symptoms until it's at crisis point unfortunately.",1
33,"I'm not a doctor, in any shape or form but I'd think, purely from my experience, you would know if you had a heart attack. I get anxiety pretty bad and have done for years but there was literally a period of probably not even 2 hours between what I thought could've been really bad anxiety and realising that something was seriously wrong, and I now have a metal stent in my heart keeping one of my very much needed valves open, which I'm told stopped the pain and feelings I had. Not a ""feeling"" I ever want to experience again, but very quickly becomes obvious it's not just anxiety/attack and didnt go away at all for me, so I wouldn't worry too much but most definitely speak to your doctor and explain your worries, and a simple test should hopefully be able to put your mind at ease. I'm hoping I'm helping more than hindering here",1
34,"That's correct, and one reason why women are more likely to not survive. Research on heart attacks was conducted on men, and it's only recently that these differences are being discussed. 

This situation extends to many, many other areas of life, from medication dosage recommendations, to seatbelt placement.",1
35,"It really varies person to person. I've seen both classic (Crushing chest pain with and without radiation to other parts of the body) and non classic (Dizzy, Nausea/ Vomiting, Flu like symptoms) from both genders. I think because a heart attack can have such vague symptoms is why almost all ER patients now get an EKG and at least 1 troponin level done. 

Not so fun fact: uncontrolled diabetes can damage nerves enough that your body doesn't receive the ""Chest pain announcement"" and is one of the many reasons practitioners push so hard to keep diabetes under control.",1
36,To be fair she was also 14. It’s not common at all for teens to get heart attacks which is likely why they said it was probably nothing,1
37,"This reminds me of the Grey's Anatomy episode when Dr. Bailey had a heart attack. 

As women we have to know that symptoms for a heart attack are different than for men.

38,"This comment has scared me. A few months ago before christmas I woke up in the middle of the night suddenly feeling very sick, I ran to the bathroom, my temp suddenly spiked, I went dizzy and passed out on the bathroom floor. When I woke up, I felt tired but better, not sick anymore just had a bit of a headache that didn't pass for a couple of days, I never went to the doctors because i put it down to being a migraine as I do get them but never like that. There is a history of heart trouble in my family, my dad passed from it before his 40th birthday and I am 36 now. Obviously doctors have other things on their plate to deal with now so I won't be going until it happens again but at least I know the signs now.",1
39,"I don’t know- I took a shower before and the whole time I was thinking is this a heart attack or am I just worrying? Lmao.

SUCKS",1
40,"The first doctor was female, and wasn't really interested in what I had to say. I'm in the UK so I use the NHS, and from personal experience I'd say the system as a whole isn't really interested. I do have a male doctor now who's a lot more friendly than the previous one, so funnily enough I actually think he'd pay more attention to me.

I realise where you're coming from and I do appreciate the concern, but at the same time I'm not dead yet and I suspect that if they were actual heart attacks I'd be dead by now. They're certainly worrying, but a) I can't really get to the doctors because of the pandemic and b) I don't want to find out I have a heart condition in case it precludes me from entering my career of choice.",1
41,"Hey, I'm in the UK, I'm about ten years older than you but I have some experience with similar issues.

If you're worried that you're in an emergency situation with your symptoms, please do call an ambulance or get someone to take you to A&E. They will look after you. About three years ago I started getting horrible chest pains, sweating, dizziness. I was young and healthy and there were no risk factors. But I went to A&E because it was bloody terrifying. They couldn't find anything wrong, but said its good that I came because it's better safe than sorry with chest pain. This happened twice more, and I got diagnosed with costochondritis - but the important thing is, each time I was reassured that I did the right thing by going to the hospital. Yes, they don't like people wasting time, but by that they mean ""don't come in for a papercut"" - things you are genuinely worried about are 100% OK to go in with.",1
42,"I know many have commented about anxiety but I had a very similar thing happen when I was 16 and there were multiple times I was 100% convinced I was having a heart attack. Idk how many times my mom rushed me to the ER and the countless appointments we went to for everything to come back normal. Turns out it was anxiety, and I had no idea because I didn’t “feel” anxious at the time. 
Not saying what you’ve got going on IS anxiety, but just keep an open mind because even if you’re not feeling anxious or don’t think anything anxiety-inducing has happened, anxiety attacks can still get ya! 

Also, I was diagnosed with some sort of somatic personality disorder (I forget the name, just remember it had somatic in it, bc that was literally 15 years ago and after therapy I managed to “fix” it for the most part, although on rare occasions I’ll catch myself doing it) - when I get super emotional (whether it’s anger/sadness/fear) instead of “feeling” that emotion like most people do, I manifest it into physical symptoms. A lot of times I wouldn’t realize I was angry/upset/whatever, I’d just get the physical symptom and be like wtf is wrong with my body. 

It’s not unheard of to be young and have a heart condition, my brother had lots of chest pain/heart attack feelings and found out that while he does, in fact, have anxiety, he also has a valve issue that causes some of the chest pain. Just keep an open mind though, like I said, anxiety/other issues can still be a problem even if you don’t feel anxious/whatever emotion when it’s happening!",1
43,"Thanks, I notice I've been down voted a few times for saying I don't think it's anxiety but I really do appreciate all the input I'm getting. It's possible it's anxiety, as I've said I really don't know a lot about it so I'll have to do some research.

Yeah, I have a friend who had to have open heart surgery when he was about 12/13 for a valve issue that meant he fainted whenever he got too excited. I don't think it's necessarily something like that, but where I don't know a lot about anxiety I know even less about heart conditions. Considering I've been having this on and off for 2 years now, I don't know why I've never really looked into potential causes. At the end of the day, I think it's down to my somewhat cavalier approach to my health. If I'm not dying, it's not a problem, and if I am dying well it'll happen sooner or later so it's still not a massive problem in my eyes. Maybe a cynical approach, potentially even a worrying one if I'm honest, but I've never been too bothered about the idea of my own death.",1
44,"I had a heart attack at 28 caused by coronary artery spasm (prinzmetal’s angina). 
I had been feeling pretty bad on and off for 2 days, short of breath, felt exhausted, ‘tired’ feeling in my upper chest and left arm/shoulder. Like the muscle fatigue you feel if you’ve been using your arms above your head for too long. And lots palpitations. I was fine one minute and felt like I had been running a marathon the next, over and over.
Went to the GP twice those 2 days, but I was diagnosed with an anxiety attack and told I was hyperventilating. The evening of the second day it got worse, I was so very tired and my arm felt heavy, and I started getting nauseous. I was watching a movie with my BF, and at one point I told him I was feeling really bad and was going to bed. I got up from the couch, walked 3 steps and collapsed. He dialed the emergency services (I did wake up pretty soon and was able to walk back to the couch before they arrived), and when they arrived and hooked me up to a monitor I was told I was having a heart attack. 

I had no significant pain, more like a dull ache and tiredness, like muscle fatigue, left arm/shoulder and upper chest. The exhaustion was the worst, and I couldn’t walk two steps without getting winded and my heart beating out of my chest. And I knew something was VERY wrong.

I recovered fast and with no lasting damage by the way, and with medication it has not happened again. I was in good physical condition, and still am, and because I seemed fit, healthy and young the GP didn’t think it was something serious.",1
45,"Not me, but my mom had one at 45. We've talked a lot about it and what if felt like, for her. 

The first time she felt like something was wrong, we were having a huge fight. I said something shitty, and instead of reprimanding or even yelling back she just sat on the couch. She said she felt out of breath, and like her arms had just turned to lead. I wanted to call 911 but she was ADAMANT that she was fine. 

Fast forward a few weeks, she's been exhausted. She's missed so much work because she's ready to nap by 2pm, and needs to go home. She hasn't felt heavy and leaden since that night, but her chest and back felt really tight. After 3 weeks of feeling like this, she finally went to a hospital. Turns out she had a ""serious cardiac event"" and needed a stent put in. She was hospitalized for about a week. 

She said it never felt painful or sharp, and it didn't feel sudden like in movies.

46,"I haven't had a heart attack, but since these stories are being shared I wanted to note the difference between cardiac arrest and a heart attack. My father had a heart attack without going into arrest and somehow this wasn't communicated to my brother or me so we didn't fully grasp what was happening, and I've since heard many people dismiss their symptoms because they don't match a movie scenario.

Below is an abbreviated version from the [American Heart Association](http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks/heart-attack-or-sudden-cardiac-arrest-how-are-they-different), but they have the full signs and symptoms of a heart attack or stroke on their website. As well as info on Hands-Only CPR. Hopefully okay to share here.

""People often use these terms interchangeably, but they are not synonyms. A heart attack is when blood flow to the heart is blocked, and sudden cardiac arrest is when the heart malfunctions and suddenly stops beating unexpectedly. A heart attack is a “circulation” problem and sudden cardiac arrest is an “electrical” problem.
 
Symptoms of a heart attack may be immediate and intense. More often, though, symptoms start slowly and persist for hours, days or weeks before a heart attack. Unlike with sudden cardiac arrest, the heart usually does not stop beating during a heart attack. The heart attack symptoms in women can be different than men.

Sudden cardiac arrest occurs suddenly and often without warning. It is triggered by an electrical malfunction in the heart that causes an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). With its pumping action disrupted, the heart cannot pump blood to the brain, lungs and other organs. Seconds later, a person loses consciousness and has no pulse. Death occurs within minutes if the victim does not receive treatment.""

47,"This question is SO IMPORTANT!!!! I haven’t, but in my life support class we learned it is a fact that heart attacks feel different for women than men. It’s not as widely known as it should be, but women need to know that a heart attack won’t feel/look like the classic signs. ",1
48,"I have not had a heart attack but I am a nurse who works in a hospital unit that deals with them on a regular basis :)

Just for clarification, as another Redditor pointed out, a ""heart attack"" is a term commonly applied to two different scenarios: a blockage in a coronary artery that causes heart muscle damage (myocardial infarction) OR when the heart isn't pumping blood properly and essentially stops (cardiac arrest), causing a person to essentially die unless someone helps (I.e. CPR +/- defibrillation). However, the two aren't necessarily exclusive - a myocardial infarction *can* cause a cardiac arrest if left untreated (though cardiac arrests aren't always caused by myocardial infarctions, and there are different types of cardiac arrests.....yeah, it's complicated lol).

So for this post, I'm going to assume ""heart attack"" to mean myocardial infarction, which is more common but harder to diagnose (because let's be real, if you go into cardiac arrest, you die, and that's not hard to miss).

The classic symptoms of a myocardial infarction are:

* Chest pain or pressure (often described as squeezing, like a band over the chest, or ""like an elephant sitting on the chest"")
* Pain radiating to the left arm and/or jaw
* Shortness of breath
* Nausea +/- vomiting
* Sweating
* Just generally feeling that something is very wrong

However, I've also seen lots of people say they had vague symptoms.

Most common of the subtle symptoms is the feeling of indigestion or heartburn. I can't count the amount of times I've heard the story of ""ate a big meal, went to bed, woke up with indigestion, took an antacid, and still felt like shit, continued to take antacids, and when I felt really unwell, went to the hospital."" The general rule of thumb I like to stick to is, if you're having heartburn and it won't go away with heartburn treatment, see a doctor. Even if it's ""just"" heartburn, you'll want to get it treated, anyway, because if left uncontrolled, it can damage your esophagus.

Other vague symptoms would be things like back pain, arm pain, nausea, intense fatigue, and dizziness. In fact, a couple of times, I've had patients who had no symptoms at all until we ran some tests on them; this is most common in people with diabetes.

While women are more likely to have the non-traditional signs and symptoms, men can have them, too, just like women can also have the classic signs. In fact, my first patient with a silent heart attack (no signs or symptoms) was a man!

So yeah, it's not very cut and dry but if you are ever concerned, please just call 911 (or whatever number you call for an ambulance) and get yourself to a hospital. Even if it turns out to be nothing, don't feel embarrassed or feel like you've wasted our time. We always take potential cardiac symptoms seriously because it's hard for us to tell, too, based on signs and symptoms alone, and the tests are fairly easy and quick. And  like a lot of other major ailments, it's best to get treated early rather than let it go on and on, potentially causing major damage.

Lastly, because I always get messaged, *please* no one ask me medical questions about you or a specific person. I cannot make assessments and give advice over the internet. If you have concerns about yourself or a loved one, please see a doctor in person.",1
49,"My mom had one last year and said it wasn't what men are known to experience at all. She had gone to bed and felt uneasy, said her heart started to ""smash and bang"" and generally felt anxious and unwell. She said she just knew something was wrong and suspected a heart attack, as they run in the family (she was the fourth of her siblings to have one within a three-year span) and my grandmother had died of one when I was a baby. My dad drove her to the hospital and it was confirmed she had a ""mild, non-stemi"" heart attack. Heart disease seems to be hitting the family younger and younger so my brother and I are probably at risk of developing it too. 

&#x200B;

For the record, my mom has never smoked, quit drinking and had good cholesterol. ",1
50,"“HNGGHHHH” - me, during my heart attack",1
51,"Which part exactly is false? My point was that [women are more likely to experience non-traditional/not-so-obvious signs and symptoms](http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/warning-signs-of-a-heart-attack/heart-attack-symptoms-in-women), but men can, too. The signs and symptoms are really variable across the board.

Quoted directly from the linked page from the American Heart Association:

>“Although men and women can experience chest pressure that feels like an elephant sitting across the chest, women can experience a heart attack without chest pressure, ” said Nieca Goldberg, M.D., medical director for the Joan H. Tisch Center for Women's Health at NYU’s Langone Medical Center and an American Heart Association volunteer. “Instead they may experience shortness of breath, pressure or pain in the lower chest or upper abdomen, dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting, upper back pressure or extreme fatigue.”

Or from the [Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.ca/heart/conditions/heart-attack):

>Women generally recognize the “Hollywood heart attack” with chest-clutching, crushing pain. If their pain is less severe, or if they have non-pain signs such as nausea, sudden fatigue or shortness of breath (signs more often reported by women), they are more likely to delay getting to emergency care, and once there, they are less likely to get fast, aggressive treatment.",1
52,"Not me, but I'm a nurse who works frequently with heart attack patients (for simplicity, I'm calling them heart attacks, when I mean ""myocardial infarctions"" - a blockage in one or more coronary arteries, causing heart muscle damage due to a lack of oxygen supplied by blood). The symptoms range from the very typical to really odd ones. I'd say the most common symptoms are pretty typical - a lot of chest pain (usually described as a ""heaviness"" like an elephant on the chest or a ""crushing"" or ""squeezing"", but people can have all sorts of different pains), often accompanied with symptoms like shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, and/or just generally feeling unwell and that something ""just isn't right"". Sometimes, the pain radiates to the jaw, the left arm, and/or the back, but I actually find it's less common than simply chest pain.

The most common vague symptom is definitely heartburn. Heartburn can mimic heart attacks and vice versa. I've seen people who thought they were having heartburn for days on end, when actually, they were having a heart attack (because it's not like on TV, where people suddenly clutch at their chests and keel over; such cases are usually the people who go into arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, which *can* be caused by heart attacks but not always). Usually, the key difference is the presence of other symptoms described above, but as I said, they're not always present. This is one of the reasons why it's important to get heartburn checked out if it doesn't respond to over-the-counter medications (the other side to it is that heartburn can actually do damage to your esophagus over time, so it's best to nip that in the bud in its early stages).

Lastly, I hope I don't scare anyone here, but there is also such a thing as ""silent heart attacks"", where a person is having a heart attack but there aren't any symptoms. It's more common in those with diabetes and the elderly. I once had a patient who was in hospital for a gangrenous toe (don't get diabetes, folks), and one morning, he was awake early and reading the newspaper, so I did a set of vital signs on him. To my surprise, his pulse was in the 140's (for reference, normal rate is 60-100, though we start to get worried around the 110-120 range). Called the doctor, who ordered some tests. The patient was totally calm, no pain or breathing difficulties (except for his sore toe). Turns out he was having a heart attack! He was treated for it and did fine, but sometimes I wonder what would have happened if he were sitting at home rather than in the hospital.

(**EDIT:** I am getting a few questions about the heart rate thing. I should add that heart rate alone is *not* an indicator of anything. It has to be taken in context. *Lots* of things can cause a high heart rate, from benign causes like anxiety or too much caffeine to more concerning things like a serious heart condition. One must take into consideration things like other vital signs, signs and symptoms, the patient's history, etc., to get even a decent clinical picture of what's going on. If a high heart rate can be explained, then it's not as big of a deal, either. For example, if a person is in respiratory distress, then they will have a heart rate because, well, they're struggling to breathe. As soon as you fix the respiratory issues, the heart rate should come down nicely. Also, the 110-120 range is still referring to a *resting* heart rate, and don't forget that I work in a hospital, often with patients who have co-morbidities that affect the heart's health and/or are elderly, who typically have lots of co-morbidities anyway. A young, healthy person may be able to tolerate a resting heart rate in the 110-120 range if, say, they get sick. An elderly person who has diabetes and heart disease? Yeah, not so much. A person who has just had a heart attack? Same. Their hearts just aren't able to work as hard as a young, healthy person's for prolonged periods of time. If you're young, healthy, and not sick or anxious or anything like that and your *resting* heart rate is elevated, then I wouldn't say it's a cause to panic, but you may want to get checked out by your family doctor - could be anything from anxiety to a malfunctioning thyroid to an actual problem with your heart. Again, go with your gut. If something feels *wrong* to you and you're that concerned about it, then talk to a doctor. I can't diagnose anything over the Internet...plus, I'm a nurse so I don't diagnose things in general!)

On the flip side, you can also have all the symptoms of a heart attack and even had things like electrocardiogram changes that suggest a heart attack, but in actuality, your coronary arteries don't have any blockages! (i.e. not a heart attack) An example would be [Takotsubo cardiomyopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takotsubo_cardiomyopathy) (a.k.a. Broken Heart Syndrome). I've looked after two patients with this diagnosis and it's really bizarre. Basically, the heart muscle will be injured, often due to stress (hence the name Broken Heart Syndrome - it's been known to happen after a person has lost a loved one), so we'll often see changes in the ECG, troponin level rise in the blood (often used to determine severity of a heart attack), and even indicators of heart failure. However, when an angiogram is done, there aren't any coronary artery blockages. The good news is that people generally do well after this, so long as they take care of themselves.

So basically, the heart is a very complicated organ and there is no real way to tell if there's something seriously wrong with it or not based on symptoms alone. As well, pain in the chest can be caused by so many different things, from anxiety to costocondritis to pulmonary emboli to heart attacks. Basically, if you have a concern about it, go see a doctor. Go with your gut and don't ignore symptoms that won't go away.

**LAST EDIT:** I'm getting lots of people asking me about their specific situations. As per Reddit policy (and because it's uncomfortable for me), I won't be giving medical advice to *anyone*. I can't evaluate anyone over the Internet. I'd merely be taking wild guesses, which isn't safe. If you have an actual concern about your health, please see a professional in real life, who can discuss things with you and do an examination.",1
53,"EMT here. I once treated a woman who was exhibiting all the classic signs of an anxiety attack, but we decided to do an EKG just in case because she was also feeling gassy. I'm glad we didn't just write her off as she requested because she was in a full-blown STEMI! Another time a family friend called me because she was just feeling a sense of doom and heaviness, like an elephant was sitting on her. I told her to call an ambulance just in case, and sure enough, it was a heart attack. 

Big ones to watch out for are difficulty breathing, feeling ""tight"" in the chest, weakness in both arms, or just feeling like something is really, really off. I always say air on the side of caution.",1
54,"This is an awesome question! Women have definitely been seen to have much different symptoms from men and it's so important to know about how cardiac episodes can present themselves for women vs. men.  Heart disease might not be the most popular or talked about cause, but heart disease and strokes are the cause of death of one out of every three women. 

I've been involved with the American Heart Association for years and they have a TON of resources but below are some pointers. Overall, all the survivors I've heard speak over the years typically say they experienced headaches and ""heaviness,"" but not the traditional arm tingling and crushing chest pain. It was much more subtle. 

Lastly, one of the big things we always try to hit home is it is so often that women are the last to raise their hand and recognize something is really wrong with them. We put others in front of us and think that it will just pass. One women told me she went the whole day, getting her sons to school, cooking dinner for her family, while she was suffering from a severe cardiac episode. She just didn't think it was serious enough to bother anyone with until she collapsed. 

**Signs of a Heart Attack**

- Uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain in the center of your chest. It lasts more than a few minutes, or goes away and comes back.

- Pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach.

- Shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort.

- Other signs such as breaking out in cold sweat, nausea or lightheadedness.

- Women are somewhat more likely than men to experience some of the other common symptoms, particular shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting and back or jaw pain.

**Signs of Stroke and TIAs (transient ischemic attack)**

- Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body.

- Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding.

- Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes.

- Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination.- Sudden severe headache with no known cause.",1

She had also lost ~60 lbs over the previous 18 months in preparation for this trip, which involved a whole lot of walking.

63,"Sorry this is long.

That last bit--Broken Heart Syndrome--I had something similar but no broken heart.  10 years ago, I was in law school, my dad died, and I was becoming hypothyroid (undiagnosed another years).  So *everything* was stressing, and my bp was good if it was under 145/100.  This was for over a year.

Having chest pains, I was sent to a cardiologist.  He asked me to describe my pain; I described six distinct types of pains: weight on chest, like a tight band; pain under the sternum; pain up to my jaw; sharp pains (like nails being pounded in) just left of center on my chest; dull aches that had me grabbing at my chest; and the worst one--lasting pain like someone shoved a pipe through my chest and it was coming out my back.  Oh, and though it's just an indicator of inflammation *somewhere*, a CRP over 20.  I'd had years of heartburn; an endoscopy showed NO esophageal issues.

The cardiologist's mouth literally dropped open on that last bit, husband said it was because that was ""classic heart attack"" and I said I'd felt it 8 or 9 times.  EKG was clear--they've always been just fine since, too.  First stress test was ""inconclusive.""  Two years later, the second one was, too.  I also had a massive x-ray, had to go to San Francisco for that--no *major* problem found, calcification somewhere between 0 and 50%, so not really helpful.  Oh, and an ultrasound, and some other test I can't remember.  All that was found found was that my heart was a bit larger than expected, but not unduly so, and no thickening of the walls.  I was told that I could ""buy green bananas""--I'd be alive to eat them when ripe, if you didn't figure that out.

Finished law school, got thyroid dosage right (that took a couple of years), and with that find, I passed the Bar the second time.  Stress down, as I was not working.  When I had pain suddenly, I insisted on an angiogram, based on that pain, my history, and family history (father had blockage but his body had made its own diversions around it).  

I had NO significant blockage of ANY kind.  At age 50, my arteries weren't perfect, but we're about as good as a 25yo.  NO damage to my heart muscle.  CRP still won't come down.

71,"No not necessarily. A high heart rate could be a result of many things. If it's not accompanied by chest pain or any other symptom of a heart attack, I'd think of other possibilities first. Also (almost - 2 months away) a nurse. 
If you have a high heart rate, start to get dizzy, short of breath, feel it pounding in your chest or fluttering, have chest, jaw, back or arm pain - that's when you should go to the ER. 

I personally have inappropriate sinus tachycardia, which basically means my heart rate is around 120 when I'm at rest. It's totally benign for me. ",1
72,"I should really put a note on that...

110-120 is in context, and I meant that as a *resting* heart rate. Heart rate alone *does not mean anything* and other things - like other vital signs, signs and symptoms, history, etc. - must be taken into consideration to interpret what a heart rate means in a clinical sense.

Your resting heart rate is about 80, which falls within normal range. Remember, I work in a hospital with ill patients, usually an older population (i.e. age 60+), and most patients I see aren't typically the healthiest of people (i.e. typically have at least one co-morbidity, such as smoking, diabetes, COPD, cardiac disease of some sort, etc.). Where I work specifically - cardiology - if the heart has already sustained damage because of, say, a heart attack, then we do try to keep the resting heart rate below 90. Anything higher means the heart must work harder, which is like making an injured person run a race.

If you're young, otherwise healthy, and have no symptoms, it's likely not too worrying. I've had young patients come in for things like infections or uncontrolled blood sugars (type 1 diabetics), and the doctors are fine with them having heart rates in the 120's because they're young and can compensate for that fast a rate (and there's an obvious explanation for it). A person in their 80's who has multiple co-morbidities? Yeah, their bodies just aren't as capable of compensating for as long.

Obviously, I can't diagnose anything over the Internet, but if your heart is beating fast with just ""any movement"" and you have no symptoms but is normal at rest, I'd hazard a guess that you may want to work on your cardio exercises if you aren't already? If you're physically fit, though, then I honestly have no idea and someone would have to actually evaluate you in person.",1

For various reasons, women are likelier than men to use aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), and so are likelier to experience their harmful side-effects.


>With some exceptions, autoimmune diseases tend to affect one sex more than the other; specifically, far more women than men. For some time, physicians and researchers have been asking why this is so. The most popular theory to date has been that female hormones set the stage for diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis. 


>Graves Disease

>Recent studies put the incidence of Graves' disease at one to two cases per 1,000 population per year in England. It occurs much more frequently in women than in men. The disease frequently presents itself during early adolescence or begins gradually in adult women, often after childbirth, and is progressive until treatment. It has a powerful hereditary component.[3] Graves' disease tends to be more severe in men, even though it is rarer. It appears less likely to go into permanent remission and the eye disease tends to be more severe, but men are less likely to have large goitres.[65] In a statistical study of symptoms and signs of 184 thyrotoxic patients (52 men, 132 women), the male patients were somewhat older than the females, and cases were more severe among men than among women. Cardiac symptoms were more common in women, even though the men were older and more often had a severe form of the disease; palpitations and dyspnea were more common and severe in women.[3]

A few years back my mom was under quite a bit of stress. She started having intermittent chest pains and, very concerned, she went to the doctor ... turned out to be heartburn.",1
79,"Yes, I am aware. I am an EMT and every time we have any cardiac related con-ed we talk about this. 

I know there are disorders women are more or less likely than men to have. As far as the same disease manifesting differently though? All that comes to my sleep deprived mind is autism and ADD/ADHD, all of which tend to manifest differently in males and females. But they aren't really medical emergencies. ",1

81,"It's 100% related to anxiety.  Not that I'm having panic attacks that *feel* like heart attacks, just that every time I feel something that is listed as a heart attack symptom I'm like, ""YUP IT MUST BE A HEART ATTACK""",1
82,"I've seen a lot of women having heart attacks and they have all displayed the typical ""classic"" heart attack signs and symptoms.  They describe crushing, squeezing, or heavy pain in the center of their chest, often shortness of breath, pain radiation to the jaw or L arm, and they have all had an intense sense of fear/impending doom.  

There is always the possibility of having an atypical presentation though, such as nausea which won't go away, ""not feeling right"", and abnormal weakness/fatigue.  These types of symptoms are more common in the elderly/diabetic community. 

If you have a strong history of heart disease in your family, you can ask your primary care doctor to refer you to a cardiologist so you can get a cardiac stress test (walking/running on a treadmill hooked up to an EKG).  The entire test takes about an hour and can help see if there's any signs that suggest heart disease.  ",1
83,"Do you see a cardiologist? I think that would be the best person to talk to about what symptoms you should pay attention to and what you can safely ignore.

My dad had a heart attack last summer. He had chest pain, and his dad died of a heart attack, so he went to the hospital. Lucky him, because he was in the hospital with a cardiologist present when he actually had the heart attack. They were able to act very quickly, and that's probably why he didn't suffer any permanent damage. He has recovered fully.

The moral of that story being, consult a professional and do not screw around.",1
84,"If you're worried about breast cancer or heart attacks then you'll need to keep a watch out for signs and signals. Grab a card from your doctor about how to give yourself a breast exam and hang it in the shower (Just a simple lump test). You can check every day, or once a week. Whatever makes you feel comfortable.

While classic heart attack symptoms do occur, studies directed towards women's health show that they may not be present at all with heart attack in women. It may be helpful to familiarize yourself with both sets of symptoms.

100,"I've lived with them for decades. I'm not sure there is a ""why""; some people just get them while others don't, like hives or a stutter. 

One of the best bits of advice I ever got came from a therapist who used cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to help me with the attacks: Once they start, you can ease the symptoms, but the chemical cocktail that creates that sensation of panic takes some time to metabolize out of your bloodstream. Just thinking of it as a purely physical phenomenon -- just like sweating during exercise or getting itchy eyes after dusting -- really helped a lot. 

Thinking of them in milder terms has also made a big difference: not ""this is unbearable"" but ""this is unpleasant,"" not ""I can't stand this"" to ""this will end soon and I'll just breathe my way through it until then."" Catastrophizing the attacks, I've found, really ramps them up in intensity. I no longer think of a long-lasting, intense attack as ""the worst"" or ""so bad"" but as...well, long-lasting and intense. Using those less emotionally charged words to describe the episode helps me step back from feeling the panic and more toward observing it, if that makes sense. 

I still get panic attacks, and they aren't ever fun, but they've become far more manageable by seeing them as a physical symptom of a weird little quirk of my brain chemistry. Other things that help: 

- Focusing on my breathing
- Playing some inconsequential word game in my head
- A change of scenery during the attack
- Recalling past attacks and realizing I didn't have a heart attack during any of those episodes either

101,"I used to get them several times daily, now only once or twice a month. It very much feels like a heart attack, or just ""impending doom/death"" in general. The best thing for me is acknowledging and accepting the panic attack, trying to fight it just makes it worse. And distraction and deep breaths also. During a panic attack we tend to hyperventilate which in turn worsens symptoms like pounding heart, rapid pulse and shortness of breath. It's a vicious cycle. ",1
102,"When I started suffering from panic attacks in my early 20s I literally thought I was going to have a heart attack and die. Went to the hospital a few times because I believed I was dying in fact. I read this book and a few like it and found educating myself about the symptoms to be an important first step in realizing I could take back control of my body. Like some have already said, breathing deeply and slowly is helpful to me, knowing that by slowing my breathing mindfully I am also slowing my heart rate naturally. Give it a few minutes of focusing on breathing slowly and nothing else and then check in with yourself to see how you feel. I haven't had a real panic attack in 5+ years and seldom even feel high anxiety. Good luck to you!

Also, don't try to ""stop"" the panic attack - just be in the moment.  Say to yourself, ""I'm having a panic attack right now, but I'm not going to die or have a heart attack, plenty of people have these, and it's just my body thinking I need extra adrenaline, which I don't.""

Acknowledge that your heart is beating quickly, you know you can't die from it beating fast (after all you have had panic attacks before and you are still here) the heart is an amazingly strong and resilient organ. Also, I bet you couldn't make your heart beat faster even if you tried to.

Don't fight what is happening - that is the worst thing you can do, don't be impatient or try to force anything. Just accept it, think like you are floating above it, as though it wasn't really happening to you and let time pass. Before you know it the symptoms will have gone. That is the only way to break the anxiety > negative thoughts > adrenalin > increased anxiety cycle and it will help prevent it happening again in the first place.

So now (and before I started on meds) to cope I focus on breathing and try to look at something that's not related to my trigger. I tell myself (in my head) that this is just a false reaction. I'm not going to die. It's not this bad and it will pass. If I feel panic coming on I'll pretty much do the same thing. I try and talk myself down by using plain blunt statements. Things like my brain is overreacting, I'm not in any real harm, in 5 minutes this will be all over, breathe in breathe out nice and slow. ",1

Unfortunately my way of dealing with them probably won't help you because I don't get the heart attack sensation.

Reminding yourself that you're not dying, you're just panicking, is good.  Trying to concentrate on something that isn't the source of your panic helps.  During my last one, I got in the shower (not smart if you think you're going to pass out, but I've never had that happen) and started focusing really hard on getting the tangles out of my hair and getting clean.

One of my fav fun facts: Your body uses cholesterol to make bile (among other things), bile helps you digest fats, once your digested food and bile enter your intestines your body can absorb and recycle the bile for future use - BUT - if you eat a lot of fiber it get's trapped in you stool and gets eliminated. Then your gall bladder demands more cholesterol from your body and obtains it from your blood serum. Then blood serum levels of cholesterol go down. This is how eating OLD FASHIONED oats helps you reduce your cholesterol.

It can take a while for your period to settle down after stopping the pill, so don't worry if it doesn't return to normal right away.  Also, the first bleed is likely the withdrawal bleed, your body doesn't know if you've stopped altogether or just for the week.  Additionally, being on the pill shouldn't affect the result of a pregnancy test, so it's fine to just do the old pee-on-the-stick.

The advice from RememberYourPass refers to the combined pill, the mini-pill (progesterone only pill) is taken every day without breaks, and your period can remain normal, stop altogether, or anything in between.  Other methods can have different effects.

All things considered though, what every woman should know about contraception is: don't be afraid to ask your doctor (or whoever is prescribing) as many questions as you want about your contraceptive choices, including side effects, efficacy, method of action, effect on your period, and anything else that pops into your head.  There are no stupid questions.  The combined pill is most common, but far from the only option.  If you're not happy, go back and discuss it again.  If you don't think your doctor is listening to you, see somebody else.  Don't go without birth control just because the first method you tried didn't work out for you.",1

Therapy has taught me a lot of different coping mechanisms and ways to comfort myself when I’m in a panic attack and that’s what has helped the most. one thing that I do when I’m in having a panic attack is practice slow breathing and then identify my five senses -  something that I’m feeling, something that I’m seeing, something that I’m smelling, something that I’m tasting and something that I’m hearing.

175,"When they don’t listen. I have the ability to check my doctors’ write up after a visit, I use that to determine how well they are listening. I have several conditions which interact with each other in many ways so it is important to have a doctor who is at least knowledgeable of the strangeness my presentations incur. I have EDS, temporal lobe epilepsy, chronic orthostatic hypotension and symptomatic PVC’s and bouts of SVTs.

For example, I had a cardiologist (it was actually my second too) where I was discussing my experiencing supraventricular tachycardia and orthostatic tachycardia. I have my degree in exercise physiology and worked in cardiac rehab where it was my job to recognize certain rhythms. So anyways these are two very different rhythms, SVT is generally produced by atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia where the supraventricular node (below the normal firing node) begins firing rapidly at a rate of over 200bpm. This results in the electrical ‘spark’ of the heart coming from the center of the heart rather than above the right atria so there are very obvious EKG changes when this occurs that can be seen even on an Apple Watch Telemetry. It also generally lasts only about 60 seconds before normal sinus rhythm is reattained and you’ll see a space in the telemetry where you skip a beat before abruptly going from 200+bpm to whatever it was before.

Orthostatic tachycardia on the other hand is normal sinus rhythm but is unusually fast, generally just 100+bpm at rest and may present with extreme raises upon standing or moving. It can last a really long time, generally for me I’ll experience it for an hour or more, there is no clear cut begin or end for this, tends to come on gradually and leave the same way.

So I experience both of these individually and at different times/triggers. SVT occurs when I’m working out generally after an impactful movement (ie. Box jumps, fast squats) while OT can occur fairly randomly.

So I explained both of these to the doctor and he kept interrupting me going back and forth between the two and I could see he was getting mixed up and not really paying attention and wouldn’t even look at the Apple telemetry I had. He ultimately told me there was nothing he could do and that there were no cardiologists in the clinic I went to that treated EDS related cardiac issues. We’re talking a chain of over 6 locations so I found this highly skeptical.

When I reviewed his notes I found that he hadn’t separated the two conditions and instead reported that I experienced sinus tachycardia of 100+ bpm for a minute at a time upon standing. Which was not at all what I’d described. I sent a message to my current overseeing doctor pointing out the blatant errors in their reporting and she helped me get transferred to another cardiologist who was faaaar more helpful and thorough in their approach. 

He was the one who ended up diagnosing me with orthostatic hypotension and this was after 2 other cardiologists had just written off my symptoms. honestly I’m not sure why it hadn’t occurred to me because I’ve always had low BP but that’s why even other medical professionals work with doctors. He also helped me coordinate different lifestyle changes and now I’m managing it without even using medication. Although now I get to call coffee my medication (hehe). 

He also was open to discussing getting a cardiac ablation at some point to help the PVCs and SVT that I get. Something that no doctor has brought up, probably because I’m only 28 and I’ve found many doctors are highly resistant to admitting when young people have medical issues.

I also had my focal seizures ignored for four years with doctors telling me they were ‘weird panic attacks’ up until I hallucinated and had an extreme postictal state where I basically lost consciousness. Scared the shit out of my husband. Really pissed me off that my neurologist was immediately like, these sound like temporal lobe seizures. We need to run a full seizure panel, you may need to have an EMU stay, etc. and here I’d been dealing with these for years and thinking I was just really resistant to anxiety medication.

184,"I haven't had a heart attack, but since these stories are being shared I wanted to note the difference between cardiac arrest and a heart attack. My father had a heart attack without going into arrest and somehow this wasn't communicated to my brother or me so we didn't fully grasp what was happening, and I've since heard many people dismiss their symptoms because they don't match a movie scenario.

Below is an abbreviated version from the [American Heart Association](http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks/heart-attack-or-sudden-cardiac-arrest-how-are-they-different), but they have the full signs and symptoms of a heart attack or stroke on their website. As well as info on Hands-Only CPR. Hopefully okay to share here.

""People often use these terms interchangeably, but they are not synonyms. A heart attack is when blood flow to the heart is blocked, and sudden cardiac arrest is when the heart malfunctions and suddenly stops beating unexpectedly. A heart attack is a “circulation” problem and sudden cardiac arrest is an “electrical” problem.
 
Symptoms of a heart attack may be immediate and intense. More often, though, symptoms start slowly and persist for hours, days or weeks before a heart attack. Unlike with sudden cardiac arrest, the heart usually does not stop beating during a heart attack. The heart attack symptoms in women can be different than men.

Sudden cardiac arrest occurs suddenly and often without warning. It is triggered by an electrical malfunction in the heart that causes an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). With its pumping action disrupted, the heart cannot pump blood to the brain, lungs and other organs. Seconds later, a person loses consciousness and has no pulse. Death occurs within minutes if the victim does not receive treatment.""

185,"This question is SO IMPORTANT!!!! I haven’t, but in my life support class we learned it is a fact that heart attacks feel different for women than men. It’s not as widely known as it should be, but women need to know that a heart attack won’t feel/look like the classic signs. ",1
186,"I have not had a heart attack but I am a nurse who works in a hospital unit that deals with them on a regular basis :)

Just for clarification, as another Redditor pointed out, a ""heart attack"" is a term commonly applied to two different scenarios: a blockage in a coronary artery that causes heart muscle damage (myocardial infarction) OR when the heart isn't pumping blood properly and essentially stops (cardiac arrest), causing a person to essentially die unless someone helps (I.e. CPR +/- defibrillation). However, the two aren't necessarily exclusive - a myocardial infarction *can* cause a cardiac arrest if left untreated (though cardiac arrests aren't always caused by myocardial infarctions, and there are different types of cardiac arrests.....yeah, it's complicated lol).

So for this post, I'm going to assume ""heart attack"" to mean myocardial infarction, which is more common but harder to diagnose (because let's be real, if you go into cardiac arrest, you die, and that's not hard to miss).

The classic symptoms of a myocardial infarction are:

* Chest pain or pressure (often described as squeezing, like a band over the chest, or ""like an elephant sitting on the chest"")
* Pain radiating to the left arm and/or jaw
* Shortness of breath
* Nausea +/- vomiting
* Sweating
* Just generally feeling that something is very wrong

However, I've also seen lots of people say they had vague symptoms.

Most common of the subtle symptoms is the feeling of indigestion or heartburn. I can't count the amount of times I've heard the story of ""ate a big meal, went to bed, woke up with indigestion, took an antacid, and still felt like shit, continued to take antacids, and when I felt really unwell, went to the hospital."" The general rule of thumb I like to stick to is, if you're having heartburn and it won't go away with heartburn treatment, see a doctor. Even if it's ""just"" heartburn, you'll want to get it treated, anyway, because if left uncontrolled, it can damage your esophagus.

Other vague symptoms would be things like back pain, arm pain, nausea, intense fatigue, and dizziness. In fact, a couple of times, I've had patients who had no symptoms at all until we ran some tests on them; this is most common in people with diabetes.

While women are more likely to have the non-traditional signs and symptoms, men can have them, too, just like women can also have the classic signs. In fact, my first patient with a silent heart attack (no signs or symptoms) was a man!

So yeah, it's not very cut and dry but if you are ever concerned, please just call 911 (or whatever number you call for an ambulance) and get yourself to a hospital. Even if it turns out to be nothing, don't feel embarrassed or feel like you've wasted our time. We always take potential cardiac symptoms seriously because it's hard for us to tell, too, based on signs and symptoms alone, and the tests are fairly easy and quick. And  like a lot of other major ailments, it's best to get treated early rather than let it go on and on, potentially causing major damage.

Lastly, because I always get messaged, *please* no one ask me medical questions about you or a specific person. I cannot make assessments and give advice over the internet. If you have concerns about yourself or a loved one, please see a doctor in person.",1
187,"My mom had one last year and said it wasn't what men are known to experience at all.

The signs and symptoms are really variable across the board.

Quoted directly from the linked page from the American Heart Association:

>“Although men and women can experience chest pressure that feels like an elephant sitting across the chest, women can experience a heart attack without chest pressure, ” said Nieca Goldberg, M.D., medical director for the Joan H. Tisch Center for Women's Health at NYU’s Langone Medical Center and an American Heart Association volunteer. “Instead they may experience shortness of breath, pressure or pain in the lower chest or upper abdomen, dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting, upper back pressure or extreme fatigue.”

Or from the [Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.ca/heart/conditions/heart-attack):

>Women generally recognize the “Hollywood heart attack” with chest-clutching, crushing pain. If their pain is less severe, or if they have non-pain signs such as nausea, sudden fatigue or shortness of breath (signs more often reported by women), they are more likely to delay getting to emergency care, and once there, they are less likely to get fast, aggressive treatment.",1
190,"Realist, I suppose. Though I suspect that's what all pessimists consider themselves to be.

I seem to be significantly less emotional than most of my peers. I see all things rationally, I think that limits my ability to be romantic. I also work in health care where part of my job is attending all cardiac arrests and shutting down the life support. I see people die all the time, a lot. Apparently I am well suited to this line of work because even as a student it never really bugged me, while a lot of my classmates recall stories of driving home from a shift in tears because of a death they saw. 

This has never affected my ability to be compassionate, and I always do my best to give my patients the utmost care. But when they die I find myself feeling like that's just the way life goes. I see the chain of events that lead to it, I understand the medical reasons for it. I feel bad for the family's grieving process and how it will affect their lives moving forward. 

Its not a matter of me not understanding emotion. I can be very empathetic. I'm just not very sympathetic, perhaps. Life happens the way it happens. It doesn't always occur positively, but when it happens negatively I don't find myself very bothered.

Edit: Optimists downvoting me, perhaps? What if I told you all health care workers joke around during cardiac arrests, we aren't sobbing about it. If you deal with death day in and day out you stop caring so much.",1
191,"**Wall of text, sorry... but I believe I covered most things**

It's pretty standard to do an abdominal examination on top of a respiratory and cardiac examination when examining patients. Putting the stethoscope down around the abdomen gives one an idea as to whether or not the bowels are moving, which is a sign of bowel health. Bowel sounds aren't always heard right off the bat, so sometimes one has to move the stethoscope around (the recommendation is to listen for up to 1-5minutes depending on the resource... but nobody ever has that much time). A proper abdominal examination has to expose the area up until slightly above the pelvic region.

Some materials are harder to listen through, and it's not so much the thickness of it every time. I find it easy enough to listen through say something like cotton, but through some swishy fabrics and the like, I can't hear jack shit, and will require access underneath it. Occasionally, the bra/breasts can interfere with a cardiac exam, if they're too big, which in turn prevents the stethoscope from being placed in the appropriate areas. 

Him calling in the nurse was supposed for legal purposes; she's there to attest to the fact that everything he did was a part of a normal medical examination, and that there was no funny business going on. You'd be surprised how damaging a false accusation can be, and as a result, many doctors now are a bit apprehensive. Many robes are designed to open up at the back actually, and are supposed to be put with the un-opened end at the front, and the slit/opening at the back... kind of like putting on a coat on backwards; the typical blue/white ones that you see in many north american hospitals are designed as such. It sounds to me like you might have put it on backwards.

He came from behind so that he'd have an easier time listening to the lungs. It's personal preference whether one listens to the lungs from the back or front, but the heart sounds can make listening from the front a bit harder, so many like to listen from the back, then go back to the front for the cardiac and abdominal exam. It has nothing to do with looking at your panties. 

There are lots of sounds that one can check for/make sure is normal in the abdomen, including the flow of blood to your kidneys, the aorta down there, and the like. He's technically not listening to your heart over there, but there are parts of a typical cardiac exam that are performed outside of what the general public associates with the heart (i.e. outside of the immediate chest). It was likely done as part of a global examination. 

The wires that they stick to the body... does the term EKG or ECG sound familiar? Or Heart Exam? He might have heard an incidental sound when listening to the heart, and ordered an ECG (which is an electrical tracing of the heart, as the electricity surges through various aspects of it) to see if he could pick up an abnormality. As a clinician, while it's nice to get the report from the technician who does it, some of us like to see the ECG tracing itself to verify. Yes it has to be topless, because the wires cross all over the chest... it's measuring electric currents across the heart, which incidentally happens to be placed in the chest. Putting things on top of the wires, moving around during the read, or even crossing wires in some shittier machines, can cause artefacts which ruin the ""image""/result. Judging by the fact that he asked for her to bring it back to him, suggests that he's sending your sister away to do it... which is consistent with normal medical practice. He's having a technician do it. If he wanted to molest your sister, you'd think he'd want to do it himself so that he would have more opportunities to access your sister's chest, no?

Sometimes it's easier to just tell patients that you're listening to something else than what you are actually listening for, so that they don't get confused. They don't have the training or knowledge to understand why a sound in the abdomen can be related to the heart, so to make things easier, some people just say ""heart sounds"" etc., as a general encompassing term. If I said ""oh, I'm just going to check to see if you have a triple A or dissection,"" you'd probably be confused, so it would make both our lives easier if I just said ""I'm going to listen for a heart sound or aorta sound down here."" The confusion behind what he was doing can lead to misunderstanding; in the future, if you feel uncomfortable, just ask them what they are listening/checking for, and they can explain to you in better detail. 

Multiple patients in the room, technically shouldn't be done, but often is given time constraints and practicality. Depending on how important it is to get a clear sound on that particular organ, one may choose to just cursory listen over the clothes, or may feel the need to get firm contact between the stethoscope and skin (the sound improves significantly in some cases). If for example, you come in with something I believe is clearly abdominal in origin, I might give your heart and lungs a cursory listen just to make sure nothing big is going on there...and for that I probably would just quickly do it over the clothes, barring any thick/undesirable fabric. If he stayed in the room while you were undressing, he was probably just in a rush to get the exam over with so he could see the next patient, filling out paper work, or a variety of other things. As to gloves, if it's just to do a superficial exam (i.e. I don't have to stick any fingers into any orifices, you aren't bleeding/oozing fluids, and there aren't any lesions/infections on the skin), some people may just wash their hands and go at it (it's a preference thing, as gloves reduce tactile sensation and can get in the way of things). The filthier it is, the more likely most doctors are to put on gloves (to protect both you and them). 

Since it was your first time at this clinic, it was likely that he was trying to do a baseline of all your organ systems, so that in the event that something new happens (i.e. Oh no, my chest hurts... and he examines it and hears a new sound in there that based on a previous exam wasn't there, he has a pretty good idea that something pretty big might have happened) he has something to compare to. Follow up appointments are nice, because they're usually faster as one can pretty much just verify ""no change"" occurred in non-involved organs. 

Based on what you described, it honestly doesn't sound like anything inappropriate occurred. If anything, it was most likely a miscommunication. If you feel strongly about it though, you can always lodge a complaint against him, though if based on his previous history and performance it appears unlikely that he did anything, it likely will be acknowledged and thrown out. You'd be surprised how often doctors get accused of something malicious, when in reality it was standard practice or a procedure that was just poorly communicated. Busy physicians unfortunately do not take the time to explain to patients what they are going to do, which can be confusing and alarming to patients, when simple reassurance is all that's needed.",1

See [newyeornewme's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/6n4van/vegan_women_if_you_raised_your_own_backyard/dk8cfvo/) for info. Perhaps genetics have more to do with cholesterol, but that does not mean that the food you eat has no effect on it. It stands to reason that someone who avoids eating too much cholesterol likely has healthier levels than someone who doesn't, if they're coming from the same genetic risk.

The thinking now is that the culprit is sugar. I can say anecdotally that when I excised sugar (added and natural) from my diet, and upped my fat intake (including eggs and cheese and bacon), my triglycerides fell by half in a couple months. Good cholesterol went up and bad cholesterol went way down, making my ratio better.  (Side benefit - weight loss!)

My eyebrows had perfect strokes that matches the hair exactly when they were done. I followed aftercare exactly, but they lost that hair stroke look and now look more like makeup or tattooed. They also haven't faded at all, which I have mixed feelings about. [These photos](https://imgur.com/a/bvaPitG) are over two years apart. 

Last thing is to be sure you know exactly how close together you want them. Strokes can be added in the touch up but not taken away. I was so focused on the shape and I thought there was a standard of going straight up from the inner eye, nope. My brows are in line with current beauty standards, but closer together than I prefer and they also are more permanent than I originally expected.",1

I didn’t think it would make a huge difference to be honest, because I asked her to just keep it natural. 

I LOVE it. I’ve had it topped up twice (over two years) and it looks great. 
They really do look like hair strokes, and even though I will still gently outline my brows when I do full Glam, I love that I can run out barefaced and still have some definition. It really makes me feel more confident and gives structure .
Also I feel like any brow tinting seems to last longer (obviously it doesn’t but having the base colour seems to make a diff)

Pain wise, I’d probably say a low 6/10? The actual scalping bit didn’t hurt too much, but the ink stung quite a lot. 
For reference, I’d rate Botox a 2/10 and filler a high 4/10. 

If you’re thinking about doing it, I’d say go for it, but be aware that over time the lines can bleed so they look less like hair strokes and more smudged? I don’t know how else to describe it, but it’s no different than filling it with pencil or powder IMO.

210,"I got microshading done which is just manual shading and strokes. I absolutely LOVED the result but I found that after the healing process I had lost quite a bit of the pigment. Luckily a touch up was included in the price that I paid and when I went in the second time, the pigment stuck a little better. 

After a few months the definition of some of the strokes wore off, which was disappointing but sort of expected considering that I have combination skin that tends to lean towards oily. So I did find myself filling in my brows again within a few months, but I at least had a shape to follow which makes the whole process of doing my makeup much faster. 

It’s been a year now and overall I’m satisfied with how it turned out for me. The hair strokes have faded almost completely but the shading is still there, albeit somewhat faded, but I still feel like it makes a HUGE difference.

The only cons I can think of are 1.) the price, it’s expensive! 2.) it’s not totally permanent and you may or may not be happy with your final outcome depending on your skin tip and whether you decide on manual or machine work 3.) the healing process kind of sucks. It gets really itchy and your brows will look like trash for at least a week, and you can’t put anything on them in the meantime to cover it up.

I’ve been wanting to go back to get my yearly touch up and maybe upgrade to hybrid brows (manual stokes and machine blading, much better suited for oily skin types) but haven’t been able to because of COVID.",1
211,From all the pictures of the work she had done I always liked the look of those the most. It’s sort of the best of both worlds as there’s strokes to mimic the look of individual brow hairs and the tattoo part sort of filled in around the micro blading and my natural brows.,1

I spend about about $200 a year on Anastasia eyebrow pencils and it takes about 5 minutes or so to do my brows. So, I’m just filling in my brows again. I want to do something more permanent but not sure what. 
You will probably like how it looks because the tech will out line your brow and mark the strokes in the brow. The hardest part is it won’t last a year.",1

very sharp. A men's razor is a really good option for those who are very hairy. Don't cheap out and over use with your razor. Replace frequently. 

-Shave slowly, one small stroke at a time making sure to rinse your razor with every stroke so it won't clog. 

- Shave with the grain/down strokes the whole way through, then add much more cream to shave in longer up strokes for the closest shave. 

- I don't recommend the foams in a can, Conditioner smooths the hair making it easier to to shave so you won't have to apply unnecessary pressure. Olay body ribbons is a great option too.

- Most importantly do NOT shave very short stubble. I'm not sure why, but it almost always causes the razor burn and ingrown hairs to shave that way. Wait for there to be some length before shaving again, your results will be much softer and smoother that way.",1

He should thrust in me the way I tell him to based on how I'm feeling at the moment, or to match the mood of the sexual encounter, or however the spirit moves him.

That said, I do like variety and sometimes I'm more in the mood for one thing than another. Also, position/angle, his penis size, etc. will affect what feels good. 

But when I'm closer to orgasm, I prefer a fast stroke against my g-spot, so there's less need for him to go deep/long. I orgasm easiest when I squeeze my thighs together (with his legs on the outside of mine), so that tends to limit his thrusting ability mainly to the entrance of my vagina.

Beautifully put.

The motions and the rhythm depend on the situation. There is no one holy grail, no one glove that fits all.

I generally don't like shallow short strokes much though. I emotionally and physically prefer him to remain relatively deep in me at all times. It's not important how far he actually reaches into me; I just like the feeling of having all of him in me and there not being much space between us left.

Funnily enough, my neurologist who I saw for migraines knew I was on the pill and never blinked at it. It’s only ever been GYN providers who were not well versed. 

I definitely have gotten super annoyed in the past because **pregnancy** is not without risk for stroke either. So, overall I’d rather take my chances with the pill. ",1

Last year, my hormones were totally out of whack. I was acting like a psychopath and my migraines have never been worse. It got to the point where I was experiencing confusion, I couldnt form basic sentences and I forgot very simple words that we say often. Like ""where"" or ""about"". 

A whole year went by before I figured out what was happening. It turned out that I had an extremely serious issue in my body that was making my hormone levels fluctuate like crazy. Once I had surgery, my hormones went back to normal over time and my migraines decreased significantly.

I'm pretty sure estrogen has a lot to do with pain receptors in the brain (hence the stroke-like symptoms I was experiencing) which is why some BC is too risky. But I could be wrong. 

The body is so wild. People don't pay enough attention to their hormones and they should. They're indicators when something isn't right.",1

He also gives me ""giraffe kisses.""  If you've ever seen how a giraffe uses its lips to grip something or ""lip"" on something, he does that to me but with kisses.  It makes me laugh.

We also hold hands and face each other, so sometimes he kisses my forehead or pulls my thigh up so it's on his waist.  My favorite is when he rubs my back or strokes my hair.  Sometimes he'll just rest his hand on my head and it makes me calm and sleepy immediately.

I paid personal bills of theirs to the tune of about $2,000.00 including medical, tire repairs on her car and even groceries. I spent several days helping to care for him for the first few days.

She accused me of not allowing my father to be in a extended care facility and that I stopped him from going (we were actually waiting a few days on insurance company to approve placement - had nothing to do with me. This was explained to her by several people on the medical staff) While at their house helping with care, my father's wife then argued with me about stopping him from going and it was MY fault and she was ""number 1"". The argument included her asking me if I wanted my father to die and ordering me out of her house (and threatening to call the police if I do not leave.) Shocked beyond measure I left.

Not too long after that he was admitted to the facility for a few weeks. He came home permanently after that. I then brought my wife over to sort of mediate a discussion between us, but that did not accomplish anything. I went back to my father's room and said goodbye.

You can't just expect them to go 0-100 and outright shame them about their feelings, because you're just gonna make them feel crappy and see you as an asshole. Tough love has a place/time.",1
261,"That's a hard one, without knowing her or her background / mannerisms very well.

Personally I'm ok with physical affection within a relationship or with people you've established intimacy with. It DOES take probably more time to get to a certain level, or won't be as common, or will have certain things generally off-limits. PDA, for people who are more private or already not generally physical, can be a very gradual bridge to cross, again with limits.

But expressing affection physically (in one way or another) is very powerful and connecting, and if one partner needs a certain type of level of it, there needs to be a thoughtful and empathic conversation around respecting the needs AND boundaries of BOTH partners - Is she / can she compromise or work on giving you more? Does she acknowledge that there's a rift between you? How much can you be without, or is there a deal-breaker limit? Is it something she can / should / wants to work on?

Her basically saying she believes expressions of affection always have selfish alternative motives with no positive side makes me wonder if she's had dishonest people in her life, has experienced or seen unfaithfulness in what were very ""lovey-dovey"" relationships, or has insecurities / trust issues / reflexively keeps protective walls around herself and her connections with others. Those scenarios need to be approached carefully to avoid just accusing and putting her on the defensive. But I do think you should make clear to her that you don't ""need your ego stroked"", but do need to understand what her ""love language"" is (perhaps she doesn't even know? try both taking a simple quiz online), and for her to respect yours.",1
262,"Brute force and ignorance.

I bought some pens (if you’re a lefty, make sure to get either straight nibs, or ones slanted for lefties; most stores only sell right slanted ones so you might have to special order them), and I downloaded a few sheets of practise strokes from the internet. Then I just did the strokes over and over and over and over and over while listening to the TV.

Eventually I bought Marc Drogin’s book on medieval calligraphy (shhh! Some purists don’t like this one! But it was fine for me), and started practising the variations.",1
263,"Well for her shes absolutely fantastic in bed and with blowjobs she has amazing enthusiasm and is great with her mouth.  With her hands she sometimes doesn't grab and stroke the right part.  She strokes too close to the base of the shaft. Then if i move her hand to the right part (higher up on the shaft, closer to the head) she strokes it a little too fast.  I'm thinking about saying something about it but don't wanna fuck up her confidence. Any ideas? ",1
264,"Ha, I used to do this too. Really, there's no harm in giving a sexy demo in how you like to be stroked, or putting your hand over hers to guide her. 

If you don't want to hurt her confidence, use positive reinforcement or instructions instead of criticisms!  For example, you could say, ""Could you try...?"" and guide her hand, then go, ""Fuck yes, stroke me like that"" when she tries it. If she does go too fast again, maybe say a simple ""Slow, baby,"" instead.",1
265,"I had a medication that gave me ocular migraines as a side effect. Pepcid of all things. It's a really common otc med and apparently I'm like one in a million, but there we are.

[This is the best visualization I've seen of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8P_ZTJqv8g) it's pretty spot on though mine took up a much larger field of view after about half an hour and lasted for a really long time. A few hours at least. 

Terrifying the first few times it happened- wasn't able to drive home. Had to have someone pick me up from work. After a couple times they got kind of entertaining. I never had pain or nausea associated with it though I have gotten other migraines for years that certainly do- just no visuals. So I'd be at work and be like ""it's starting again"" and kinda play with my blind spot until someone picked me up to go home (I could not work without being able to see and it would last several hours). They stopped a few days after I stopped taking pepcid. Haven't gotten em since. 

I really feel for people who have them on a regular basis. It's no joke. I was effectively blind. Combine that with the common pain symptoms after and fuck that noise. Either is shit enough on it's own. Both is just the universe poopin' on your face. ",1
266,"Only once. It was my worst one to date. I didn't realize it was an aura at the time. It was like there was a white spot in my right eye that wouldn't go away. I thought it was just my eyes or brain bugging out because I was in a white room looking at white papers at the time. Then the pain started. I eventually drove myself home, threw up from the nausea, and laid in bed crying from the pain until I was finally able to pass out.",1
267,"I lose vision in my peripherals and if I don't take some Advil extra strength asap, I will get  nauseous and likely pass out. I don't ever get any other symptoms of a migraine because it goes straight from aura to passing out. Usually caused by low blood pressure because I forgot to eat, or staring at a screen too long (both go hand in hand for me since I work at a computer and often forget to eat while doing so).",1
268,"Yeah for me migraine is usually just the aura, with a bit of a headache.

Sometimes my first sign will be that I am squinting and straining to see my work in a way I usually don’t. 

Then it will start as a little blurry patch with distorted colours, that looks a bit like when you get a drop of water on your phone screen. This gradually expands and slides down my vision. Eventually a good portion of my vision will be obscured. 

I can get around but not see details. Trying too hard to focus and get stuff done during this time can start/worsen a headache and sometimes make me feel a little nauseous. It’s a real nuisance.

Takes about 2 hours from first hint of blurryness to it passing.",1
269,"I had this only one time, when I was pregnant. I had no idea what was going on. I just had this spot in my vision that was very persistent and wouldn't go away. I know this sounds crazy, but I was starting to think someone had slipped me acid in my food or something and I was starting to get really bad anxiety about it. Then the headache hit and I did some googling and realized it was just a migraine. It has never happened since, but wow that was a weird and horrible experience.",1
270,"I've had three aura migraines in my life. They were by far the worst I've ever felt. I realised the trigger was dehydration and running on a hot day (all were shortly after track practice ended in the summer) so I just drank more water.

When the aura first starts it just seems like a spot in my vision, primarily on my right side. I could still see it with my left eye if I covered up my right, and things behind it were able to be seen, but not clearly. Like when you glance at a bright light for a moment and for the next few seconds you have a blind spot in your vision. But the spot grew bigger and bigger over time and seemed to look like static on a television if I concentrated on it, and formed a backwards C. Eventually the C would grow bigger and bigger until I couldn't see it anymore, as if it had passed by me of it were physically real. Once it disappeared from my vision, the migraine hit. I had intense pain from my neck to my forehead, pounding, throbbing and sharp. I felt dizzy, nauseous and weak. Once I saw the aura I had about 40 minutes to get to an appropriate place for the migraine to hit, and all I could really do was wait it out.

It sucked so hard. And when I figured out I just had to drink more water I smacked myself in the forehead like ""could I be so stupid? That's it?"" Thank God that was it.  ",1
271,"Yes, since the age of 13. Mine start with a dot like you get after a camera flash, then slowly go from one side of my eyes to the other. At first, it’s small, then it gets bigger with each pass and it is shaped like a zig-zagged greater than/less than sign. Where ever it is, I can’t see, so I have a blind spot- it can last from 15 minutes up to an hour depending on circumstances. When they get to their largest and disappear, most times that’s when the pain hits, like a sledgehammer- I’ve had it knock me to my knees and start throwing up wherever I’m standing. 

On the worst ones, my arm and face tingle and go numb and I slur my words or I think correctly but what I say doesn’t come out right. 

Now they call them hemiplegic migraines. 

When I was 22, I had a full on stroke due to taking birth control pills and the severity of my migraines. I lost the use of my right side and had to do a lot of therapy to get it back and speak again. 

I tell everyone I know to not take birth control if they have migraines.

 Barometric pressure is a big one for me, stress, msg and I am very light, sound and smell sensitive. I use a thing called f.lux on my comp to adjust the light because I can see the fluctuations on the white patterns and it drives me batty. I put it to “candlelight” on all times so I don’t have the brightness to deal with.",1
272,"I get them a lot. 

I get light sensitivity and an absent ringing in my ears (like the sensation of ringing, but without the sound... it’s hard to explain). Then it starts with slight pressure, like I tied a ponytail too tight. Then it escalates to a full on headache then a migraine. 

My migraines are scary though. The worst has stroke-like symptoms. They thought I might be having TIAs but that got ruled out. I get vision problems, tingling on one side, speech problems (though it’s due to the pain and I can fight through it if I try), all while having the actual migraine headache. ",1
273,"Yes, I've gotten them periodically throughout my life since childhood. 

I get something called a [scintillating scotoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillating_scotoma) that completely obstructs a good portion of my vision to the point where I can't see certain things. It's like having an obstructive object in my way and can't see the things behind it. You know that bright light you get in your eyes when you look at the sun for too long, but it eventually goes away? It's like that, but it doesn't diminish after a minute or two...it stays for the duration of the migraine. 

I also get pretty bad expressive aphasia. When I was 8, I remember my mom taking me to the ER for these migraines (she thought I was having a stroke...which they present similarly to), and my mom kept asking me all kinds of questions and wouldn't leave me alone. Instead of wanting to communicate to her, ""Mom, can you please be quiet"" the words that came out of my mouth were, ""Mom, why are you so bald?"". I had the thought in my head that I wanted to say, however completely different message comes out. It's a very frustrating and powerless feeling tbh. Sometimes it gets as bad as a jumbled up word salad. [This]( https://youtu.be/AVKDm4PhEwI) is actually a perfect example of what happens to me. 


The next strange symptom I get is this approximately 2x2 square patch of numbness that arises at my finger tips of one hand, and slowly rises up my arm (but only in the 2x2 patch..I regain sensation again to the places where the square patch started out after it migrates upward) until it hits that shoulder of the arm it started out on. Then, it will cross over to the opposite shoulder and make its way down to my fingertips, to which it stops completely once it's there. Very weird shit. 

Lastly, and probably the weirdest thing for people to understand, is that I don't get a headache with my migraines...like, at all. No nausea either. 

They're debilitating for me though, because I can't function properly even though they don't cause me pain. I can't communicate, see, and am generally not pleasant to be around when I have one. I'm lucky that if I catch it when it's starting early some extra strength advil is enough to stop it in its tracks. However, if I wait till it progresses I'm screwed and am completely useless for like 6 hours until it goes away on its own. I hate them, because they've stopped me from being able to safely take estrogen based oral contraceptives (which is like 99% of them). Thank goodness they're not very common for me though...*knocks on wood*.

Edit: Another common term for my type of migraine with aura is a hemiplegic migraine. ",1
274,"Yes. It wasn't painful until the aura went away, then it was nausea and the worst pain with no way to stop it. This happened 2 times a week and went on for months. I finally told my Dr who realized I was having a bad reaction to the BC pill Azurette. She pulled me of it right away because this aura migraines were a sign I would soon have a stroke. The migraines stopped as soon as I stopped taking the pills. ",1
275,"This is why estrogen based oral contraceptives are black box contraindicated. If you've had an aura migraine, even once, and take estrogen based birth control then your chances of having a stroke from the birth control (normally an incredibly rare side effect) hike up quite a bit.",1
276,"Yes, it's truly horrible. I commend you for staying calm and just googling, I ran straight to the doctor in horror. I had some other symptoms though, like a stroke.",1
277,"I'm sorry you had to experience this. Have you recovered completely? I read online that migraines with aura are connected to a higher risk for strokes. I think it's great that you warn others of the dangers of the pill. It's important that more women know that the pill is not harmless as it's made out to be. 

I use f.lux as well, it's much better on the eyes.",1
278,"They are terrifying. I mentioned it to my eye doctor and he immediately said that all his patients said how horrible it was. If you don't know what's happening, it's like a stroke.

Interesting, I never had any symptoms before I got my migraine attacks. They were caused by the pill, so they only ever came about during the one week when I stopped taking them. Maybe that's why I didn't have symptoms before. I had only two migraines with aura so far, all the other ones were ""just"" headache migraines.

Yes, headaches are a very nasty kind of pain. ",1
279,"I never heard of such a reaction to peanuts, but it doesn't seem that unlikely to me. 

Did you know that there is a theory that peanut allergies are actually a reaction to a very high amount of aflatoxines (mold) that is present in bad peanuts? It's a bit obscure and I only read it in passing, but I found it interesting.",1
280,It was weekly when I switched to Sprintec. Looked up symptoms online. Saw the word “stroke.” Panicked and called my doctor. My cousin had a stroke at 25 and they believe it was her birth control. Not happening to me.,1
281,"It really is. The only way I can get rid of them is to lie down in a dark, quiet room and pass out for a little while. OTC pain medications don't even touch it. Luckily I don't get them that often anymore.",1
282,"Yes, that's also what my family said. I went to the doctor the same day I had it and he immediately sent me to the hospital. Well, a stroke at 25 is extremely early, that's certainly something to be aware of. 

What is Sprintec? ",1
283,"Sit on my butt and recover. I worked my tushie off a few days ago in my yard. 9AM to 3PM. For a lot of things, there is no setting between Off and On and I got a bit heat stroked and made it worse by not stopping till I was done.

So..plans for the day? Sit.",1
284,"I do and I really hate things like *stroke* are talked like as if it's nothing because it doesn't happen to most women who are on BC. It happens to zero woman who uses condoms.

Most women in my life tried BC at one point. EVERY one of them experienced at least one side effect, waited to get to use it, around 7 out of 10 of them didn't and stopped using it.",1
285,">. It happens to zero woman who uses condoms.

Uh, are you saying stroke is not considered a potential side effect of condoms? Because whilst that's true, you can definitely have a stroke outside of being on the pill. 


The risk for stroke in pregnancy is between 10-18 per 100 000 [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3137888/). The risk for stroke on the pill is 8 per 100 000 [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2634299/). Therefore, if you use condoms and they fail you have a greater risk of stroke than if you were on the pill.",1
286,"I meant condoms don’t have a side effect like stroke, obviously. Also the pill can fail too.",1
287,"Sure the pill can fail, but it's perfect use and typical use failure rate is significantly better than condoms. 

Unless you have a family history, migraines or you smoke, then your risk of stroke is essentially 'nothing'. ",1
288,"But it’s not nothing. My friend’s mother had a stroke, yes, but years after her daughter was on BC pills.  There are people who get misdiagnosed about the type of headache they have, etc. So they’re not even aware they’re actually in the “Unless...” group. And then there are other side effects. I get it’s the best option for some, everyone’s own choice anyway but re: the OP, I don’t think the side effects of BC are reported or talked enough.",1
289,">But it’s not nothing

At a risk of 0.00008% for most people it's negligible. Having a stroke is a tragedy, but for the vast majority of people stroke risk from the pill is negligible. Especially when you consider the rate of overall stroke is 545/100 000 [source]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4125206/). 

Do you warn women about getting pregnant because of the increased risk of stroke?",1
290,"I lost my dad two weeks ago due to complications from a stroke. Here are the things I wish I had told him, or asked him (he couldn't speak due to a tracheotomy in his last few weeks):

* His favourite story from my childhood

* His favourite recipe, meal, dessert etc

* Places he would have liked to travel 

* Favourite place he travelled in the past 

* Favourite girl and boy names 

* Told him how much I loved him, how thankful I've always been to have him as my dad and that I hope one day I can be as good a person as he was. How deeply I wished I could have taken his pain away. 

* Ask if they would like to have a specific song played at the funeral. 

* Take pictures of him and with him. Record him saying I love you. Record him telling a story.

* Favourite book, film, song etc

Some of these things you might already know about your mum. I never asked if he wanted certain things at his funeral because his death was pretty unexpected. I told him I loved him when I visited him in the hospital, but I never told him I was thankful and so proud to be his daughter because I didn't want him to think I thought he would die. Now I wish I had somehow expressed my deep love and gratitude more clearly. 

I wish you and your family the best. 

Edit: Ask your mother what her wishes are regarding her remains: does she want to get buried or cremated etc. It was difficult for me thinking there's only ashes left of my dad but that's what he wanted. ",1
291,"I lost my mum this past summer.  Seeing as I am thinking about possibly having kids in the future I wish I had asked her about what it was like for her during her pregnancy. What are some of her favorite times with me as I was growing up. I found an old photo album of hers after she passed and I'm lucky because she kept lots of notes with the pics but I would've liked to just know more about her before she was a mum. Sometimes we forget our parents had lives before us and I would like to know that person, the young lady with a lead foot, the girl who was engaged before my dad stole her away.....

293,"Coming from a banker's aspect here.  If she can, try to take her to all the banks where her assets are kept.  Get to know a representative while adding yourself to all (ALL) her accounts.  Even if your father or someone else is a joint signer on the accounts, I'd still get yourself on them.  Get the information for all the important (non-family) members in her life and make sure they know about what's going on as well: the accountant, the family attorney, even doctors, etc., should all know who you are.  Due to confidentiality and legality reasons, it's easier to do things while a person is still alive and becomes a whole lot more complicated and labor-intensive after date of deceased.  

Basically, if an account only has your mother's name on it after she's passed, it almost always *has* to go to an estate account, which requires additional documentation and usually done through the courts.

Best of luck to you, my prayers are with you and your family.",1
294,"Hey there OP. 

I truly feel for what you and your family are going through. My Mom passed away when I was 14, breast cancer. I'm 21 now, and when I think about my future, I can't help but grieve that it won't involve my Mom. 

I would have loved for my Mom to write me letters that I could open with advice during major events in my life- high school and college graduation, first heartbreak, engagement, wedding day, first born, etc. 

Something else to consider: when my Mom passed away my Dad got a copy of her index fingerprint from the hospital and then had it put on a necklaces for me and my siblings. I wear the necklace everyday and run my finger over it whenever I'm missing her. 

Feel free to PM me anytime if you want to talk more. ",1
295,"All of the suggestions here have been wonderful, and I don't believe my mine will add much.  

I would suggest that you continue to just be present.  There really isn't anything to do when loved ones are in the process of leaving us but be there with them.  Dying, of course, is not something to be avoided but another part of life to be cherished.  It is as important as giving birth, a first kiss, marriage, having children, and seeing them grow.   Your being present in the moment will help your mother to also be present.  Your fearlessness will provide comfort and help her to pass in serenity.  Sometimes the dying are worried about being a burden.  Try to enjoy these moments so that she too enjoys them.  ",1
296,"Sorry to hear about what you are going through.  I would record her- ask her questions about her family, what it was like growing up.  There is a really great book (sorry I'm at work and don't have it handy) that we used with my great grandmother.  We just recorded us chatting with her, asking her these questions, like a normal conversation.  20 years later, it's awesome to have those tapes of her talking about her childhood and talking about her life and her family and the world.  

Love is always a great topic.  Ask her to talk about how her and your father met (even if you already know the story, have her tell you again).  Ask things like how it made her feel.  Ask what are some funny things they did together.  Ask what her advice would be if you were getting married or having kids or whatever you have left in life that she won't be there to experience that you want to accomplish.  

If you aren't able to video record, at least record her voice speaking with you.  

When I was very little, I had gotten a tape recorder for Christmas and I was recording Christmas at my grandparents.  I found the tape about 10 years later and listened to it.  By this point my grandpa had unexpectedly passed away.  The tape was pretty ""normal"" just all of my cousins and everyone talking through the day- us being kids.  Then it got to the end of the tape- the very last thing before the tape ended was our family leaving for the day and my grandpa's voice saying, ""mablesyrup, come over here and give me a kiss and a hug goodbye"".  I cried for days.  ",1
297,"I think a lot of people are forgetting the most important thing. I would love to ask my mom millions of questions, but most of all I would tell my mom how much I love her and cherish the time with her. I knew my mom would pass, but I never thought it would be real. My mom had a really slow decline and passed the day day before Thanksgiving this past year. Just cherish your mom OP and have light hearted conversation with her and make a memory. ",1
298,"Record her voice. It's been said before, but record it. Record her saying how much she loves you, saying things like happy birthday and Merry Christmas, and copy it to the point where you have dozens of copies in the house. 

Ask her about her most favorite moment with you when you were a baby, then ask about her most frightening moment. 

Ask her what she regrets. Chances are, she regrets something with you or in her life you can fulfill or tell her she doesn't need to regret, because you are okay. 

Hug her. Oh my gosh, hug her tight and try to memorize her body heat. Her kiss on your cheek. Try to remember her smells. They'll fade with time unless you box specific things away for safe keeping. And even then, the memory of her warmth will fade unless you have an excellent memory. 

Video her, if you want to remember her in her current state. My biggest regret with my Mother's passing was that I always listened to her complaints of hating being on camera, and recorded other people in the room instead. Now I watch those videos wishing I had turned the camera just a little, just enough to catch her in it.

299,"Family history.

Several months before my grandmother passed, my uncle hauled out his video camera and the family photo albums and recorded her going through them stating who was in the photo and, if she knew, the story behind the photo. For the most part, that is the only family history I have. While I knew some of it back then (1985) time has taken a toll on those memories.

We tried to do the same with my mother when her health started declining. She refused because she believed that we thought she would soon die (she was present when my uncle taped their mother). Her body was failing, not her mind at that time. Long story short, she remained in relatively decent health for several more years before having a stroke. Sadly, with the exception of the eldest, the only memories her grandchildren will have of her is a woman who was sick and could barely speak. If she had let us record when we asked, they would see the strong woman she was. Not to mention they will not know who many of the people are in the photos from almost a 100 years ago because we aren't sure (by time I got interested in family history there weren't many left to ask).

God knows how much family history has been lost/forgotten.",1

My mom, aunts, and uncles always tell these great stories whenever they get together about their childhoods, their parents, their dog, their school, old flames, cross-country road trips, crazy great-aunts that passed long ago, etc, etc. Also some old family histories about my grandmother's family in Northern Ireland and my grandfather's family adventures in Atlantic City during Prohibition. They always talk about writing it all down, but they never do. I'm currently trying to record some of them with my mom, we'll see how it goes!

- Record her laugh.  Either just audio, or if you're both comfortable with a camera, a video.  I miss the way my grandma's eyes sparkled just like a little girl when she laughed.

- Ask for a letter or recording of why she's proud of you.  Something to give encouragement to get you through the hard times in life.

303,"My mom passed away last summer, and I think constantly about what I should have asked and said.  I'm in my late twenties and dating is a weird thing - I wish I had asked her more about her relationships, both with my Dad and before him.  What made her swoon, what drove her away, what did she look for and what did she put up with?  I wish I had asked her about how sad she was when her Grandma died or when her Dad killed himself.  I was there for both, but she just put on such a brave front for my brother & I that I have no idea what her grief was like or how she learned to cope.  That would help me so much now.  And I'd ask what she wanted to know from me.  I'd answer any question with open honesty.  ",1

I bought a book similar to [this](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/all-about-my-grandmother-alex-a-lluch/1016203918?r=1&ean=9781934386606&kpid=9781934386606&cm_mmc=GooglePLA-_-Book_Under5-_-Q000000633-_-9781934386606) and that really helped to lead the conversation and can give you specific ideas on questions to ask. You can write down the answers or better yet record them so you can hear them in her voice. Unfortunately, I did this too late. I thought I had more time, but she was too weak and couldn't answer much.

My mom hated having video taken or her picture taken while she was sick because she didn't want to be remembered as a cancer patient, but we got a video of her on the last day she was really lucid. We took her outside and had lunch and she was smiling. I watch it all the time and she's right, I wish I had some video of her where she looked like the woman I remember and not my mom with cancer. That said...I'll cherish that video forever.

Along with that video, the only other recording I have of her voice is her voicemail message. My husband was able to get that off of her cell phone after she passed away for all of us.

A big help was my aunt. She made me a photo album of my mom when she was younger and I always have it nearby. Ask around for photos from your family members because they may have some that you've never seen.

In the present - just make sure you're there with her as much as possible. I gave my mom a little manicure and painted her nails while she was in bed. She always liked to have polish on her nails.

If you don't know already, you may want to ask her what she wants after she passes away. My mom and dad had talked about it and she definitely wanted to be cremated, but when I was talking with her alone out of the blue she mentioned that she wanted to be cremated in her wedding dress - something she hadn't told my dad before.

We didn't have a full funeral for her because she didn't want one. So it was just our family at the funeral home. They dressed her in her wedding dress just like she asked and we had a private room with her where we all just cried and shared special memories we had with her. 

Be there for your dad - losing a parent is a lot different than losing your spouse and he will be grieving in a completely different way.

Good luck with everything, feel free to PM if you need someone to talk to or not talk to.",1
308,"My dad had a stroke a year or so ago, and thinking about his mortality, I bought this book called All About Me by Philipp Keel. I ask my dad the questions, and write the answers in the book.  I highly recommend it.  Hugs.",1
309,"Ask about family health history and your own health history as a child. This probably varies from family to family, but I do not know a lot about my own health history as a child and neither of my parents is a reliable narrator for various reasons. SO. MANY. TIMES. since my grandma and my cousin, who babysat me a lot, have passed away, I have wished I had asked them this stuff. I have, for example, a drug that I am apparently allergic to but I have no idea what happens if it is given to me. If I ask my mom, she just giggles and says she doesn't remember. My grandma and cousin could have told me. I'm guessing your mom is willing and able to answer these types of questions, so you may want to ask them now while you still can.",1
310,"If she'll let you, try to record her talking to you. Even if all it does is preserve less-than-stellar memories of her post-stroke and with cancer, it's something. I wish I have a video of my mom talking or laughing, even though by the end of her time with MS, she was nothing like the woman I knew when I was little.

I wish I had more childhood stories. I only have a few, and what little my dad can remember. To be honest, I don't know a whole lot about the person my mom was, because she got sick when I was very young, so she was always just ""Mom, sick"" to me. In a way, that's kind of nice, because I can tell myself she was perfect. If you don't want to kid yourself, find out what she believes, what she thinks about. Plans she had for you. How she felt or what she thought about the first time she held you. ",1
311,"Do you have children? Get a journal & ask for family recipes, or her favorite recipes.. how to get a stain out of carpet, advice for how to handle moody teenagers. Think of when you'd call her would it be for a dinner recipe or to ask what she would do in a situation? Write it all down. My grandfather passed away last month, he was like my father. Im so glad I knew it was coming & could ask him what his favorite songs were, his favorite movies. Food was our ""thing"" he took me to sushi before i was 2, when i was 7 we had our first thia food lunch date. Chinese was our regular, when he was in the hospital after a heart attack i actually had a chinese restaurant deliver to us in the hospital so he would eat something. Sorry! looks like I've gone on rambling. 
In addition to asking questions about her ask about parenting advice (if thats relevant) ask if theres something she wished she had done that you should definitely do. And write it all down!! ",1
312,"Ask her about her life. Her memories. Her parents, and grandparents, and the rest of her family. About the jobs she had, the places she went, her memories of your and your siblings that you might not know about. Ask her what you were like as a kid. Ask her what she loves and what makes her happy. Bring her those things where you can.

Ask her about her health history too - you will want to know about this.

Ask her about what she wants for her funeral, does she want to be an organ donor, does she want to be buried, where? Ask her what she wants done with her things. Make sure she updated her will. 

Help her record her memories. Write a book, record a story. Help her write a journal.

I'm sorry you have to go through this, and I'm touched by this question. My Dad had a stroke too.",1
313,"My mom passed away a year ago from cancer. She always told me about family and family history and everything about her side. I'm bad at remembering verbal stories and would give anything to have written everything down.

Ask your mom about your family history, about cousins and aunts and uncles. Anybody you need to remember to invite to a wedding for example. This also includes anything concerning illness, heart disease, cancer (if it is genetic for example).

In the same vein, if she has breast or ovarian cancer, ask if she could be tested for the BRCA mutation. Trust me, it'll take a load off your back if she comes out negative. If positive, you'll be more prepared in the future.

Ask about any valuables, antiques, heirlooms, jewelry that're important to her.

Ask about stories from your childhood, fond memories, things that'd make her smile.

Above all, just spend time with her and show your unconditional love for her. She needs it now more than ever. ",1
314,"I was in the exact same situation with my mom and here are some things that mean a lot to her and me:

- We did recordings of her singing the nursery rhymes and her favorite songs.  
- I made recording of her telling me about her childhood.  I hope to make these stories into a book one day.
- I have a recording of her singing happy birthday to me.
- She had me write personal letters to all my brothers and sisters with her memories of them when they were little and her hopes for them in the future.
- She taught me all the recipes she was known for.  We did this over a baby monitor I set up between her room and the kitchen.  I wrote everything down and practiced each dish with her telling me all the nuances.  This ended up being wonderful because it gave her purpose although she couldn't get out of bed.


Mainly, the things that meant the most during that time were making her feel needed and useful even though she couldn't get out the bed.  I let her call the shots and make the decisions as long as she could.  For example, I took pictures of her garden and let her tell me what to do.  She loved couponing, so I would help her clip and sort coupons.  She wanted to buy birthday gifts for the grandchildren so I went online shopping and ordered things she wanted to get and showed her the pictures.

I hope this is helpful to you.  The period right before my mom passed away were sad, but I got to know my mom on a level that I would not have been able to otherwise.",1

316,"My step-father passed away unexpectedly this winter.  When I was driving along in his truck one day about a month later, I noticed a recording device on his sunvisor.  
I pressed the button to see what jems he had recorded.
I damn near drove off the road when I heard him say ""Heya sweetheart, I still love you!"" (ostensibily to my Mom, but we all hear his love in that sentence).
I recorded it on my phone, emailed it around to the fam (to keep copies everywhere) and then waited for a good moment to play it for my Mom.
She now has a permanent recording of one of the sweetest sentences ever.

317,"I highly recommend this!!

Before my grandmother passed away, maybe 6 months before, I was able to record a short candid video of her telling an anecdote to my husband. Sometimes I watch it just to hear her voice and see her smile.

326,"That is a great thing to pick up and yes that sub is super supportive and helpful.  Start small.  Get yourself some good lines paper and just start with one stroke (down stroke is a great starting point).  Learn how to do one style of down stroke until you have it pretty well down.  This will help you learn  things like how much pressure to use, speed, and smoothness of movement as well as angle and size and all that stuff.  Then work on another stroke and add them together...  Once you have a few strokes down pretty well start learning an entire alphabet one letter at a time.  Just liek when you first learned to write.  You don't need any major investment to start.  Lined paper and even a remotely decent pen (of which there are recommendations on the sub) are all you need to start.  So don't worry about messing up a few ( even a few dozen) lines.

327,"I’m going to go with what my oldest said when meeting her baby sister (she was freshly 4 then). “Wow mommy, you make pretty babies.” It was funny and adorable, especially when she gave this big grin, knowing full well that she was included in that remark. I’ll take pride in that statement any day! 

And a second, much sadder but still sweet one. My best four legged friend of 11 years got ill very suddenly over the course of a week. By the time the vet got him in, my dog was in full kidney and liver failure. My daughter stayed right next to me all weekend, holding and stroking him, then hugging and stroking me too. He ended up passing away with him in my lap at home, my four year old leaning on my back to hug me. I was 8.5 months pregnant at the time, and I was just plain broken for weeks over it. Any time I’d start crying randomly, she’d stop what she was doing (even in other rooms), find me, hug me, and say different variations of “he loved you lots and you’ll see him again. we can have dreams of Strudel together!”.  She was incredibly understanding and strong during it, considering her age. She’s 5.5 now and still requests to hold the plaster of his paw print before bed sometimes so she “can dream of him”.

Their razors are super cheap and super good quality, and the cartridges last forever. I changed my last one in November and it's still sharp. No nicks. Their sales are insane too, especially around the holiday season. I bought enough razors and cartridges to last me a year for like $10 on there. 

That said: ankle to knee, rinse under running water, repeat. I rinse after every stroke.",1
334,"**Stroke:** Long strokes, Ankle to knee, and then knee to 1/3 up my thigh.

**Razor:** Gillette Venus

**Shave gel:** I just use soap lather usually, otherwise some conditioner.

**Rinse:** I just hold it under the shower stream every 3-4 strokes.

**Place:** I shave in the shower. Standing up for legs and pits and sitting down for minge.

**Nicks/cuts:** Rarely if ever.",1
335,"I use cheap disposable men's razors (currently Meijer brand, but I also really like Riteaid's) and that liquid Olay soap that has a bunch of lotion in it (it's seriously about the consistency of shaving lotion, has a really good, thick lather, and doesn't dry out my skin - and it's a big bottle for a couple bucks).  I sit on the side of the tub with the faucet at a drizzle to rinse the razor and a big jug of water to rinse my legs with (that I refill a couple times).  I use several short strokes, shaving ankle to mid thigh (I don't have much hair past there, though).  I rinse the blades every few strokes (or everybstroke if I haven't shaved in three months).  My legs usually take maybe 5 minutes each.",1
336,"I have really sensitive skin and find these things to be helpful! 

*If in a shower, make sure to let it get really steamy and soften the skin first. 

*If in a bath, then letting the area that I want to shave soak for a little while first to soften the skin. 

*Exfoliate first! I buy a jar of an exfoliating scrub to use on the skin I want to shave first to loosen the hair follicle and get rid of any dead skin. St. Ives Apricot Scrub is great. :) 

*Invest in a good shave cream/gel/lotion. I love the EOS brand shave lotion. It's excellent, lathers well and the Raspberry Pomegranate one smells so good. I've heard a lot of good things about Skintimate shave gel too, and I'm trying it out to see, but I love love love the EOS one! 

*Razor - nothing too fancy but definitely something that pivots and has conditioning strips and a couple of blades.

*Stroke from ankle to knee, and rinse after each stroke. ",1
337,"I shave in the shower. Shave days also usually coincide with co-wash days, so instead of shaving cream I use conditioner. Technique wise... I do long strokes on my ankle to knee until it looks mostly clean. Then knee up. Rinse. Then short strokes to clean up where ever i have missed",1
338,"I have extremely sensitive skin. This is the only ritual so far that has worked for me every time without giving me razor burn. I also can't shave more than twice per week or else razor burn is a sure thing.

**Shaving ritual -**

1. Set up your laptop on top of your toilet and take a warm bath while you watch an episode of your favorite TV show. Or just sit and relax for 20-45 minutes. Whichever is your bathtime preference.
2. Exfoliate your legs with some kind of scrub. I use LUSH's Ocean Salt, usually.
3. Get your razor clean and ready. I use the Venus sensitive skin razors.
4. Shave from ankle to knee using coconut oil as shaving cream. Rinse every two or three strokes, depending on how thickly you put the coconut oil. I run mine under the bathtub faucet every time but you can just slosh it around in the bathtub water if that doesn't gross you out.
5. If you shave your thighs, repeat this process but shave from your knees up. I don't usually exfoliate that part of my legs if I'm shaving because my skin is much more sensitive there.
6. Afterwards, I rub coconut oil on my legs in place of lotion.
7. I drain my bathtub, turn on my shower, and wash my body/hair like normal. Then I've got smooth legs *and* I'm clean!",1
339,"I shave in the bath. I blend up a cup of oatmeal in the blender and soak in it. Sometimes I'll exfoliate my legs with a sugar scrub. I use a Venus razor (the three blade one) and do long strokes, taking care to not press too hard. When I'm done I dip the razor in rubbing alcohol and don't store it in the bath. I soak in the bath for 10 more minutes. The oatmeal helps with moisture and irritation. ",1
340,"I shave in the shower. My ankle to my knee is 3-stroke high. I rinse my razor between each stroke, usually just under the shower head.

I find that rubbing coconut oil on my skin once my legs are dry is what makes everything smooth.",1
341,I use Dollar Shave Club razors. Started using coconut oil for shaving cream. Rinse every few strokes. Sometimes I use a cup for rinsing,1
342,"Are you talking about a dry shave? Use Venus brand razors. They wont destroy your legs. 

Since Venus has pretty good quality blades, I *barely* have to put any pressure on my skin when I shave with it. This decreases irritation. If your razor is *pulling* your hair before shaving it or cutting you easily, you have a bad blade. 

Razors that pull at hair have dull blades and need to be replaced. Razors that cut you easily have jagged blades which might be related to the quality of brand you have (or it might just be a factory fluke). 

In my experience it doesnt really matter if you do long or short strokes. You just have to do what it takes so that you are pressing the razor as lightly as possible on your skin, and is making contact with your skin as little as possible. 

I run the razor under the fauset or just tap it lightly inside the sink to remove the hair and wash it all down the drain when I am done.

Always follow up with something to moisterize your skin. Avoid scented lotions when you do this. They will irritate the skin. 

Of course when you have time to do it in the shower, do that. Its better for your skin since you can lather it up with soap first, which will be a barrier between the razor and your skin. If you shave in the shower there is no cleanup since the constantly running water takes care of that for you

343,"I shave in the shower and usually do my legs in three sections with long strokes. Ankle to below the knee, around the knee, above the knee to top of the thigh (mainly because if I'm not careful around my kneecaps I cut myself.)

I have read the paper published last year mentioning that patients likely already had arterial dissections starting before undergoing cervical manipulation.  If that is the case, then why take the risk of cervical manipulation prior to ruling out a dissection?  You can’t know that there is no dissection or vascular disease prior to cervical manipulation unless the patient has had vascular studies already done. The potential short term benefit from someone having their neck manipulated compared to the small risk of a catastrophic outcome in someone with an unknown underlying condition is something I think every patient should be informed of prior to consenting to cervical manipulation.  How many patients who had strokes do you think were told by their chiropractor prior to the maneuver that there is a risk of stroke if they do have a rare underlying arterial disease?  While the chance that they do have an underlying problem is small, I think it’s important for patients to be informed so they can decide for themselves if that is a risk they are willing to accept.

My body has also been in turmoil for the last year or so. I'm actually having surgery in a little over two weeks to see if I have endometriosis. My periods have just kept getting worse and worse, and I'm in pain for a week before it now, too, which absolutely sucks. They've been bad since I was 16, but in the last year they've got increasingly worse.

Nutrition! I don't know what this free online course will be like but it's free :) https://www.coursera.org/course/lifenutr

One of my fav fun facts: Your body uses cholesterol to make bile (among other things), bile helps you digest fats, once your digested food and bile enter your intestines your body can absorb and recycle the bile for future use - BUT - if you eat a lot of fiber it get's trapped in you stool and gets eliminated.

* Exercise: Does not kill you, does make you stronger. Do it. Even if it is just a short walk every day.

367,"> I only have my period once every 3 months and the only reason I do is to make sure I'm not pregnant.

It can take a while for your period to settle down after stopping the pill, so don't worry if it doesn't return to normal right away.  Also, the first bleed is likely the withdrawal bleed, your body doesn't know if you've stopped altogether or just for the week.  Additionally, being on the pill shouldn't affect the result of a pregnancy test, so it's fine to just do the old pee-on-the-stick.

The advice from RememberYourPass refers to the combined pill, the mini-pill (progesterone only pill) is taken every day without breaks, and your period can remain normal, stop altogether, or anything in between.  Other methods can have different effects.

All things considered though, what every woman should know about contraception is: don't be afraid to ask your doctor (or whoever is prescribing) as many questions as you want about your contraceptive choices, including side effects, efficacy, method of action, effect on your period, and anything else that pops into your head.  There are no stupid questions.  The combined pill is most common, but far from the only option.  If you're not happy, go back and discuss it again.  If you don't think your doctor is listening to you, see somebody else.  Don't go without birth control just because the first method you tried didn't work out for you.",1

369,"Oof, I swam all thru high school and still go swim laps occasionally at the gym since. 

 The chlorine can be rough. If you are swimming every day or even several days a week, I would suggest getting a kick board and just doing kick laps every few days to give your hair a break from the chlorine. 

A little bit of spit in the goggles rubbed around with a quick rinse will keep them from getting foggy. 

Be sure to rinse your swim suit out in the shower/sink after *every* use to make it last longer. Absolutely don't leave it out in the sun to dry unless you want the spandex to die and the color to fade. 

Rinse your body off too, every time & MOISTURIZE. If you start swimming a lot, don't be surprised if you start to sweat chlorine :P 

Look up some workouts online, print them off and laminate them  and bring them to the pool with you to keep you on track. A one hour workout will go SO much faster and be so much more fun if it is made up of 6 ten-minute workouts rather than a straight 60 minutes swimming freestyle back and forth. Set goals and push yourself. 

Focus on technique, not speed. Once you've got the technique down, you'll notice that the speed will come naturally. But if you don't figure out how to do the strokes properly, you'll more than likely end up tiring yourself out quickly and not really going anywhere. I kind of see it like using an elliptical. Yeah, you can step on and start going full power with the machine off or on the easiest resistance, but....are you really accomplishing anything? 

I've always thought that backstroke is a great stroke for when you need a little break, because you don't need to time your breaths with your strokes. Learn how many strokes it takes you to get from the flags to the wall so you don't have to keep doing that awkward head-lean-back-thing to make sure you aren't about to hit concrete. ",1
370,"Wet your hair and body down **fully** before you enter the pool area. Invest in some swimmer's shampoo and conditioner, like the UltraSwim chlorine removal line (from target), that's what I use.

Caps suck imo, so I typically braid my long blonde hair and make sure its wet AF before I get in and that I wash and condition it properly on the way out. Haven't gone green yet and I've been swimming for workouts for the last few years. 

Make sure in addition to proper hair care, that you moisturize your body thoroughly because chlorine will dry your skin out in a major way.

Break up your strokes and your routine (sometimes I'll do 10 laps freestyle, then 5 more of backstroke as a 'break', then 10 more freestyle etc etc) and BRING A WATER BOTTLE WITH YOU TO THE POOL. People totally forget that you need to replenish your fluids when you're working out hard in a pool ... cause well, it's wet.

Swimming totally rocks. The best part for me is zenning out to the sounds of the water. And I have to focus on breathing and not drowning so it prevents any other random thoughts from going thru my head. Nothing like an hour and a half of pure me-time.

371,"I have bleached hair AND ""fun colours"" so I'm very paranoid about my hair getting messed up by the chlorine.  I wet and braid my hair tightly (french braid pigtails) before I leave the house and pop it all under a silicone cap.  I'm saving up for a better swimsuit as the one I have now, while it's a one-piece, isn't ideal for lap swimming as it's got underwire support.  I'm going to buy something a little more full-coverage soon.  

I go with my partner so it's a little less boring, and we stop and chat/defog our goggles every few laps.  It's a really small 5-lane community pool and there are usually only 2 other people there so we aren't taking up lanes from other people by doing this, but obviously in a bigger/busier pool we'd be a little more focused on the exercise. 

I switch between front crawl and backstroke mostly, and I might switch to occasionally using a kickboard so I can focus more on my legs.  We've only been going for about a month and once it warms up, I think we'll also add a walk/jog to and from the pool with our gear in a backpack, since it's only about 10 minutes away.",1

Next issue I see people have no roll or glide; their arms come in too soon from this poor form. Your arms should be stretching out almost on your side. (Which is then easier to breath to your side)

I need to establish myself as his parent, someone to respect and listen to but also who loves him and will protect him no matter what. My dad was very good at that and my mom excels at loving and protecting, but was somewhat less consistent with standing firm.

387,"Trust me , go for at it 2 times a day for weeks, and you are going to get a pinky one.

Recently since I pretty much just realized am jacking off every other day 2 times at it, I decided to try and count the strokes it takes till the first feeling of cuming , and try different strokes and rithm. That was enhanced with a few bowls while taking a hot bath.

Now I decided to not use any porn for visuary images and just do it without it. This was also an attempt at just reducing my porn, but at the same time just leaving my masturbation alone, but enhance the skills I could learn, and endurance I can endure while learning my limits.

So basically what I had in mind was practicing trying to hold it as much as I could, first by stopping stroking it , then by keeping stroking while counting the strokes.

For the first week it was hard to hold it in, even though I ve been jacking earlier, I never tried to hold it off much or actually count it. So it was hard. After 2-4 weeks I started noticing that I was like improving, like what I found out that helped was. That I started viewing how applying a rithm consisting with a wide array of strokes and at different pace, I could actually build up the load bigger.

In other words, prolonging the shoot up. I discovered instead of going at the same pace and like do it faster, I could actually change my pace to keeping from shooting up.

The only thing I can say though is that, you really need to put a lot of focus on it, and no distractions and concentrate on a sexual image. At the same time I have a bucket that I use to pour the hot water from the bath and slowly drip it over my penis while am stroking with the other one. I found that little trick gets the engine going,like it responds to the warm water instantly and stretches my muscles, almost to the same extent as  how a cat does when he is pouring. 

Its not bad, I mean I can feel that am increasing much . However, I noticed much more of the improvement on the 4-6 weeks, after doing this for about like 16-20 I really don't see as much of an improvement per week as the first ones. Now funny enough, am actually trying to do a different tracking.

Since I can pretty much hold my load longer, from having exercise my pc muscles from those kegel exercises, I am actually intrigue in finding the distance of how far I can shoot my load. I figured, that if am not going to be in a relationship now, it would be better to improve on my skills on masturbation and get rid of the porn and just using my imagination.

So far though, it has been great. It was hard at first, but it has the greatest degree of satisfaction comparing to just watching porn and releasing my load.

After releasing it , while at the same time being high in a hot bath, I feel the greatest rush going through my body with great relief. The only downside is that, my dick start to hurts sometimes, because sometimes I can go on and do it 3 times, in a session. Seems weird but I can stay in a bath for 3-4 hours just taking break, and relaxing, first hour to hour and half I do from 1 to 3 sessions and the rest I just sit there relaxing in a profound way checking my problems and dropping them of my list by analyzing them with a more positive state of mind.

I felt a little silly but better safe than sorry.",1
415,"That seems like a very easy lie to uncover (assuming you know your measurements and the average size of a penis), so it doesn't make sense to say unless it's true.  I certainly haven't.

There are plenty of ways to compliment a not-big dick without lying about its size.  I use those ego strokes more liberally.",1
416,"I've only ever told one guy I was with that his penis was huge, and it was because it actually hurts me. 

Others I did tell they were a good size, when they were. I've never told someone they were big to stroke his ego. I've always been honest. ",1
417,"For me, no. I've only said it when it's certainly true, and I'm very well aware of averages and so forth. In fact, I've only said it once, to my now ex-husband. I don't feel the need to falsely ""stroke a man's ego"" on penis size, since I don't believe penis size should be an ego-thing. There's a lot of things I love about a partner's penis, if it's not notably large I'm not going to tell him it isn't, and he'd know I was lying anyway so why bother?",1
418,"I am sure other people will have some better tips but here's what has worked for me. 

You don't necessarily have to deep throat. You can use your hand in conjunction with your mouth, stroking up and down with it as you take the head in your mouth as far as you want to go. Let it be very wet --  drool a bit so your hand moves smoothly and wetly along with your mouth. You want it to seem like they are kind of one unit. Watch your teeth. Use your tongue to stimulate the frenulum (the knotty looking part on the underside of the penis) and gently squeeze and stroke the shaft with your hand. Using the other hand, stroke the balls or the perineum, or whatever your guy responds to more. 

Beyond this, it's really a good idea for you to solicit some direction from your man in terms of what he really wants from you. He's going to have particular sensitive parts that only he can really tell you about. 

Make sure you are enthusiastic, most of all, about learning how he works and doing it in general. Look up at him sometimes if you take a break to just lick the thing and tease him. Smile and make sounds. Admire him. Enjoy the experience. ",1
419,"I have a HORRIBLE gag reflex. I thought I wouldn't be able to give good head ever, but now every man who I give head has told me that I give INCREDIBLE blowjobs. I do pride myself in it.

My biggest tip: USE YOUR HANDS. You do not have to deep throat. Put your hand around the base and then stroke as you move your head up and down his shaft. Also make sure to get it really wet. I'm not joking when I say slobber all over that cock (just try not to make it look like you're a drooling dog). 

You'll get the hang of it over time. I've been giving head since age 16 and I don't think I really got good until this last year (21). It takes time and practice. You'll learn best from experience.",1
420,"There's a great new alternative for younger women who want an IUD called Skyla. Check it out!

You should tell your mom that the risk of stroke is so statistically low that it's almost irrelevant. Unless you smoke, have a blood disorder, or are over forty, it's not something to worry about.

Furthermore, you should remind your mom (if you think you can do this without putting yourself in emotional or physical danger because of her judging you or something) that, as a maturing girl, you're going to be doing things that could put you at risk for way worse consequences than a broken heart, which is probably her biggest concern with you having sex.

I'd recommend one of two ways to approach the topic:

1. Going out to shop or do something else which doesn't require being side-by-side or face-to-face. That way, the embarrassment factor is lower, and she doesn't have the opportunity to overreact. Another good option is to go to dinner so that you can have something to do if there are any awkward pauses or have an excuse if you need time to prepare a response to one of her questions.

2. Let her broach a similar topic (no later than, like, a week from now, though -- it's imperative you get protected soon!) and derail the conversation into birth control. If she talks about you having a boyfriend, mention that you're considering being with someone and want to be safe just in case. If she talks about a doctor's visit, ask whether she has the time to help pick out a gyno or visit Planned Parenthood to see about birth control.

Tips:

* Don't waver. If you're confident and strong going into the conversation, she'll be less likely to try to string you out until you submit to her decision.

* Do a little bit of research. Are your PMS symptoms irrationally bad? That probably rules out most long-term ones, like the shot or the IUD, because they're progesterin only and that's the hormone that makes you feel gross, bloated, and angry before your period. (This is a gross oversimplification of a very complex topic.)

* When researching, try to find your top three choices. This could be generics (the shot, the pill, the implant) or specific (Skyla, Implanon, Depo Provera). That way, she can't shoot you down entirely if she wants to insist on a different option, and you look like you know your stuff.

* Try to get a handle on the insurance equation. Do you have private insurance, and if so, do they have an exemption from covering it? Will you have a co-pay? Do you qualify for free birth control from your state? Your mom will have a harder time ignoring you if you have specific info.

* Come into the conversation with a specific provider in mind. Do you want to go through your GP, gynecologist, or Planned Parenthood? Would it be easier to pick it up from a PP clinic or a pharmacy? Do you want a discreet option like the shot so no one knows you're on it, and if so, does your doctor provide it?

A few last notes:

I'm a little confused by your statement that you're not sure if you're comfortable with the insertion process. Is that because you don't want people near your vagina? I like to point out that if you're sexually active, someone else has very private access to you, so you most likely shouldn't be self-conscious! It's not like a doctor is going to judge you.

Make sure to use condoms! They're for more than pregnancy prevention, it's about safety in more ways than you know. Since you're young, you're at a higher risk for STIs and haven't learned all the secrets of your body, so you could turn out to be allergic to something like lubricant, and the reaction could cause easier transmission. (I always recommend getting tested every six months, just because it's possible to contract one and not know it, then pass it on unaware!) Everyone's body is susceptible to certain things -- colds, the flu, cancer, bronchitis, you name it and millions of people have it -- and STIs are no different.

Finally, I'd recommend taking at look at plannedparenthood.org and using their My Method test to find one that'll suit you. bedsider.org is another of my favorites and they have comparison options and a way to view all of them in a chart which displays their different qualities, like the ability to be spontaneous, the discreetness, and the reliability.

Oh, and I wanted to mention: 99% of the stories you hear about birth control are unreliable because of their statistical insignificance. Studies have shown that the average weight gain due to BC is five pounds and the rest is usually a result of comfort levels rising or other situational circumstances. The myth of the IUD dislodging is widespread but very statistically insignificant -- we're talking a few hundred to a few thousand people out of sheer millions. Make sure to do thorough research if your mom tries to bring these points up -- again, plannedparenthood.org is a good resource, and although it's tricky to navigate, guttmacher.org has some good studies on this stuff, too!

(For younger women, I usually recommend Skyla, which provides three years of coverage, or one of the dozens of pills if they're looking for the most potent anti-acne and period-reducing side effects. A lot of women are uncomfortable with the ring because they don't like to get intimate with themselves like that, but it's a very reliable method, and you should be comfortable with it if you're having sex!)",1
421,"Have you shown her the statistics proving that the risk of stroke is low? (Especially for a nonsmoker).  Does she know that you are sexually active now? If she does, you should stress the importance of preventing pregnancy. If she doesn't, you might want to tell her so that she doesn't blow you off because she's not worried about you getting pregnant. I'd also say that while acne reduction and shorter periods are great, your priority should really be on keeping yourself safe from unwanted pregnancy now. Also, IUDs aren't typically in women your age because many doctors refused to prescribe them for young women, but studies have shown that they're safe and extremely effective for teens. It's a lot better to go with something more effective, better safe than sorry. I personally have been on the Nuva Ring for 8 years and have never had an issue. If you aren't sure that you'll be able to take a pill at the same time every day, you might want to look into other forms.",1
422,"I'm been on the pill since I was 16, so about 7 years now, and the only issues I've ever had is the occasional breakthrough bleeding.  Strokes risk increases with age and smoking, but really you should be fine.  Honestly, my mom was a little upset that I was having sex at that age, but also didn't want me getting pregnant.  

I had problems with breakthrough bleeding and I've found that ortho-cyclen works best for preventing that.  ",1
423,"implanon doesn't have the stroke risk, very reliable and easy to use (put it in, works for 3 years). That said, unless you need your mum for money/taking you to the doctor ect, you should just talk to the doctor",1
424,"Do you have any family history of blood clots or stroke?  If so, your mother's concerns are far from unreasonable.  I know being young helps make it seem unlikely, but it does happen, and even if it doesn't have lifelong consequences, treatment makes IUD insertion seem like a breeze.  

Depending on your financial situation, you and your mother may be able to reach a compromise where you get tested for clotting conditions before going on the pill.  They aren't cheap tests, and you would need to talk to your doctor and get a blood draw, but knowing you're not part of a high-risk group could put you both at ease.  

Honestly, though, I'd recommend going to a gyno, and discussing your options with the gynecologist and your mother.  A doctor will know what's worked for patients in her practice, as well as being up to date on products and research.  Keep an open mind, and worry more about what'll work for you than what you think is ""normal"" for people your age.  ",1

431,"Doing things together: don't be wishy-washy all the time, but you're only human. You aren't an entertainment factory. It's equally frustrating for anyone, male or female, to dance the ""I don't know, what do you wanna do?"" dance.

Shopping together: do people seriously, early in relationships, get asked shit like, ""Will you buy this for me?"" How rude. It's hard for me to address this because it's so far beyond the behaviour I'd consider appropriate earlier in a relationship. Once you've been together for a longer time, suggesting an item you might like for a present is cool but if a lady is gonna do that you should be able to do that too. That said, joking about your mistress liking it seems like such a douchey, PUA way to handle this.

Making it rain: it really depends on the lady. I think the best gift is tailored to an individual. Some people like experiences, others like items they can use for experiences, some like beautiful items they can admire and attach memories to. This advice is too generic. Personally, I quite like items I can keep that become sentimentally tied to a partner, but my favourite gift my SO has ever given me was a relatively inexpensive pack of drawing pens that happened to combine two of my favourite drawing styles in a way that most pens can't handle. It was the sheer attentiveness to my artistic style that melted my heart about this gift, because I'd never encountered anything like these pens before but they were just perfect for the kind of art I do, and that's specifically why he got them.

The crying game: I really rather like being asked what's going on. Sometimes it helps to talk while sobbing. If I just want to cry it out, I'll say so, but hell, I'm pretty good at articulating my emotional needs, and I know that isn't true of everyone. When enough time has passed, sometimes it can be nice to try to tell a joke to help me escape the sadness, but at first just letting me feel my feelings is pretty good.

Compliments and flattery: nah. I mean, don't talk about her like she's a goddess built from gold and cheat codes, but once you're in a secure and loving relationship, compliments can flow pretty freely and happily, and it's a beautiful thing. They just shouldn't dominate your conversations, because shit, that becomes more like worship than connection.

Advice: this is bullshit. However, take into account that a lady is a person with a brain just like you, and is capable of solving her own problems. If you find yourself in that age-old ""she wants to vent but I wanna give her advice about her problems"" conundrum, there's a simple solution - ask her if she'd like advice, commiseration or distraction. Everyone appreciates having their preferences taken into account!

Conversational fluff: if your SO bores you, don't date her. If you don't feel capable of talking with her, hey, you could be a relatively quiet person, but that level of talking differential sounds more like you aren't really interested in having conversations with her at all. It certainly doesn't sound like a fun ratio to me, or a ratio that my male SO would enjoy much. I think he'd feel pretty erased if he got to talk that little.

Massage can help with shortened and tightened muscles.

Neck and Chest muscles (SCM, Scalenes, Pecs) are often shortened due to poor posture caused by ""desk work"" (As a PC gamer, mine are too) 

These often cause your back muscles to stretch and overextert themselves, (That chronic neck and trap pain everyone has) 

What you can do to help the muscles relax is scrub the attachment points of the muscles as it stimulates the Golgi Tendon Organ which sends signals for the muscles to release, as well as releasing endorphins. (If you ever had a good massage and felt a good ""woozy"" after, or during certain bedroom activities, it's probably the endorphins) 

You can do this yourself at home, but it would be best to go to a professional first.

If you do want to try it out, run your fingers right under your collarbone. You'll may feel some tiny bumps or tenderness, and slowly massage them away (Heat is much better than pressure, so focus on warming up the area to smooth it out than brute strength.) Your pecs also attach to the sternum, so see if you can palpate anything there.

The Sternocleidomastoid is another major culprit for chest pain, since it attaches to both the clavicle and sternum. 

[Picture here](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/189659/file-28977451-png/images/sternocleidomastoid-attachments.png?t=1467831757830&width=310&height=387) 

[And another here](http://pocketdentistry.com/wp-content/uploads/285/F000047f004-001-9781437724196.jpg)

If this is shortened, it can pull your rib cage a bit out of whack. It would be on the top side of the collarbone, the top lateral (outward) edges of the sternum and the Mastoid process which is behind the ear. Though massaging this muscle can mess with the support your head has, it be best to have a professional do it while you're lying down. But once you have an idea where those muscles are attached and the procedure, I would kinda say try it for yourself. But again, I'm kinda going to school for it, so for me it's more self/preventive care rather then corrective.",1
440,Had to do that last night at the doctors and nearly passed out! ,1
441,"Not me, but I'm a nurse who works frequently with heart attack patients (for simplicity, I'm calling them heart attacks, when I mean ""myocardial infarctions"" - a blockage in one or more coronary arteries, causing heart muscle damage due to a lack of oxygen supplied by blood). The symptoms range from the very typical to really odd ones. I'd say the most common symptoms are pretty typical - a lot of chest pain (usually described as a ""heaviness"" like an elephant on the chest or a ""crushing"" or ""squeezing"", but people can have all sorts of different pains), often accompanied with symptoms like shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, and/or just generally feeling unwell and that something ""just isn't right"". Sometimes, the pain radiates to the jaw, the left arm, and/or the back, but I actually find it's less common than simply chest pain.

The most common vague symptom is definitely heartburn. Heartburn can mimic heart attacks and vice versa. I've seen people who thought they were having heartburn for days on end, when actually, they were having a heart attack (because it's not like on TV, where people suddenly clutch at their chests and keel over; such cases are usually the people who go into arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, which *can* be caused by heart attacks but not always). Usually, the key difference is the presence of other symptoms described above, but as I said, they're not always present. This is one of the reasons why it's important to get heartburn checked out if it doesn't respond to over-the-counter medications (the other side to it is that heartburn can actually do damage to your esophagus over time, so it's best to nip that in the bud in its early stages).

Lastly, I hope I don't scare anyone here, but there is also such a thing as ""silent heart attacks"", where a person is having a heart attack but there aren't any symptoms. It's more common in those with diabetes and the elderly. I once had a patient who was in hospital for a gangrenous toe (don't get diabetes, folks), and one morning, he was awake early and reading the newspaper, so I did a set of vital signs on him. To my surprise, his pulse was in the 140's (for reference, normal rate is 60-100, though we start to get worried around the 110-120 range). Called the doctor, who ordered some tests. The patient was totally calm, no pain or breathing difficulties (except for his sore toe). Turns out he was having a heart attack! He was treated for it and did fine, but sometimes I wonder what would have happened if he were sitting at home rather than in the hospital.

(**EDIT:** I am getting a few questions about the heart rate thing. I should add that heart rate alone is *not* an indicator of anything. It has to be taken in context. *Lots* of things can cause a high heart rate, from benign causes like anxiety or too much caffeine to more concerning things like a serious heart condition. One must take into consideration things like other vital signs, signs and symptoms, the patient's history, etc., to get even a decent clinical picture of what's going on. If a high heart rate can be explained, then it's not as big of a deal, either. For example, if a person is in respiratory distress, then they will have a heart rate because, well, they're struggling to breathe. As soon as you fix the respiratory issues, the heart rate should come down nicely. Also, the 110-120 range is still referring to a *resting* heart rate, and don't forget that I work in a hospital, often with patients who have co-morbidities that affect the heart's health and/or are elderly, who typically have lots of co-morbidities anyway. A young, healthy person may be able to tolerate a resting heart rate in the 110-120 range if, say, they get sick. An elderly person who has diabetes and heart disease? Yeah, not so much. A person who has just had a heart attack? Same. Their hearts just aren't able to work as hard as a young, healthy person's for prolonged periods of time. If you're young, healthy, and not sick or anxious or anything like that and your *resting* heart rate is elevated, then I wouldn't say it's a cause to panic, but you may want to get checked out by your family doctor - could be anything from anxiety to a malfunctioning thyroid to an actual problem with your heart. Again, go with your gut. If something feels *wrong* to you and you're that concerned about it, then talk to a doctor. I can't diagnose anything over the Internet...plus, I'm a nurse so I don't diagnose things in general!)

On the flip side, you can also have all the symptoms of a heart attack and even had things like electrocardiogram changes that suggest a heart attack, but in actuality, your coronary arteries don't have any blockages! (i.e. not a heart attack) An example would be [Takotsubo cardiomyopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takotsubo_cardiomyopathy) (a.k.a. Broken Heart Syndrome). I've looked after two patients with this diagnosis and it's really bizarre. Basically, the heart muscle will be injured, often due to stress (hence the name Broken Heart Syndrome - it's been known to happen after a person has lost a loved one), so we'll often see changes in the ECG, troponin level rise in the blood (often used to determine severity of a heart attack), and even indicators of heart failure. However, when an angiogram is done, there aren't any coronary artery blockages. The good news is that people generally do well after this, so long as they take care of themselves.

So basically, the heart is a very complicated organ and there is no real way to tell if there's something seriously wrong with it or not based on symptoms alone. As well, pain in the chest can be caused by so many different things, from anxiety to costocondritis to pulmonary emboli to heart attacks. Basically, if you have a concern about it, go see a doctor. Go with your gut and don't ignore symptoms that won't go away.

**LAST EDIT:** I'm getting lots of people asking me about their specific situations. As per Reddit policy (and because it's uncomfortable for me), I won't be giving medical advice to *anyone*. I can't evaluate anyone over the Internet. I'd merely be taking wild guesses, which isn't safe. If you have an actual concern about your health, please see a professional in real life, who can discuss things with you and do an examination.",1
442,"EMT here. I once treated a woman who was exhibiting all the classic signs of an anxiety attack, but we decided to do an EKG just in case because she was also feeling gassy. I'm glad we didn't just write her off as she requested because she was in a full-blown STEMI! Another time a family friend called me because she was just feeling a sense of doom and heaviness, like an elephant was sitting on her. I told her to call an ambulance just in case, and sure enough, it was a heart attack.

443,"This is an awesome question! Women have definitely been seen to have much different symptoms from men and it's so important to know about how cardiac episodes can present themselves for women vs. men.  Heart disease might not be the most popular or talked about cause, but heart disease and strokes are the cause of death of one out of every three women. 

I've been involved with the American Heart Association for years and they have a TON of resources but below are some pointers. Overall, all the survivors I've heard speak over the years typically say they experienced headaches and ""heaviness,"" but not the traditional arm tingling and crushing chest pain. It was much more subtle. 

Lastly, one of the big things we always try to hit home is it is so often that women are the last to raise their hand and recognize something is really wrong with them. We put others in front of us and think that it will just pass. One women told me she went the whole day, getting her sons to school, cooking dinner for her family, while she was suffering from a severe cardiac episode. She just didn't think it was serious enough to bother anyone with until she collapsed.

- Uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain in the center of your chest. It lasts more than a few minutes, or goes away and comes back.

- Pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach.

- Shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort.

- Other signs such as breaking out in cold sweat, nausea or lightheadedness.

- Women are somewhat more likely than men to experience some of the other common symptoms, particular shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting and back or jaw pain.

**Signs of Stroke and TIAs (transient ischemic attack)**

- Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body.

- Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding.

- Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes.

- Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination.- Sudden severe headache with no known cause.",1

She had originally gone to the dentist to investigate her symptoms - luckily the dentist was insightful and got her to a cardiologist. We found extremely lesioned arteries in the Cath lab; she was a walking time bomb for a heart attack.,1
447,"My mother had an heart attack and her only symptom was excruciating ear pain. Kid you not! Was lying on the floor, whimpering in a mix of her mother tongue and German, clutching her ears. Called our 911 equivalent, the dispatcher tried to tell me it was probably just a bad cold, buuuut if I insisted he would send somebody over. Asshole. It's 3 in the night, I wouldn't call if it didn't look really serious. ",1
448,"OK I am not a woman but I did have a heart attack and the symptoms were very mild.

I was already being treated for angina, high blood pressure and diabetes.

My cardiologist told me ""you know all the classic symptoms, but there are others. So if anything at all unusual starts happening? Get thee to a hospital.""

What was unusual? I was working late shift and so I got up at around 10 AM. Yawned, walked slowly to the front door and picked up the paper. Took it into the kitchen to sit, drink coffee and read the paper. I was out of breath from that tiny amount of exercise. I rested several minutes until my breathing was normal and walked slowly to the front door (16 feet) and back. Arrived out of breath. Called a cab. No drama. Take me  to emerg please. 

Checked in at the reception saying I thought I was having  a heart attack and my cardiologist said I should come here. 

They took me seriously and did some basic monitoring.They would not let me leave until they did 'something about it.'  

I left the hospital after having a quintuple bypass a couple weeks later.",1
449,"My late father went to his doctor to complain about heartburn.  One test led to another.  Both his carotid and pulmonary arteries were almost completely blocked.  Right at that appointment the doctor got him an appointment for bypass surgery in a week.   I learned in the hospital that he had earlier had a ""silent heart attack"".

A very fit friend of mine in her 30s who ate a vegan diet went to a health fair that had some sort of portable scanner that revealed her carotid artery had a LOT of plaque buildup on it.

Turns out she is one of those people with genetics that despite a great lifestyle, still needed statins.

Bottom line, have regular checkups with a thorough doctor.   You just don't know what could be going on inside of you.",1
450,"Ex-boyfriend had two heart attacks in his 20's,  physically fit with no family history of heart disease.  He smoked and drank and certainly didn't eat the healthiest, but also played soccer several times a week and was in pretty decent shape.

He had heartburn, chest pain, vomiting, cold sweats, shortness of breath and was very pale.  I honestly thought it was heat stroke, it was very hot that day and he had just played soccer maybe an hour earlier, but I suppose he sensed it was something worse and so I drove him to the ER.   They did the ecg and took him back almost immediately, it was a 100% blockage of his right coronary artery and he had an angioplasty and stent put in.   Huge life change for him that he had a really hard time accepting and adjusting to - sort of caused the second heart attack himself, by not being diligent with his meds and we knew right away to call an ambulance that time.",1
451,"My mother had throbbing jaw discomfort for months before she experienced full cardiac arrest.  She brought this up with her dentist and GP, but neither could find anything wrong.  About a month and a half before the heart attack, she had an EKG done to make sure she was clear to go on this big trip that she and my dad planned for overseas, and it showed no abnormalities.  She had also lost ~60 lbs over the previous 18 months in preparation for this trip, which involved a whole lot of walking.

The day or two before the heart attack, she experienced higher-than-usual fatigue and some heartburn (I think?), but nothing that was out of the ordinary for her, especially with the  leukemia drugs that she takes.  Then, at about 11:30 on a Tuesday night four years ago, she just dropped clinically dead on the kitchen floor with a full blockage of one of her arteries.

I was able to intervene almost immediately with CPR until the EMTs arrived and (eventually) successfully defibrilated her.  We've been very lucky that she's made a very substantial recovery.  While she has considerably diminished cardiac capacity, she did not suffer any other major organ damage and, while somewhat frail, she's a fully-functioning 55-year-old.",1
452,"Sorry this is long.

That last bit--Broken Heart Syndrome--I had something similar but no broken heart.  10 years ago, I was in law school, my dad died, and I was becoming hypothyroid (undiagnosed another years).  So *everything* was stressing, and my bp was good if it was under 145/100.  This was for over a year.

Having chest pains, I was sent to a cardiologist.  He asked me to describe my pain; I described six distinct types of pains: weight on chest, like a tight band; pain under the sternum; pain up to my jaw; sharp pains (like nails being pounded in) just left of center on my chest; dull aches that had me grabbing at my chest; and the worst one--lasting pain like someone shoved a pipe through my chest and it was coming out my back.  Oh, and though it's just an indicator of inflammation *somewhere*, a CRP over 20.  I'd had years of heartburn; an endoscopy showed NO esophageal issues.

The cardiologist's mouth literally dropped open on that last bit, husband said it was because that was ""classic heart attack"" and I said I'd felt it 8 or 9 times.  EKG was clear--they've always been just fine since, too.  First stress test was ""inconclusive.""  Two years later, the second one was, too.  I also had a massive x-ray, had to go to San Francisco for that--no *major* problem found, calcification somewhere between 0 and 50%, so not really helpful.  Oh, and an ultrasound, and some other test I can't remember.  All that was found found was that my heart was a bit larger than expected, but not unduly so, and no thickening of the walls.  I was told that I could ""buy green bananas""--I'd be alive to eat them when ripe, if you didn't figure that out.

Finished law school, got thyroid dosage right (that took a couple of years), and with that find, I passed the Bar the second time.  Stress down, as I was not working.  When I had pain suddenly, I insisted on an angiogram, based on that pain, my history, and family history (father had blockage but his body had made its own diversions around it).  

I had NO significant blockage of ANY kind.  At age 50, my arteries weren't perfect, but we're about as good as a 25yo.  NO damage to my heart muscle.  CRP still won't come down.  

**tl;dr**:  So not all chest pain means a heart attack, but it pays to be cautious, right?",1
453,">Lastly, I hope I don't scare anyone here, but there is also such a thing as ""silent heart attacks"", where a person is having a heart attack but there aren't any symptoms. It's more common in those with diabetes and the elderly. 

I'd also note they are more common in women over 40 then men. I can find a source if desired. ",1
454,"I'm in my early 30s, heart disease runs in my family. I went to the ER a few weekends ago with chest pains thinking it was severe heartburn. Turns out it was angina(?). The symptoms I had were chest pains like someone was pressing heavily in the center of my chest and slight shortness of breath. They did chest xrays, CT scan  and EKG. Everything came back fine. What did show up to be abnormal were my triponin levels. After being discharged from the hospital the next day, I scheduled a stress test, which came back normal, and then an echocardiogram which also came back normal. The doctor said this was an anomaly, but put me on an Aspirin regimen and I have to get yearly checkups due to my family history. The doctor said I may not exhibit symptoms for days, months or years from now but also to have my blood pressure checked regularly. Moral of the story; Don't ignore chest pains, people.",1
455,"So once your pulse is around 140 bpm, you should be concerned it's a heart attack?  

My heart rate sometimes spikes for 2-30 minutes and I get lightheaded.  I was referred to a cardiologist for basic tests (a heart monitor), where they confirmed my heart rate spikes, usually to 115-125 bpm.  They sent me back to my GP who shrugged about it and said to come back another time, and go to the ER if it gets worse.

No one will tell me what 'worse' actually means, though.  I have absolutely no idea what warrants a trip to the ER.  Since you mentioned 140bpm, is that around the time I should consider going to the ER?  I know you can't really give me medical advice based off of a random reddit comment, but if I could get some not completely vague guidelines for when I should be concerned, that would be *amazing*.

So, yeah, it's always worth getting it checked out :) No one will laugh at you or think any less of you.",1
459,"Heart rate alone isn't really an indicator of anything in particular. Lots of people with heart attacks come in with heart rates within normal range. On the other hand, you can have people having anxiety attacks (scary for the person, of course, but not life threatening) with very high heart rates. So, yeah, heart rate has to be taken within context and in conjunction with many other things, like other vital signs, the patient's presentation, and other signs and symptoms (and, of course, other diagnostic tests if needed, like blood work or ECGs).",1
460,"No not necessarily. A high heart rate could be a result of many things. If it's not accompanied by chest pain or any other symptom of a heart attack, I'd think of other possibilities first. Also (almost - 2 months away) a nurse. 
If you have a high heart rate, start to get dizzy, short of breath, feel it pounding in your chest or fluttering, have chest, jaw, back or arm pain - that's when you should go to the ER. 

I personally have inappropriate sinus tachycardia, which basically means my heart rate is around 120 when I'm at rest. It's totally benign for me. ",1
461,"I should really put a note on that...

110-120 is in context, and I meant that as a *resting* heart rate. Heart rate alone *does not mean anything* and other things - like other vital signs, signs and symptoms, history, etc. - must be taken into consideration to interpret what a heart rate means in a clinical sense.

Your resting heart rate is about 80, which falls within normal range. Remember, I work in a hospital with ill patients, usually an older population (i.e. age 60+), and most patients I see aren't typically the healthiest of people (i.e. typically have at least one co-morbidity, such as smoking, diabetes, COPD, cardiac disease of some sort, etc.). Where I work specifically - cardiology - if the heart has already sustained damage because of, say, a heart attack, then we do try to keep the resting heart rate below 90. Anything higher means the heart must work harder, which is like making an injured person run a race.

If you're young, otherwise healthy, and have no symptoms, it's likely not too worrying. I've had young patients come in for things like infections or uncontrolled blood sugars (type 1 diabetics), and the doctors are fine with them having heart rates in the 120's because they're young and can compensate for that fast a rate (and there's an obvious explanation for it). A person in their 80's who has multiple co-morbidities? Yeah, their bodies just aren't as capable of compensating for as long.

Obviously, I can't diagnose anything over the Internet, but if your heart is beating fast with just ""any movement"" and you have no symptoms but is normal at rest, I'd hazard a guess that you may want to work on your cardio exercises if you aren't already? If you're physically fit, though, then I honestly have no idea and someone would have to actually evaluate you in person.",1
462,"I am a substitute teacher, so my days follow similar patterns, but aren't ever quite the same. I'm in several districts so my day starts anywhere from 7:05 to 8:50 am. I try to get to school fifteen to twenty minutes early so I can open up my classroom, read through the plans the teacher left, find a fridge for my lunch, check the teacher's mailbox, and go pee, because gods know when I'll have time for that again... 

I work in schools where I usually either have kids for 5 of 7 or 6 of 8 classes that are about fifty minutes long or 3 out of 4 ninety minute classes. Oftentimes I'll have ""coverage"" during prep times because basically every school is short on subs and I don't have anything to prep, so I'll spend my extra period(s) covering for other teachers that are out but didn't get their own sub. 

Class always starts with introducing myself, taking roll, and introducing the  work left for us by the teacher. While kids are working I'm around the classroom answering questions, keeping kids on task, confiscating cellphones, and/or praising the kids who aren't being pains in my bum. Repeat 3-5x per day, depending on schedule. 

The kids and classrooms are often new to me. Teachers don't have / use enough sick days that I get to be in the same class more than twice very often, though I am pretty consistent in the schools I go to.

I usually spend lunch schmoozing and prep cleaning / organizing. I normally get to leave between 2:30 and 4 pm.

463,"Also a registered nurse!

I work primarily within the realm of cardiology in a critical care setting (the only thing we do not do that ICU can is anything involving care of an intubated patient; we simply lack the resources for that). What we see are mostly heart attacks, people who require urgent pacemakers due to symptomatic bradycardia/AV block, those with deadly arrhythmias (such as ventricular tachycardia), and the really bad heart failure patients (usually requiring BiPap and/or inotropes). We sometimes get internal medicine patients who are very sick (i.e. diabetic ketoacidosis, really bad COPD exacerbations, drug overdoses), but they're the minority. I work 12 hour shifts and, within that timeframe, things can change rapidly. We once went from coasting along to having to code two patients at once.

Basically, my day starts off with getting my assignment and receiving report. I sit down, interpret my ECG strips, and go over what medications I have to give that day. I also mentally sort what I need to do during my shift - for example, if any of my patients need to go for tests or require dressing changes. Then I go assess my patients, usually starting with the most unstable if there is one in my assignment. After assessments, I try to fit in a bit of charting, then go around and give out my medications.

After that is anyone's guess what happens! I do more charting, answer call bells, give out medications, do some more charting, round with the doctor when he/she arrives, process doctors' orders, more charting, periodically interpret/record ECG strips, respond to any changes in my patients' conditions, update charge nurse of anything major going on, help out my co-workers if I'm able, and of course, do more charting. I always have a rough idea of when I should get things done, but like I said, things can change rapidly, so I mostly play things by ear.",1

My patients (all ages) have all kinds of problems while chronic (low back) pain being the most common. I mainly choose active methods over passive ones so most of the work is done by my patients, but I like to exercise together with back and neck pain patients.

My situation is a little different than maybe some others who draw blood at work, in that all I do is draw blood. I'm not an MA or anything else, only a certified phlebotomist. This means that I was able to get very good at it very quickly (I draw anywhere from 40-150 patients per week as a part-time employee, whereas nurses or MAs, etc. may only draw that many people in 2-4 weeks). As such, I've had many patients who come to where I work and warn me that at the hospital, they had to be drawn by the head nurse or even the anesthesiologist - and I (and any of my coworkers) am able to draw them on the first try with no trouble.

467,"I've seen a lot of women having heart attacks and they have all displayed the typical ""classic"" heart attack signs and symptoms.  They describe crushing, squeezing, or heavy pain in the center of their chest, often shortness of breath, pain radiation to the jaw or L arm, and they have all had an intense sense of fear/impending doom.  

There is always the possibility of having an atypical presentation though, such as nausea which won't go away, ""not feeling right"", and abnormal weakness/fatigue.  These types of symptoms are more common in the elderly/diabetic community. 

If you have a strong history of heart disease in your family, you can ask your primary care doctor to refer you to a cardiologist so you can get a cardiac stress test (walking/running on a treadmill hooked up to an EKG).  The entire test takes about an hour and can help see if there's any signs that suggest heart disease.  ",1

My dad had a heart attack last summer. He had chest pain, and his dad died of a heart attack, so he went to the hospital. Lucky him, because he was in the hospital with a cardiologist present when he actually had the heart attack. They were able to act very quickly, and that's probably why he didn't suffer any permanent damage. He has recovered fully.

I was shaking and my heart rate was high (I was able to have my son grab a pulse oximeter).  My poor teenage boys had to call an ambulance, and they were literally going to send me home from the ER because all the tests were coming back fine.  The only thing that caught it was my troponin levels increased-that’s how they knew heart damage had occurred.  It was labeled NSTEMI.  We never did find the cause-it wasn’t due to a blockage, so the doctors attributed it to an arrhythmia.  They haven’t found the arrhythmia problem to this day, I’m not on any blood thinners, and the cardiac doctors have given me a clean bill of health.  I still get concerned whenever I start getting hot/sweaty/nauseous at all, since I would have never expected those to be associated with having a heart attack, especially in my forties.

I was on campus when it happened.  Buying breakfast before class, when suddenly I had a hard time breathing.  It was like the air was too warm to breathe.  I collected my breakfast, put it in my bag and quickly took my stuff to the first aid room.  I then collapsed on the floor, took my jacket, scarf, hoodie and hat off, and security called for first aid.  They called the ambulance who thought it was either asthma, acid reflux, anxiety, or an allergic reaction.  We decided to go to the hospital.  They took an EKG and said something isn't right.  Immediately to the trauma bay and this point onwards is a bit of a blur in my memory.  But they transferred me to another hospital.  They took me to the Cath Lab and put a stent in my artery via my wrist.  It was incredibly painful.  There was also something heavy on my chest. The pain from the heart attack combined with whatever heavy item was on my chest, made me feel really nauseous and unwell.  After surgery, I was in the hospital for 6 days.  I couldn't move my wrist for 24 hours, and an IV line was put in my other arm, so I couldn't move that either.  My parents had to help me with meals because of both arms being immovable.  I also hadn't eaten since the night before because my breakfast was still in my bag.  I was the youngest on the ward.  This was 2 months ago.  And I am still learning how to deal with it day by day.  I have 5 new meds to take.  I gotta check my weight everyday, and my blood pressure, and heart rate have to be monitored.  I got a Fitbit to monitor my heart rate since the clinics are closed.

477,"I had my first one at 18 years old. My entire left side went numb, I became extremely dizzy, disoriented, cold sweats and nauseated. I went to the hospital and was told my troponin levels were elevated and I likely experienced a ""heart related event."" I was never told it was a 'heart attack' but it was more likely a 'transient ischemic attack.' In any case, both of those events are centered around the inability to get oxygen normally to a part of the body (brain/heart/lungs) due to a clot or other vascular issue. I was given no meds, not asked to stay for observation, nothing.

The wildest thing to me is that at that time, it was well-known that I was having issues with my energy/tiredness due to my heart condition. I had surgery as a baby and needed surgery less than a year after this even to close an atrial septal defect in the middle of the atria of my heart that had gotten to be 15 mm wide.

I do not think women are taken as seriously as men when it comes to heart attacks. Men have symptoms that are more ""textbook"" while women definitely do not.

480,"I was 32, a Kindergarten teacher. It was 1995. I’d been taking a triptan drug for migraine headaches for a couple of years. This one particular occasion, a few hours after I took the tablet, I began to feel terrible pressure in my chest and up into the left side of my jaw. I honestly thought it was indigestion at first and chewed some antacid tablets. The pressure and feeling of panic grew. I called my parents. They got me and drove me to the local ER. 

It was set up with a “triage” nurse at a desk where you came in. The nurse wrote down your symptoms and sent your name to the back. You were told to go to the waiting area and wait until a nurse came out and called your name. 

So, I went to the desk and said I was having chest pains and was starting to feel nauseated. The nurse looked at me and said, “Well, you’re not having a heart attack. Go sit over there and wait for someone to call you.” We sat down. I remember that I started sweating and I was moaning as the pain in my chest intensified. It was very crowded, children crying, noise, smells...we’d been waiting over an hour when I found myself suddenly on my hands and knees puking on some random guy’s foot. 

Just at that moment one of the ER nurses came out from the treatment area to call the next patient and saw me. Turns out she was the mother of one of my students. She rushed me to the back, heard the words “chest pain” and had the doctor, an IV, nitro, EKG all inside 15 minutes. 

I was in the ICU for 2 days, had a cardiac cath, and stress test. It was determined that I had no blockage or other cardiac disease. However, the triptan migraine drug had caused me to have spasms in my coronary artery. They were severe enough to cause a myocardial infarction that left me with moderate heart damage.",1
481,"Not me, but my mother. A few weeks ago, my mother decided to go out and hang out with her friend. That night, I was surprised that I didn't get a goodnight text or any of the sort as she would always either call me or text me. I thought nothing of it as she probably fell asleep. The next morning, I noticed how my mother wasn't home. Once again, I thought nothing of it and that she probably wanted to spend more time with her friend. 

The next day, I was starting to get worried until she called me. She said that she was in the hospital, and that she ended up getting a heart attack. I gave my step father the phone as she wanted to talk to him, and he didn't even believe her. He truly didn't believe that my mother was in the hospital and just passed it off as ""trying to start an argument."" It took nearly an hour for him to realize that my mother was serious as he could hear one of the machines through the phone. I had to stay away from my step father that weekend as I would have cursed him out for that. 

Two days later, we picked my mother up from the hospital, and we learned that she was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. During the time at home, she always said how her shoulder hurts, and I had to massage it time to time. She also had many dark bruises on her arms. A few weeks later she is doing fine. Her shoulder still hurts but it's getting better. I'm just happy that she's here with me.

She woke up in the night and was vomiting and my dad went to help her.  He said that she went all floppy and clammy and very pale.  My dad was in the army for 24 years and he’s had some medical training so he guessed she was having a heart attack and called 999 immediately.  My mum didn’t even want him to call the ambulance because she didn’t think it could be that serious. 

When they arrived they did tests and said that she had had a heart attack.  She was denying it even to the paramedics!

She had smoked since she was 15 so she quit straight away and cleaned up her diet, as well as going on several medications.  4 years later and she’s fine! She was also diagnosed as pre-diabetic but she’s managed to control that.

I wasn’t actually there for any of this because this took place during my first year at uni.  But yeah, even my mum, in the midst of a heart attack, was denying that she was having a heart attack.

It takes time for arteriosclerosis to build up in your blood vessels and cause a blockage, and it’s very unlikely to happen by the time you’re 16. It’s possible that you have another cardiac issue, such as an arrhythmia, but what is much more likely is anxiety attacks. They’re extremely common and can mimic a lot of the symptoms of a heart attack (ie. difficulty breathing, chest pain, shaking, sweating, nausea, headache, etc.). I suspect that’s probably why your doctor said ‘it’s nothing’ in response to your symptoms. They can feel like you’re dying but have no lasting effects, so it’s hard for medical professionals to detect them once they’re over.",1

Not a ""feeling"" I ever want to experience again, but very quickly becomes obvious it's not just anxiety/attack and didnt go away at all for me, so I wouldn't worry too much but most definitely speak to your doctor and explain your worries, and a simple test should hopefully be able to put your mind at ease.

About three years ago I started getting horrible chest pains, sweating, dizziness. I was young and healthy and there were no risk factors. But I went to A&E because it was bloody terrifying. They couldn't find anything wrong, but said its good that I came because it's better safe than sorry with chest pain. This happened twice more, and I got diagnosed with costochondritis - but the important thing is, each time I was reassured that I did the right thing by going to the hospital.

Turns out it was anxiety, and I had no idea because I didn’t “feel” anxious at the time. 
Not saying what you’ve got going on IS anxiety, but just keep an open mind because even if you’re not feeling anxious or don’t think anything anxiety-inducing has happened, anxiety attacks can still get ya! 

Also, I was diagnosed with some sort of somatic personality disorder (I forget the name, just remember it had somatic in it, bc that was literally 15 years ago and after therapy I managed to “fix” it for the most part, although on rare occasions I’ll catch myself doing it) - when I get super emotional (whether it’s anger/sadness/fear) instead of “feeling” that emotion like most people do, I manifest it into physical symptoms. A lot of times I wouldn’t realize I was angry/upset/whatever, I’d just get the physical symptom and be like wtf is wrong with my body. 

It’s not unheard of to be young and have a heart condition, my brother had lots of chest pain/heart attack feelings and found out that while he does, in fact, have anxiety, he also has a valve issue that causes some of the chest pain. Just keep an open mind though, like I said, anxiety/other issues can still be a problem even if you don’t feel anxious/whatever emotion when it’s happening!",1

Yeah, I have a friend who had to have open heart surgery when he was about 12/13 for a valve issue that meant he fainted whenever he got too excited. I don't think it's necessarily something like that, but where I don't know a lot about anxiety I know even less about heart conditions. Considering I've been having this on and off for 2 years now, I don't know why I've never really looked into potential causes. At the end of the day, I think it's down to my somewhat cavalier approach to my health. If I'm not dying, it's not a problem, and if I am dying well it'll happen sooner or later so it's still not a massive problem in my eyes. Maybe a cynical approach, potentially even a worrying one if I'm honest, but I've never been too bothered about the idea of my own death.",1
510,"I’ve been dealing with stomach pain for the past year.  Had an endoscopy, came back ok.  Had a HIDA scan, also ok.  My first gastroenterologist thought my anxiety could be the cause.  Got a therapist, started back on anxiety meds, feel pretty good anxiety wise.  Stomach pain still there.  Got a new doctor who I just met with last week over telemedicine.  Doctor suspects functional dyspepsia but admits that diagnosis can refer to a wide range of things.  I am now taking Nexium for a few month to see if that helps get everything to calm down.  

It sucks, I feel like there isn’t a good answer to help with this.  My stomach hurts literally every day, just varying degrees.  I’ve accepted it more lately but sometimes it just knocks me out.  I’ve tried so many different things: DGL, zantac, Pepcid, FDgard (this might have helped a little but is super expensive), Prilosec (never for more than one month so doctor now wants me to try PPI for several months), marshmallow root.  The closest thing that came to helping especially with the heartburn was Gaviscon Advance (UK formula) but it’s made with an artificial sweetener and that was starting to hurt my stomach.

If the Nexium doesn’t work, I’m ready to do a complete overhaul of my diet.  I did try to eat better and that sometimes helps, but then I can eat something healthy like a salad that usually doesn’t bother me and it will.  It doesn’t seem like there is any rhyme or reason to what hurts me and what is ok.

Had my gallbladder removed in Jan. Still no relief. Then they diagnosed functional dyspepsia. Gave me some amitriptyline and said to eat using the FODMAP diet.

Fast forward a few weeks, she's been exhausted. She's missed so much work because she's ready to nap by 2pm, and needs to go home. She hasn't felt heavy and leaden since that night, but her chest and back felt really tight. After 3 weeks of feeling like this, she finally went to a hospital. Turns out she had a ""serious cardiac event"" and needed a stent put in. She was hospitalized for about a week. 

She said it never felt painful or sharp, and it didn't feel sudden like in movies.

513,"I haven't had a heart attack, but since these stories are being shared I wanted to note the difference between cardiac arrest and a heart attack. My father had a heart attack without going into arrest and somehow this wasn't communicated to my brother or me so we didn't fully grasp what was happening, and I've since heard many people dismiss their symptoms because they don't match a movie scenario.

Below is an abbreviated version from the [American Heart Association](http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks/heart-attack-or-sudden-cardiac-arrest-how-are-they-different), but they have the full signs and symptoms of a heart attack or stroke on their website. As well as info on Hands-Only CPR. Hopefully okay to share here.

""People often use these terms interchangeably, but they are not synonyms. A heart attack is when blood flow to the heart is blocked, and sudden cardiac arrest is when the heart malfunctions and suddenly stops beating unexpectedly. A heart attack is a “circulation” problem and sudden cardiac arrest is an “electrical” problem.
 
Symptoms of a heart attack may be immediate and intense. More often, though, symptoms start slowly and persist for hours, days or weeks before a heart attack. Unlike with sudden cardiac arrest, the heart usually does not stop beating during a heart attack. The heart attack symptoms in women can be different than men.

Sudden cardiac arrest occurs suddenly and often without warning. It is triggered by an electrical malfunction in the heart that causes an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). With its pumping action disrupted, the heart cannot pump blood to the brain, lungs and other organs. Seconds later, a person loses consciousness and has no pulse. Death occurs within minutes if the victim does not receive treatment.""


",1
514,"This question is SO IMPORTANT!!!! I haven’t, but in my life support class we learned it is a fact that heart attacks feel different for women than men. It’s not as widely known as it should be, but women need to know that a heart attack won’t feel/look like the classic signs. ",1
515,"I have not had a heart attack but I am a nurse who works in a hospital unit that deals with them on a regular basis :)

Just for clarification, as another Redditor pointed out, a ""heart attack"" is a term commonly applied to two different scenarios: a blockage in a coronary artery that causes heart muscle damage (myocardial infarction) OR when the heart isn't pumping blood properly and essentially stops (cardiac arrest), causing a person to essentially die unless someone helps (I.e. CPR +/- defibrillation). However, the two aren't necessarily exclusive - a myocardial infarction *can* cause a cardiac arrest if left untreated (though cardiac arrests aren't always caused by myocardial infarctions, and there are different types of cardiac arrests.....yeah, it's complicated lol).

So for this post, I'm going to assume ""heart attack"" to mean myocardial infarction, which is more common but harder to diagnose (because let's be real, if you go into cardiac arrest, you die, and that's not hard to miss).

The classic symptoms of a myocardial infarction are:

* Chest pain or pressure (often described as squeezing, like a band over the chest, or ""like an elephant sitting on the chest"")
* Pain radiating to the left arm and/or jaw
* Shortness of breath
* Nausea +/- vomiting
* Sweating
* Just generally feeling that something is very wrong

However, I've also seen lots of people say they had vague symptoms.

Most common of the subtle symptoms is the feeling of indigestion or heartburn. I can't count the amount of times I've heard the story of ""ate a big meal, went to bed, woke up with indigestion, took an antacid, and still felt like shit, continued to take antacids, and when I felt really unwell, went to the hospital."" The general rule of thumb I like to stick to is, if you're having heartburn and it won't go away with heartburn treatment, see a doctor. Even if it's ""just"" heartburn, you'll want to get it treated, anyway, because if left uncontrolled, it can damage your esophagus.

Other vague symptoms would be things like back pain, arm pain, nausea, intense fatigue, and dizziness. In fact, a couple of times, I've had patients who had no symptoms at all until we ran some tests on them; this is most common in people with diabetes.

While women are more likely to have the non-traditional signs and symptoms, men can have them, too, just like women can also have the classic signs. In fact, my first patient with a silent heart attack (no signs or symptoms) was a man!

So yeah, it's not very cut and dry but if you are ever concerned, please just call 911 (or whatever number you call for an ambulance) and get yourself to a hospital. Even if it turns out to be nothing, don't feel embarrassed or feel like you've wasted our time. We always take potential cardiac symptoms seriously because it's hard for us to tell, too, based on signs and symptoms alone, and the tests are fairly easy and quick. And  like a lot of other major ailments, it's best to get treated early rather than let it go on and on, potentially causing major damage.

Lastly, because I always get messaged, *please* no one ask me medical questions about you or a specific person. I cannot make assessments and give advice over the internet. If you have concerns about yourself or a loved one, please see a doctor in person.",1
516,"My mom had one last year and said it wasn't what men are known to experience at all. She had gone to bed and felt uneasy, said her heart started to ""smash and bang"" and generally felt anxious and unwell. She said she just knew something was wrong and suspected a heart attack, as they run in the family (she was the fourth of her siblings to have one within a three-year span) and my grandmother had died of one when I was a baby. My dad drove her to the hospital and it was confirmed she had a ""mild, non-stemi"" heart attack.

The signs and symptoms are really variable across the board.

Quoted directly from the linked page from the American Heart Association:

>“Although men and women can experience chest pressure that feels like an elephant sitting across the chest, women can experience a heart attack without chest pressure, ” said Nieca Goldberg, M.D., medical director for the Joan H. Tisch Center for Women's Health at NYU’s Langone Medical Center and an American Heart Association volunteer. “Instead they may experience shortness of breath, pressure or pain in the lower chest or upper abdomen, dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting, upper back pressure or extreme fatigue.”

Or from the [Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.ca/heart/conditions/heart-attack):

>Women generally recognize the “Hollywood heart attack” with chest-clutching, crushing pain.

The main thing is my health though. I've never had this many problems before. I don't know if unexplained aches and pains is just a fact of life, but I just turned 22. Two years ago I was fine but now I just feel like everything's going wrong?  I've had depression since I was 14, but I've not had a bout of it for a few months. Since around that age I would get colds at least once a month, but again that's calmed down. I fell on my tailbone when I was younger, the pain eased off but it's sort of returning.

Other issues: chest pains. I had a chest infection 2 years ago and ended up with stabbing pains, which the doctor told me was just muscle inflammation and it would go away in a month or so. I STILL HAVE THEM. After about 3 months I went back to the doctor, who then diagnosed it as panic attacks to go with my depression & anxiety. Right. So I made myself feel like I was having a heart attack three times a day? I had no previous history of it so I disagreed. Then I was told that no, it was potentially a blood clot and I had to have a load of testing done for that, but nope. Now i've been told it's probably (note, probably) costochondritis. Doctor says it will go away. Research says if I've had it for this long it's probably chronic, which upsets the hell out of me. No one seems to understand how debilitating it is, I get told I'm making it up, I'm exaggerating, I'm being silly, all sorts.

My back pain is really killing me lately. It's hard to work 8 hours a day at a desk, on top of that I 2 hour round trip commute in which I have to sit in a car, so that's 10 hours a day sat down. And because of the chest pain, guess what, I can't do many forms of exercise! Yay for me! I can swim, 9 times out of 10 I don't get any chest pain. I just get headaches from the chlorine. Aerobics, running or any kind of jumping around makes me feel like I'm having a heart attack. I can't even cycle, which is my favourite thing to do but it's just not worth the pain. Yet I will also get chest pains when I'm just sat down doing nothing. ARGH.

My periods are also really fucked up lately. The pain...

Oh. and a recurring stomach ulcer. Lets just throw that into the mix.  And a newly gained wheat intolerance.

Plenty more to rant about but I will stop... I'm fine for a while and then everything happens at once and all I can do is collapse into bed and cry.

I guess you could say I feel like my body's failing me and I'm only 22.

My chosen field was political, and even though I'm competent, with experience to back me up, I'm often passed up for women with less...troublesome...figures. 

The ""slutty"" thing is usually by other girls (especially in middle school and high school) and by people my parents' age. Like, ""monalisas, you don't want people to get the wrong opinion about you, so make sure you cover up!"" At the same time, they're telling me to ""dress to accentuate your figure!""

I don't always feel hungry. Often, I will feel fine until I realise I haven't eaten in 8 hours and I have 10 minutes to get some food into me before I pass out.

One full meal later, I felt on top of the world.

I think I told the doctor this last time that it felt like my reproductive organs had a migraine, and then someone was intermittently hitting me with a hammer on top of that.

Zofran + ibuprofen + tyelenol + oxycodone makes it bearable, if you want to sit in a hospital bed for 3 hours while they check you out at the ER.

If he is overprotective and unreasonable, the bad news is that he is probably going to stay that way. However, you can make the situation easier on everyone by introducing yourself to her dad and making a good impression. Overprotective fathers usually prefer to know who they're dealing with (the secrecy of going out with ""some random guy"" is shady to them) and a brief introduction can save a lot of trouble. Be polite and well mannered, don't be afraid to make eye contact, look presentable (I'm not talking suit and tie, but leaving the stained tshirt, basketball shorts, and flip flops at home can make a big difference). If he wants her home at a certain time, respect that. Let him know what you guys are doing (""Thank you for letting me take her out to the movies, we'll be back by 11."")

551,"She should have never been left alone the day after spinal surgery :( Sepsis is a real thing, it can kill you, and definitely put her into the state she was in. With treatment, she should go back to normal.

If she goes into a nursing home, they will make her spend down all of her assets to 8K before medicaid will kick in. It also must be medically necessary. Her health insurance may provide nursing care once or twice a day, but also only if medically necessary. You could hire someone who does home health care by the hour, or to stop in once a day and check on her.

How about seeing if she'd be interested in a roommate? Someone to help with the expenses, and keep an eye on her?

As far as me, I moved my Mom to a house a 1/2 mile from me. We each maintain our autonomy, but I can easily check in on her regularly and/or run down if she needs anything.

If either of my parents get to the point they can't care for themselves, they will always be 100% welcome in my home, and I will always care for them. They did an amazing job raising me, and I will always be there for them. That being said, that solution isn't for everyone, and there is no 'right' or 'wrong', just what is right for you, and right for them. Best wishes, and good luck.",1
552,"Ooof,  that's hard,  OP.   

Talk to the hospital and ask them to point you toward local resources.   Many communities or regions have counselors that will help you look at your options,  know what's available. 

My mom is in her 90s; my dad passed a few years ago at 93.  They lived in the house I grew up in,  on their own,  too a ripe old age, but we've talked to these agencies about what to do eventually. ",1
553,"I'm lucky (well not really), but both my parents have passed away so I won't ever have to deal with this. My dad died of a plane crash (mechanical issues) at 55. He did have congestive heart failure, diabetes, and a host of other issues at the time, but wasn't generally debilitated. A year later my mom was diagnosed with kidney cancer that had already spread everywhere. It was only a month between her diagnosis and her passing. My sister and my aunts were the ones who took her to all her doctor's appointments and she lived in the spare bedroom at my sister's house during that last month until she was in the hospital and then at home hospice for 2 days (I live a state away). It sucks that they're gone obviously, but one of the silver linings is that I won't have to deal with elder care. 

For OP, getting a social worker to start planning how to take care of things would be ideal. Things like having a home care nurse stop by daily to check on her may be beneficial. Getting someone who knows what programs are available would be super helpful. ",1
554,"Your mom is 62 -- can she get Medicaid or Medicare Part A? They will pay for nursing care. You'll have to look into your state's requirements for applying. There's generally a 60-month lookback rule when applying for Medicaid, so if your mom needs to go into nursing care NOW, you won't be able to hide assets (i.e., consider transferring them to a kid) without a penalty (this of course may also differ by state; I have no idea). 

I'd talk to your mom about a will, a living will, power of attorney, financial power of attorney, etc., when/if she is able. As far as what you're discussing of someone checking in on her...you mean like a home nurse? I'd run that by the hospital or your mom's GP. Insurance may cover it because it may be cheaper for them to do that than to risk more hospitalization.



As for my own personal situation...my mom is in her late 50s and my dad is retired and in his early 60s. Mom is half-blind from a stroke, has diabetes, mobility problems, etc. Dad is mostly immobile. How they're making it financially is beyond me. They are one sort-of-big disaster away from losing their house.

I have printed out a bunch of applications for senior co-op apartments that are subsidized in the area: it would help them out a lot financially, they'd have fewer home responsibilities, etc. I filled out almost all of it except for signatures They refuse to fill it out.

It's very frustrating. When my dad dies, my mom will get almost nothing -- no where near enough to live on, not even when she turns 62. I dread the day, to be honest with you. Neither of my parents were 'good' parents (narcissism) and I can't allow her toxicity into my house. My family comes first.

If my mom dies, my dad is also screwed. He can do almost nothing for himself. He does have mobility problems, but this began long before that. He doesn't know how to do simple self-care things. My mom has told me several times, ""You'll have to come over and pay the bills, make him dinner..."" Nope. I will help where I can, but he will have to learn and in-home help will have to provide the rest. I have a fledgling family to care for. I can't take on doing everything for another.

When the day comes that one of them wants to move in with me, I'll be screamed at, cussed out, etc., for my refusal. It'll be, ""You never helped us!"" Then I'll be standing there saying, ""Really? I helped you with a bunch of housework, gave you opportunities to improve your financial situation, and you shrugged it all off.""

They are the sorts of people who will be speeding toward a wall. You scream, ""You're going to hit that wall!"" They look at you blankly and say, ""Yeah, but not yet, so we're going to keep speeding."" Then they either just barely miss it or slam head-on. Then they climb from the wreckage and go, ""Oh my God, we hit the wall!"" Ya think?

",1
555,"I guess they're fortunate because I'm a trained nurse so they know that if things get bad I would be more than happy to move back in with them and take up full time care. My parents put their life and soul into raising me so I wouldn't even think twice about trying to return the favour. My parents have eachother though and are still madly in love. My dad had a stroke last year and my mother was very good at looking after him. Likewise, my mother has had several lapses of cancer over the year and my dad was there to look after her.

For your situation I understand it's more tough. I'm passing no judgement on you as a person but your mother should never have been left alone after major surgery such as spinal. That's on the hospital staff also because they should know to never discharge someone who had serious treatment to an empty house unless there was someone looking after her.

I don't really know what to say to you. Your options are either move in with her and try take some of the care on yourself (which I know can be very personally demanding and even if you do this you'll still need assistance from trained professionals), hire private carers to come see her several times a day, or look into putting her into a facility where she can be appropriately cared for. All of these options are tough and expensive and I really feel for you. 

Seek input from social services; it's their job to help people in your situation find the most appropriate solution to looking after your mother. I'm not from America so unfortunately I don't know an awful lot about your healthcare system or insurance or anything like that, but there definitely is help available you just need to ask for it and keep asking for it.

Also, bear in mind that if the hospital can cure the sepsis then it's likely a lot of her medical problems such as the hallucinations may go away so this situation may not be as tough in the future as it is now. Talk to her physician about this. 

Best of luck, I honestly wish you all the best. ",1
556,"A very similar thing happened with my dad last year. He had surgery for colon cancer that went fine but later developed sepsis and ended up in a coma. It was awful. He slowly recovered but apparently being under heavy sedation for a long period of time leads to some pretty serious issues, including a loss of muscle strength. My dad had trouble getting around before but now can't stand unaided and can barely walk. This means he can no longer live in his isolated mountain home filled with stairs. 

For awhile my he was staying with my younger brother, who owns a house, but that wasn't working out and actually almost destroyed their relationship, so I found a two bedroom apt and my dad moved in with me. We split the rent and bills just like roommates and so far it's worked out well. But my dad doesn't require any caretaking really. Obviously I want him to live forever but honestly I hope he dies before his body or mind fails completely. I know that sounds awful but I have no idea what we'll do if he requires long term care. None of us can afford it.",1
557,"As far as the first incident goes its a bit foggy still. The information is very jumbled because I could never get a straight answer. I had tried calling her when she lived further away. She's always been good about answering the phone or getting back to me within the hour during normal hours. When I didn't hear from her I called her work and she hadn't shown up but they didn't give me any information as to whether she called out or not. I called my uncle who lived closer to her than I did to see if he had heard from her. She had called him saying she couldn't get out of bed. So he took her to the hospital. She was fine the next day. Completely back to normal. She stayed with my uncle on that occasion. 

She has no memory of that incident. 

About a month later, she sent me a text saying her primary thinks she had a stroke. She had driven to her primary care doctor, confused, and been told that they should probably call an ambulance for her and she refused. She drove herself home. I called her and told her to call an ambulance, but she didn't want to deal with the cost. She's the most bull headed human being I know. She drove herself to the hospital and was told in the ER that she had no signs of a stroke. I picked her up from the hospital when I got there and she was completely out of it. The clarity she had on the phone was gone. The next morning I woke up to her unable to figure out how to put her underwear on or where anything was in the house. 

I spent much of the next few weeks in her apartment trying to take care of her and back and forth between my place and the doctors office trying to figure out what had happened. They still cant tell us exactly what happened. They blame it on a mixed combination of medications. 

She doesn't remember the events of about 4-5 days for that incident. 

With it happening more than once, I find it hard to believe that it was just medication, but they keep trying to shove that answer down my throat. 


I will absolutely go to her primary with her to see what we can find out. She is currently in the hospital still, and I've been working with a caseworker to try to get her placed in rehab for physical therapy and to have a little more time with care, but all of the places are declining her because she's able to walk 200 feet. Her insurance won't cover much because she's taken the minimum insurance as she does. 

I will see if they have a senior care specialist though. And see if there are any services for where we live. ",1
558,"She is slowly getting back to normal. I'm afraid this will happen again, though. Considering the complete memory loss has happened more than once prior to the surgery I don't feel like sepsis was the ONLY culprit here. I do feel like it played a nice big part in the hallucinations, though. 

I honestly don't think she has more than 5K in assets aside from owning her car. 

I know she would hate a roommate. I've talked to her about it before, but shes one of those people who have lived alone so long that they're set in their ways. She hasn't had anyone but me living with her since I was 8mos old. Almost 25 years. I wish she'd let a roommate live with her. It'd make life a heck of a lot easier. :P 

I think I might work on finding her a place that is close to me like you've done with your mother. For the most part shes able to function completely normally. Its just when she has the episodes that shes been having this year that I get up in arms worried about her being by herself. On top of the fact that shes getting older, I feel like I might be jumping the gun and trying to be overly cautious with worry. ",1
559,"The rehab place is ideal - I'm a CNA in a facility like that. We usually have patients stay 2-3 weeks post surgery to get them back on their feet. As soon as you mentioned her confusion, I immediately jumped to infection, so sepsis was unsurprising. Even something as simple as a UTI can make geriatric patients lose their marbles. It's the most bizarre thing... One day they'll be totally with it and clear as day, the next they are telling you that they are pregnant and need to get to the hospital to give birth to a beautiful baby boy. If you can get her into a rehab facility, I definitely recommend it. There are things such as home health aides who can come however often you like, but that one-on-one attention can sometimes be much more expensive. My grandfather is in his 70s and had trouble taking care of a leg wound - being terrified of doctors and too stubborn to admit he needed help, it progressed to a stage 4 leg ulcer (gaping hole in his leg). We did phased him down care-wise slowly: hospital -> rehab -> home health nurse daily (to help him shower and do dressing changes) -> home health nurse weekly -> no nurse, just check-ins with my mom. Definitely see if she has been assigned a social worker - they can direct you to facilities and help you figure out what the best course of action will be for her. ",1
560,If the time hasn't already passed you should definitely talk to your mom about upping her insurance when open enrollment comes. ,1
561,"First off, I want to say that I'm very sorry I don't have a solution and that you have to go through this. I know how draining and challenging it is, so I wish you much strength.

> About a month later, she sent me a text saying her primary thinks she had a stroke.

I am SO not a medical expert, but my MIL had a similar event of confusion and it was probably a minor stroke, or what they more accurately call a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA). She didn't suffer the classic symptoms of a major stroke, but instead she went from being really mentally sharp and able to care for herself, to suddenly and abruptly being unable to finish her sentences, and unable to do tasks completely herself. She would ""pantomime"" doing things like brushing her teeth, but she wasn't actually doing it. 

She had the presence of mind to know she was in trouble and asked a neighbor to take her to the hospital. When we went to her house to collect her things, it was clear she was mentally not quite right that day - things a bit scattered and out of place in a weird way.

Anyway, although she lived less than 5 miles away, she came to live with her son and I when they sent her home from the hospital. We knew one day this would be a likely event, but it was sudden and we were utterly unprepared for how much surveillance she required to be safe and to be cared for. I didn't sleep a wink for the few days she was with us.

She had another TIA, more recognizable as a stroke, the third night she was with us during dinner. At first I wasn't sure if it was significant, but I googled her symptoms and called an ambulance immediately. At the hospital they confirmed it was TIA. After a few days of hospital care, they started discussing rehabilitation programs for her. I aggressively advocated for finding a skilled facility that she could live in rather than coming to live with us.

Sadly, I don't have much advice to offer because for one thing, MIL never made it home from the hospital - she had a major stroke and died before she could be discharged. Additionally, she was 86 years old, so had Medicare and supplemental insurance, and she had financial reserves to draw on if she had had to pay out of pocket for skilled nursing care.

And ultimately, as hard as it was on us, we would have of course taken her in if the skilled care didn't work out. I was just deeply concerned about our ability to care for her properly with the level of safety and comfort she needed/deserved. But we would have given it every effort.

Years earlier MIL dealt with her sister no longer being able to live on her own. Fortunately, the sister had purchased specific insurance to cover skilled care in a home for a few years, so when the sister's Alzheimers became too much to handle amongst us, she was well cared for in a home for the rest of her life. She actually did quite well there.

MIL had two cats, we have two cats. All four cats are currently under our roof, albeit, not sharing space quite yet. One of my MIL's cats is an alpha female, and well, isn't respecting the fact that I'm doing *her* a favor by bringing her in. She makes a beeline to start trouble when I let her out in the same space as my cats. I'm working on slowly getting everyone used to each other by stages.",1

We love each other and both want to make each other feel good, and we also firmly believe the other shouldn’t make themselves uncomfortable just to please us, so sex is very enthusiastic and loving. 

We started out vanilla and were that way for a long time, but a few years ago he confessed to me that he likes when women are dominant. We’ve roleplayed a lot of (very gentle, loving) femdom scenarios and it’s been really fun. I’m not submissive at all, but I’ve realized I do have a dominant side, which was a big surprise because I’m very mild-mannered and unassertive in my daily life. What we do is a lot less kinky than most people would probably think- my limits are I don’t want to be violent at all towards him or call him any names. I was abused by my mom and groomed by a creepy older man when I was underage, so I tread very carefully with this because of my own trauma, even though I’m in the dominant role during our roleplays. My boyfriend has really, really enjoyed this and I do too!

I also have severe vaginismus and have never been able to have penetrative sex. With years of lidocaine injections in my vagina, I was finally able to insert a tampon a year ago. It will be a while before I can ever have penetrative sex, but we have great non-penetrative sex and my boyfriend is so understanding. For both of us, sex is much more a mental and emotional thing than a physical one. We’re both fortunate- we both always orgasm at least once every time. We’re both pretty reserved sexually outside of when we actually have sex with each other, so it’s actually very surprising how connected and in-tune we are with each other during sex! It’s like we can read each others’ minds, it’s amazing. That emotional connection is so important to me and it really makes me crave him. He’s a gentleman and always makes me cum first, too :) He just makes me feel so loved and safe- he’s both really passionate and really gentle and tender. 

My body has also changed over the years, but luckily, my boyfriend loves that I’m now curvier. I was a size 4 and now I’m a size 12, 5’8”. I was very thin when we got together, and I had no boobs or butt. Now I do, and he loves them. I have a hard time accepting my body but it really flatters me that he seems to like it so much. He told me he actually prefers me curvier than when I was thin, which is sometimes hard to believe because my mom constantly called me fat growing up (even though I was tall and skinny).",1

There were many embarrassing moments spent in the passenger seat trying to disappear while he yelled out the window at someone who had barely offended him with their driving, not knowing if I should confront him about it, and telling myself he'd never act as entitled toward me.  


But he did, and it didn't take long. It started with a ""fuck you"" when I asked him to bring a bowl of veggies from the kitchen to the dining table instead of just sitting there allowing me to serve him AFTER making dinner without his help every day AFTER working 40 hours same as him. And it progressed into literally not ONE word I said being worthy of his time. I couldn't speak without being interrupted, told I was wrong, or googled (to prove I was wrong) right in front of me, and eventually I just stopped speaking at all. All important decisions were made without my input until I no longer felt like a person and left.",1
571,"He required constant admiration, adoration, and strokes, which was exhausting. I had no idea someone could be that needy.  Disagreeing with him about something hurt his feelings. For instance, I wanted a Wendy's hamburger instead of the chicken sandwich, which he wanted me to have. He saw that as a personal affront.  I couldn't ask him to do the simplest thing, without him pouting or having a tantrum. I saw these things early on, but because I'd never encountered these traits in anyone, I ignored them. They were no big deal as he had many good qualities. Regardless, we're divorced now. No more man-children for me.",1
572,"Can I answer as a woman going through her second divorce? 

1st marriage: 
1. That his family made me super uncomfortable with being myself around them. Very controlling and manipulative family. (No matter how many times you tell yourself that your husband is “different” than his parents and siblings, the hard truth is, no, not really - they’re going to perpetuate the very thing they grew up observing from their parents. 
2. Super emotional, insecure, and needy, and immature. And COMPLETELY at the mercy of his family.
3. Snapped at me during stressful moments and completely unable to handle any day to day stress.
4. Repeatedly making me feel insecure by commenting on other attractive girls around us. 

2nd Marriage:
1. Again - A product of his family. If you don’t like his mom OR dad, he may be just exactly like them, especially as the years pass. Probably most definitely IS like them. 
2. Times when I could see that he repeatedly put his own needs ahead of my own. Even as I was accommodating and willing to put his needs first. 
3. Pressured me to marry him before I felt ready (I went a head because I was afraid of losing him if I didn’t) 
4. Super sensitive and manipulative at times. 

Reading thru these I feel like a COMPLETE IDIOT that I ignored these things and actually married these guys. But I tend to see all of the potential in a person instead of who they actually are. And I have often sold myself short, thinking I didn’t deserve better. Don’t do that to yourself. You always deserve the very very best.",1
573,"His spending behavior. Started dating and realized every penny he ever had just burned a hole right through his pocket. I was pretty decent with my money so I figured it would be okay. Long story short 
4 months after we got married while I was at work he found my hidden key to my fireproof lockbox that had all of my legal paperwork and passwords to important accounts (passport, social security card, birth certificate, and my banking information) logged onto my bank account and transferred $15,000 (all of the money I had in the world) to our joint savings account that we had for bill purposes, drained our joint account which had $3,000 that I alone had put in there and ran off with one of our coworkers all within a 9 hour shift before I had any idea what had happened. Because he took all of my savings I no longer had the money to pay any of my bills and got very deep into debt and became homeless because I had no family close to help me or for me to stay with. I was lucky enough to have a car that was paid off and I was able to pay my car insurance and gas so I was able to live in it. It was a little 2003 VW Beetle. I was able to afford a gym membership at Colaw for $5 a month and they had showers I was able to use and I would just go at 2 or 3 A.M. when no one was there to shower and wash my clothes in the shower. It was the hardest year and a half of my life trying to pick the pieces back up. I think it’s where I hit rock bottom, or at least I hope it was rock bottom because if it gets any worse than that I don’t think I’d make it a second time around. 

I was very young (19 I’m now 22) and he and I had many many many more issues that were too sensitive for me to post here that were red flags that I was too ignorant and innocent to see. Though I think this is one of the most important things. Keep your finances separate from your spouse. And DON’T marry anyone who can’t save any money because you’re just going to be in for a really rough life.",1
574,"Lack of sexual chemistry/passion. I know passion fades over time but if it was never there in the first place, that is a red flag. They can look 100% on paper but do not settle for just “nice” or “dependable”.  Life is too short to not have that spark.",1
575,"My ex was a farmer and that all he thought and talked about. Every conversation we had was about cows or feed or tractors. He had no interest in me or my hobbies. He was also a workaholic and an alcoholic, he would wake up at 3:30am and go to work til 4pm and then head straight to the farm and work there til 9pm or later. Then when he got home he’d drink a fifth of whiskey and pass out, I could never understand how he could maintain that schedule. He was a mostly a nice guy and tried hard to be what he thought the American dream was, but emotionally he was unavailable in a big way. I tried to leave him and shit got crazy, he basically stalked me for 6 months begging me to take him back, going so far as to propose to me while we were broken up...I declined but tried to give him a second chance but he didn’t change. I left him for good and he cried and screamed and swore he’d never love again and was married to some other poor girl 6mo later.",1
576,"Drinking habits. I come from a family who only really drink at social occasions or on a night out. He comes from a family who drink to excess all the time at home. 

I have had probably 2 drinks in the last couple of years, the last being on my birthday, he drinks most nights. Not just a little but like generally 12 cans of Guinness original. It’s generally a case of if we have the money he is drinking. Seriously approx £15 a night. 

We don’t go out, so it’s always drinking at home, every birthday/Xmas etc gifts from family members are always alcohol, in which case he will drink more than the normal 12 cans. 

£15 a night may not sound like much but it’s generally at least 5 nights a week and more money than we get to spend on food for the whole family (5). We are permanently skint, never have the money to do anything. The house is always in disarray because I am disabled and he generally doesn’t have the energy/will/whatever to decorate, garden, keep things tidy. 

We are always starting the day off behind as when he drinks the cans just get thrown all over the floor, so it’s tidy up the floor before anything else. 

His drinking has really put me off drinking. I do not want our kids to have his drinking habits (or my eating habits but at least I am trying to change my ways!) but he just won’t stop. 

The amount of times I have heard “that’s it I’m not drinking ever again...I mean it this time” yeah I know he don’t mean it. 

The last was him saying at the end of May, I am not going to drink for the whole of June, if I do I will go to AA. Guess what? He managed not to drink for the first two days, which was because we didn’t have the money for him to drink, then he borrowed money off his mother and has drank every night since. 

I have repeatedly told him that his drinking will cause the end of us, that I can see how the years go by I am getting more and more resentful of it and him and I don’t want to end up bitter and it to ruin us but he just will not change. I have threatened to throw him out if he drinks again, he still drinks. He has tried once in the past to get help from GP but said that the GP was amazed he was only drinking beer and not spirits and seemed to generally not be so concerned once he heard that. 

He won’t go back. 

We are both 40/41, kids are 9,11,12. I have warned him on more than one occasion that if they have his family’s attitude towards drinking when they grow up I will kill him. He just kinda makes approving noises and that’s it. 

There has been numerous occasions where me and the kids can hear him throwing up after too much alcohol, the kids are just used to daddy being drunk (he is not a day drinker as such but will start general once the kids are home from school), recently there have been numerous occasions where I have gone to bed early (7pm ish) as it’s just not enjoyable sitting downstairs with someone getting blasted every single night, and the 12yo will go down for a drink or to use the toilet and daddy is passed out in the chair (always adamant he doesn’t pass out, he “falls asleep”, and then my 12yo locks the house up for him. 

(Kids spends most of their time in their bedrooms but we only have a downstairs bathroom and toilet)

——-
And as I type this I can literally see myself reading someone else’s post and internally screaming “THROW HIM OUT UNTIL (If) HE GETS HELP” but easier said than done irl. 

Tempted to show him this post but I know it will just end up with the same promises and him being depressed for a couple of days until he gives in and drinks again. With that said we again have absolutely no money until we get paid on Monday so I know he will be sober over the weekend, but bet you that come Monday he will be round the corner shop again getting beer.

ETA: neither of us work, I used to be the breadwinner until mental breakdown in 2014/2015, he was the househusband. We have been married 13 years in August. I love him, but I can see it slowly being eroded over the years and turning into resentment. I always lived by myself and supported myself, and am used to doing as such, I have given so much towards this and bent/broke so many of my own internal walls to be with and stay with him.",1

I remember watching the « love the way you lie » Eminem and Rihanna’s music video where Megan Fox and Dominic Monaghan fight and yell at each other before having passionate sex.

578,"Thankfully I didn’t marry the man, but realizing this was part of the reason I got out. He would spend hours ranting about how everyone else was setting him up at work, how he couldn’t catch a break because he was the only honest person in a den of thieves, and he loved to be able to secretly go behind his boss’s back & do things while making sure they didn’t catch him so he could be the smart one who got things accomplished. He lived to one up people while telling stories & blow his accomplishments out of proportion. 

It was bizarre when I finally figured out that he couldn’t be happy unless he was throwing the blame for bad things in his life off onto someone else. I got tired of getting all the faults from his previous failed relationships projected onto me (accusations of infidelity, talking to men with the intent to cheat when we had a conversation in passing, etc).

I had this china set passed down from my great grandparents and while we were living together he would just quietly walk off and grab the plates and teacups, quietly exit to the backyard and smash them on a rock and was calm about it the entire time. He’d come back and act like the argument never happened and would pretend like everything was normal afterwards. Smashed at least 2 plates every night. I no longer have a single piece of the China set. He also broke my moms full wine set that she gave me. After he broke all of my stuff he quit breaking things.",1
581,"I was considering making my own post, but would love to ask your advice if you have a few minutes to spare.  


My friend is in an emotionally manipulative relationship, has been on and off the past two years. She literally was talking about it the night we met two years ago, and here we are and they are still in the same cycle. 

Right now I am OK to help and support but I've had compassion fatigue with it in the past. They break up, she wants to talk about it all the time and it's all she can think about, it eats her up. They get back together, I don't hear from her for weeks because she's soaking up as much of it as she can before it inevitably ends again. They're like a rubber band - one of them pulls away and the other springs back closer and holds on, and vice versa. 

So can I ask, how did you eventually end this cycle? Asking on behalf of my friend, it just seems like it's never going to end. She's been through a lot in life and one time she said to me ""I know this isn't good but I just don't have the fucking energy to fight for something more"" which is heartbreaking but I feel insightful of where her mind is at?

Can I also ask, how can I be a supportive non-judgey friend but help her get to where she needs to be? I know it's her life and she's gotta live it...but I want to do what I can to help. 

Any advice would be hugely helpful please - I am a bit of a loss right now! Sorry for word vomit. Thanks",1
582,"I just got engaged and have been prowling this list just to make sure I’m not missing anything my own partner might be doing and honestly, he has none of these issues. I’m not saying he’s a perfect human being, but our relationship is so strong and so loving. Don’t give up on the idea of true love or of men that actually have their shit together and know how to be good partners. 

I would normally never list all the wonderful things I love about my partner because I don’t like to rub it in anyone’s face, but as proof that amazing men and successful relationships do exist, here’s a snapshot of mine. :)

He’s educated, ambitious but not overly competitive, compassionate, nurturing, funny, intelligent, curious, playful, principled, affectionate... I could go on and on. 

We agree politically and he has even put a ton of time and effort into learning more about the issues I care about (I’m pretty passionate about social justice). 

We split our housework evenly and never keep tabs on what each other has done. 

He never acts jealous or mistrustful. I never feel suspicious or jealous of him because he just makes it so clear to everyone around us that he loves me. 

He loves kids and is an amazing uncle. 

He is soooo supportive. He believes in me and encourages me to follow my dreams. He learns about my ADHD and not only empathizes with my struggles but helps me overcome them in concrete ways. This year he is supporting me financially so I can take time to heal from an incredibly stressful 5 years of grad school that left me emotionally and physically depleted. 

He is close with his family and with my mine. He is a loyal friend and his friends are all amazing people. 

He spends his free time working on hobbies and learning skills. He loves reading, gardening, cooking, and just generally being productive. 

And finally, he is a super generous and passionate lover! He’s a feminist and is working to unlearn harmful male-centric narratives about sex. 

And guess what! He’s not the only one! 

Sorry for the brag. I hope it reaffirms your belief! Mating for life isn’t for everyone but it can definitely be beautiful and happy!",1
583,"Awwww thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm not in a terrible marriage, I truly love my husband...we're just different people. I'm passionate as fuck, and he's  meh.

584,"I feel like it's really easy for anyone on the outside of relationships & who has 5 sentences of background to pass judgment but it wasn't until I was 6 years into this relationship & 2 years into the marriage before I realized it was an issue.  The relationship before my husband was so awful & toxic & scary that being with him finally made my life feel safe & normal.  He has never name called, physically hurt me, played mind games, manipulated me in any way and that was a big change for me so it felt like an incredible relationship.  He is funny, he has a great family, he is a good provider, he would be a wonderful father.  We were part of the same friend group so the first 4 years of our relationship involved being around them.... but then I reconnected with 2 super close girlfriends when their life circumstances changed & made it possible for us to all hang out again. But it was never something he wanted to be a part of if it meant leaving home.  They were more than welcome to visit but if it was going out of town he didn't want to go and that's when I noticed that was only the top of the iceberg, if I was hot he was cold, if I liked this food he hated it, if I liked this show he liked that one.... and so on.... two things we agree on, we love each other & hate the color red.  That's pretty much it. He is good to me & he's a good man. But life is hard when EVERYTHING is a compromise.",1

Unfortunately, it's incredibly hard to believe and work on. I've seen the damage I've done, and the fact that I was doing it unintentionally kind of makes it worse and reinforces the idea that we shouldn't get love or involve ourselves. 

I can feel compassion for groups: whether it's BLM, helping animals, marching for LGBT+ issues, etc. I genuinely want a better world for everyone, even those who might be not great people, but that individual level relationship building skill is not there, and because I didn't grow up with it, recognizing healthy relationships feels impossible. It's so frustrating to see people with functioning relationships and people who care about them and healthily show emotions only to know you can never have the because you only hurt people because you actually can't understand. 

It feels very much like it's either I can continue to break things or I can just abandon it and go help the world at large by doing science for good causes.",1

If you could see you and talk to you then you would give compassion and care to you. Does that make sense?

Books lately have been varied. I replaced my long-expired library card recently because my book buying habit was sending me to financial ruin, and i've basically been reading whatever holds have come through--A Jest of God by Margaret Laurence (canadian lit about a spinster that was weirdly fascinating and relateable), a romance novel (Get a Life Chloe Brown--super cute, light read), Bad with Money by Gaby Dunn (personal finance that doesn't make everything about avocado toast, by a genuinely interesting woman), and now a book on relationships by a divorce lawyer (If You're in My Office It's Already Too Late). It's probably the most i've actually read in a while lately--less time staring at my book collection trying to decide, more time actually trying to finish a book before the due date.

I have started sorting them chronologically and reading his words to me at different points in my life is very comforting even if it is sad and hurts. It's like having him with me and hearing him in a way.

\- Linked to that: Try to keep a recording of their voice. The thought that I will never hear his voice again and maybe forget how it sounded suddenly came to me after he passed and I spent a long time frantically searching for a recording or video where he is speaking.

\- Also linked to that: Take lots of photos. Some people don't like to be photographed but having those pictures will be very important to remember a person.

And one practical note:

You do not want to think about it but death is a bureaucratic nightmare. Funerals are hellishly expensive. If you are the person who will have to take care of that, you will not have time to grieve at first. You will be calling funeral homes and offices and be taking care of arrangements *full-time*.

I’m sure the one appropriating the idea received the “credit” for their behavior.  If not, I’ve more productive things to do than dwell on credit for past work.

One can also see this behavior as a tool.  Rather than have future ideas or work passed over, enlist this person to support your work.  They can also become a supporter for you on future projects, as you are potentially more valuable than others.

She was also a patron of the arts, including Leonardo da Vinci. She was widely loved by both her own people and her brother's and would move freely and without any sort of protection or escort among common people which was incredibly dangerous for most nobility, but she was known to be so charitable and generous that she never came to any harm.

A lot of things have been complicated by corona, as well as the fact that we were living in a different country - I had only been there for a year, arriving a few months before corona struck, so I never had any friends or social support there, and our parents weren't able to come visit, again due to corona. But we're back in our home country now (since a week ago), where we grew up and where our parents live, so we're able to receive so much more support now, and it really is making a huge difference.  
This really is the worst time to be dying, when everything is shut down, and you're not able to do any of the things you want to. And at the same time, the risk of corona itself is something that would likely cut her life even shorter, so we really can't take many risks. Even getting married is proving to be a little difficult.

because of where we live and people assuming I’m not biracial we’ve never had any harassment about our relationship.

Honestly I have trouble believing these other commenters who don’t think they have experienced any racially based harassment. If they’ve never experienced it how could they notice it? I remember walking around with a mixed race black friend of mine, and he insisted on crossing a street to avoid a group of young white men I hadn’t even noticed, but they were all staring him down and seemed to be posturing for a fight.

I'm mixed middle eastern and white (but pretty white passing according to most) and my bf is Chinese. We haven't had issues with racism while traveling, but we have in our home country. However, the racism was more targeted towards him directly, so basically it was strangers being racist and shitty towards him while walking together. 

The first time was when we were 17 or so and this group of white teenage boys started making 'ching chong' and similarly original mocking noises as we passed by. The second time was when we were in our early 20s. My bf and I were walking home together holding hands, and two black girls started yelling at my bf about having a small penis and other disgusting stereotypes when we passed by them. 

The second situation really caught me off guard. Maybe I was really naive, but I didn't expect two individuals who probably had their own experiences with racism to say such garbage about another person.

I don’t know if I can say she passed that down to me, but I know I sure try to be more like her in that aspect. 

This generation is all about self fulfilment, self serving, self protection, self importance. Which are all healthy things, in measure. But I feel the other side - serving others, forgiving others, protecting others - kind of get left behind. Even though they are equally important to self worth and happiness in the long run, I think.

I'm now in the process of learning to love my body and I really really hope my daughter doesn't see the moments when I hate my body. I don't want her to hear me say I'm ugly and fat. I want her to celebrate her life and body and feel confident throughout her life. I just hope I haven't already ruined that for her",1

689,"Lol what is it with rednecks and discussing “when shit hits the fan”? I’m not saying it’s bad, it just seems like something we used to talk about in our family and I never hear it anymore! How we were lucky because we could always grow stuff if we needed to since we had land. We weren’t doomsday preppers or anything but the subject would come up in passing like that and there was a couple guns locked up in the basement “just in case.”",1
690,"For sure! 
Resume wise: you want it to be no longer than a page, and you want a fair bit of white space. It needs to be very easy to read. Reason being, your resume will probably come in a stack of others, and you want your qualifications to be clear in 30 seconds. My mom always said to assume it's being glanced at on a Friday at 5pm. You want them to put it in the 'follow up' pile instead of the trash. 

A lot of people highlight the place where they worked--highlight your job instead, again making it easy for the recruiter to see what you've done. A lot of people also add too much detail under what they've done in each job position. You need a one to two sentence description that both includes buzzwords for your profession (because nowadays we have to make it through a computer system before a person will even see your stuff), and it should be clear and concise. For example, I'm a nurse. When I edit resumes for colleagues, they include things like ""pass pills, take vitals"" in their description. The recruiter is aware that nurses pass pills and take vitals. That description is just extra, useless words. A better descriptor is ""Manage care for post surgical patients with an interdisciplinary team on a high volume unit. Experience with wound vacs and ventilators. Created a new report format and blood clot prevention form for the unit."" Now I have buzzwords (manage, care, high volume, interdisciplinary) and added experience others may not have and things I've done that go above and beyond. If they want to know more, they'll call me for an interview. 

I'd recommend a cover letter. And honestly I'd look up templates online for your job type, because it varies and I'm not as good with those.

When I go for an interview, I've looked up usual nursing interview questions online and practiced my answers. I'll also have three or four anecdotes I can use to make answers more personal. If they ask about my weakness, I tell them and then follow up with how I'm working on improving. At the end of the interview, I always tell the hiring manager that I want the job. My mom said that very few people told her that and it always left an impression. 

Hope this helps!",1
691,"I *was* the same and it took 10 years but honestly now I'm completely the opposite and you can be too. 

I learned from my mother and learned to be cruel in the worst ways to the people I love most. I consider it a gift though because now I think I'm even more compassionate and thoughtful in my communication than the average person. 

It took me a while but the only real guidance I can offer is learning to immediately acknowledge to yourself when you said something (or *how* you said something) with the intent of being hurtful. The second you recognize ""yeah, I did that just to make them react"" you can follow it up and an apology and rephrase, and then you'll slowly do it less and less, and you'll get better and better at assessing everything before it comes out of your mouth. I don't even think most people have to be *that* aware of their words (because they were never *that fucked up*) - but you will be and you'll be so grateful for it.",1

However, my mom is from a different generation and isn't as liberal as it made her sound - she's insanely jealous and holds grudges like a fucking mythical creature. So yeah, she probably also meant no threesomes.

I've since surpassed my mother in emotional maturity and now understand that you can, in fact, have a threesome with a man who loves you - provided its part of your healthy, balanced relationship that you both want. 

The crux of it is the pressuring outside of your ""consent zone"" for his sexual pleasure.",1

It’s also interesting that I stumbled across this question because my brother has been really heavy on my mind this last week. But I don’t like to vent to my mom because she can’t even say his name without balling.

My favorite memories are of visiting her apartment when I was young (before she moved in) and her saving stale bread for us to feed the ducks at the lake near where she lived. I also loved when she played her oldies music in the car whenever she would pick me up from school and she would sing along (she was tone-deaf!). And my God, did she love John Wayne. I have probably seen every movie he's ever been in because of her. She would get so excited when his movies that she didn't own would come on TV on the Turner Classic channel, almost like a schoolgirl seeing her crush. After she passed, I held onto her John Wayne coffee mug. It's sitting on my shelf with her funeral mass card. She was a firecracker and a half and I miss her so much.",1
711,"I'm very sorry for your loss :( 

My great grandma used to make the best coffee I've ever had. Our whole family would gather every sunday to get some of it. I remember, even when she had trouble getting off the bed, she would make sure we all had our coffee on Sunday morning. My family moved to a different country. She passed away a few years later and my great grandfather told us that she would always make extra coffee in case we visited. Te extraño bisabuela.",1

My paternal grandpa died 20 years ago. He lived on the other side of the country, so visits were rare. I have one specific memory of when he came out for my brother's wedding when I was 13. He took us all out to a fancy dinner and got a bit drunk. As we were leaving, I have him a hug goodbye and he whispered ""you're my favorite."" A moment later he pulled me back to whisper ""don't tell anyone."" I don't even care if he said that to everyone, it makes me smile to remember. 

My dad passed a year and a half ago. His health had been declining for over a decade, so it was a relief in the end to have him free from pain. Before he passed, though, he was able to be there to give me away at my wedding and he met and held my daughter. I have so many cheerful memories of him. He was a good man, and I miss him a lot. 

I'm so sorry for your loss. It's important to remember the moments we had with them and carry them with us into the future. As long as we carry the memories, we carry a part of them as well.",1
713,"My papa has been gone almost 16 years, but I'll never forget how kind he was. It was always little things, like sneaking extra sugar into our kool-aid because my grandma would only put a little bit in. He would give us little tasks to do and give us money for it, like we'd be peeling potatoes and he'd give us a dollar per potato. 

I had a great-aunt that I was super close with. She passed about 8 years ago. I will never forget her laugh and how much she loved to laugh. She loved to bake and would make hundreds of cookies every Christmas. I have a large family, but she knew everyone's favorite and would make a box for everyone. Near the end, she couldn't bake much anymore, but she still made my favorite cookies because I was her favorite. I miss her more than those delicious cookies. 

Finally...my dog. She passed away in March. It's silly, but she was deaf, so if I needed to wake her up, I had this stick I would gently poke her with. She would growl and then realize it was me and get this big goofy mostly toothless smile. I am convinced that there is not a dog that has lived that loved their owner as much as she loved me.",1

716,"I remember alot from my granny. Mostly how we would shell peas together as she watched her soaps and ""the judges"". The Price Is Right theme will forever be burned in my mind lol.. She also would tape church sermons with a tape recorder and listen to them later. Didn't understand it then, but as I've gotten older (I'm 28 now) I find it to be so amazing. She also gave great advice; it was always rooted in doing what was right. When I would visit her, I'd LOATHE being dragged around to all her elderly buddies' homes but the wisdom I was able to gain from such an early age!!! Didn't realize just how much of a privilege and advantage I had. She passed in 2017. I'll forever miss her. 

A friend of mine from high school who I lost touch with passed last year around February or March. No one told me so I couldn't pay my respects. My mom actually brought it up in casual conversation when I called home MONTHS after the fact. It hurt, like it cut deep because he was only maybe 3-4 years older than me. It was sudden and unsuspected, shocked the whole town because of how it happened. That memory will always remain; not being able to pay my respects. He was a fun loving guy too. Always found a way to make anyone laugh. I wear alot of caps now because he always wore caps. His smile could light up any room.",1

I still don’t know what the hell the situation was but a week after he broke it off with me for being “too busy for a relationship” after a few months of blowing off my attempts to meet up he started posting all these vague-booky statuses that was building up to announcing his new girlfriend. He was (and continued to be until I finally blocked him) the king of passive-aggressive social media posting. 

Years later he messages me as if nothing ever happened wanting to go out on a date. I wanted to yell at him “YOU fucking ended it with me!!” I’m still kinda fucked up from it. I should have blocked him straight away but I endured a couple of months of him posting things like “it’s so nice to be doing things with your special someone ;) “ after never EVER posting any status of the sort while we were together.

“Finally, you’re letting me kiss you again. You don’t really put out much”, says the guy who specifically told me I could set this at the pace I wanted and have more decision making in this relationship. 

“You’re not getting sexually harassed at work. You’re just being appreciated for looking good. Must be nice”, says the guy who has never had patients try to consistently bite his boob, get handsy with his ass, tell him how much their blood pressure is raising with you near them while their wife is out, and being told when he’s out of the room, the patient thinks about him and jacks off. All because he doesn’t like the nurses in the past that have taken care of him.

And let’s not forget that on our first official date, he complained about all the guys asking me out, saying it wasn’t decent of me to still be talking to them when they’ve done “such an unforgivable thing” but went straight ahead and told me of a disappointing date he went on the day before our date. Apparently a random girl that dropped off her number at his work counter is okay! Because it’s the first time anyone has ever done that to him! 

Whatever kind of empathy you have for someone, even if their pain is real, so is yours. You don’t have to stand for someone destroying your boundaries to help them. Don’t let a guy belittle your experiences, your decisions, ignore your boundaries, and you sure as hell don’t let him decide how pretty you are.

736,"In my experience, when people are actually averse to drama, it tends not to be something they mention because they don't really deal with a tonne of it or bother with it at all 

Hate is a passionate emotion. If you hate something that means you concern yourself with it to such an extent that it causes an emotional response from you, and typically emotional responses are followed by actions. 

So, sorry, but if you go around telling people you hate drama, what you're *really* telling them is that you can't help but get pulled into drama (or even starting it) and what you actually hate is when you end up the loser in the drama at the end. 

If you just don't engage with drama and don't announce your hate for drama, people will tend to assume that you are ambivalent to it, which is generally what most healthy individuals are looking for.",1

What an idiot I was for sticking around.",1
741,"This was something I dealt with almost 20 years ago (I'm turning 40 next week). My mother passed away from a very aggressive brain tumor, leaving her husband (my well-meaning but...problematic step-father). My biological father (whom I was still living with while I worked and went to school part time) had major mental and physical health problems of his own, and was just unable to live a functional adult life. As much as I tried, I couldn't do anything for either of them. Neither of them were were abusive, but as a young adult dealing with her own issues and trying to come into her own, I felt more and more and more like I needed distance if I had any hope of moving forward.

Ultimately, I was able to use the tiny bit of life insurance money I got from my mother's death to move out to Los Angeles with my girlfriend and try to start my adult life and career.

The emotional distance this created between me and my fathers was really unfortunate. Neither of them were together enough to keep in touch with me very much, and I was dealing with my own emotional baggage and wasn't able to either. So for the next decade it was just a phone call with my father maybe once or twice a month...and some kind of communication with my step-father once every few months (or less). I felt horrible about this, and ultimately their lives kind of spiraled into some really unhealthy places. But...again...there was nothing I could do to save them.

My father passed away from his health problems about 5 years ago. He had moved very far away, and my wife and I had to travel to the state he had lived in to pack up his belongings and wrap up all his affairs. I had never been there before. When we walked into his apartment it was just...horrid. His hording tendencies had gotten the better of him. There was filth everywhere, and his bedroom was full of old boxes...and a cat litter box with cat poop still in it even though his cat had passed away years ago. He had been sleeping on a cheap mattress on the floor in the living room next to a small TV I had bought for him...and surrounded by photos of me :(

I don't know if I'll ever not feel regret about this. My father loved me immensely, but was too unhealthy to be able to show it. Even in our infrequent communication, we had a connection that I'm still feeling the loss of. I wish I could have done more for him. But the truth is, I had mountains of traumas of my own to overcome. And only now that I'm on the cusp of 40, and with a beautiful 7 month son my wife and I adopted as a newborn, do I think I'm strong enough to be able to handle him. He just...wasn't able to live that long.

My step-father, I keep somewhat at arm's length. But I do try to keep in touch more than I did previously. He's not able to take care of himself either, but has caretakers in his siblings so I know I'll never have to face the choices with him that I did with my father.

I think, overall, I'm saying that sometimes these choices can be difficult. they might not be ""clean"". There will be regrets. You may question this stuff for the rest of your life. But, as with me, if your parents truly love you they'll understand and support you prioritizing your own health and happiness...even over theirs.",1
742,"When I was twelve years old my Nana’s boyfriend passed away. My cousin and I didn’t want her to be lonely so we decided to get her a bird. We didn’t have any money or means of transportation (as we were latchkey kids). We borrowed two ill fitted bikes and left at dawn to make enough money to buy our Nana a bird. We had decided early on that we would wash cars/windshields in order to earn enough money. We washed dozens of cars and by noon we had made $30. We then embarked on a ride across town to the Petco. When we got to the Petco the sales clerk schooled us on the realities of buying a bird, which included all the bells and whistles.  (No we didn’t factor in money for a cage, toys, treats, or food/water dishes). We realized we only had enough money for 1 parakeet and a small bag of seeds. Also we were on our bikes and there was no way we would make it home with everything in hand (My feet barely touched the pedals!). Clearly we were children that did not think this completely through. The sales clerk asked us why we wanted the bird and our story touched them. They offered to get/buy us a cage and give us a discount on the food dishes... all we had to do was give them all our cash. They agreed to drop everything off to the house after their shift. We then raced home before it got too dark and waited. Several hours had passed and we feared we had been duped, but alas a knock at the door, it was the sales clerk with TWO parakeets and all the goods!!! It felt like such an amazing adventure at the time. I still think about riding our bikes into a dust cloud kicked up by a passing semi on our way to Petco hell bent on buying Nana a parakeet.",1
743,"D e p r e s s i o n 

My life wasn't my own as much as it was one of my parent's, which meant I grew super super depressed trying to make it in that world. Of course, friends save the day, but...I was not living how I wanted to live - and that can only be hidden for a little bit before it starts leaking out in your day-to-day existence. 

My ass should've been on medication and free to *choose* what I really wanted to do, as well as aided from my divorced and narc parents. 

Being on medication now helps a lot, and the difficulties of being a high schooler then have passed a lot since then. I learned that I'm smarter than I know and so are most people, high school and teenagery is just unfair and fucked up in (American) society",1
744,"My papa’s funeral. While it was sad, he had been struggling with Alzheimer's for the last 10 years of his life. It was putting a huge strain on my nana, my dad and his siblings. When he passed away, it was like everyone could breathe again. The funeral also was like a family reunion and we reminisced about the good times in our childhoods and had lots of laughs.",1
745,"My dad's best friend passed away out of nowhere in 2015, literally a *week* after he came camping at the top of Scotland with us. So many of his lovely family members told us he had been so happy to go with us, he caught his first fish, felt a proper rainstorm when his tent collapsed and had told them all how much of a lovely time he had. I miss him now.",1
746,"One of my good friends passed away due to complications from an illness she’d had her whole life. It was simultaneously the saddest and happiest funeral I’d ever been to. She was a beautiful girl with a happy spirit, so we tried to honor her in the same way. We all wore yellow (her favorite color) to the service, brought all yellow followers, and sang her favorite songs. Her sister told funny stories about her, it was beautiful really. I think she would have liked it.",1
747,"I hope that my grandfather's funeral will be what he envisions. He says he wants a huge party. Singing, dancing, gathering passersby off of the streets, just to say goodbye. I hope to hell that he makes it through these Covid days so that he can have what he wishes for!",1
748,"My grandma just passed away in October. A few months before she died, we found her life story that she had hand written back in 1995 which chronicled her life up until that point. She made the comment that whenever she died, it would sure be nice to have someone read it at her funeral. I volunteered to do it thinking I had quite a while to prep. However the time came much too soon. I got up there and read 19 pages of her life to everyone in attendance. We laughed, we remembered, and we cried, it was the most happiest and memorable funeral I’ve ever attended.",1
749,"When my Grandma passed, rather than a funeral, we gathered in her apartment. Just the women of the family were there, and we made her famous cinnamon buns and played her country tapes and laughed and reminisced and giggled and cried. We all wore pink, which was her favorite colour.  It was perfect. She would have loved it. Miss you Grams 💖💓",1
750,"2016, when my brothers gf passed away from crohns. It was raining pretty hard that day. During the service almost everyone who went up, including my brother, told great memories that made us all laugh. My son was around 3 and while he didn't fully understand what was going on, he helped with the laughter and love that filled the room. Once the service was done, the rain let up and the the sun started to poke out from the clouds while we were at the cemetery. It really was a beautiful funeral.",1
751,"My grandma passed away a few years ago, and she always said that when she goes she just wants to be cremated and her ashes spread out at her favourite spot. I don't know how it is in other places but throwing away human ash is considered littering where I am from and is highly illegal. Usually the remains are handed out in a urn with a vacuum sealed hard plastic bag inside that goes into a wall you can visit.  Anyways, after the memorial service, around 13 of us went to Grandma's fav spot, which also happened to be a popular hiking place for people. 

My family is a very ""sharing is caring"" type, so they decided that everyone gets a turn at spreading grandma's ashes, so whenever someone turn started my mom and aunt would loudly say ""makes sure there will be enough for everyone"". In the mean time it's around -10 degrees, people are walking their dogs, there are some serious hikers nodding hello, while my cousin, last in line to spread her,  just realises that more than half of grandma is  left in the bag. It was so comical that everyone was so contemplative, saying goodbye, crying and remembering how great this woman was, and then my mom and aunt start discussing if we should just do another round of spreading her, because ""it's only fair"". 

Meanwhile,  my brother and i just started laughing hysterically because my grandma would have called us idiots for going through so much trouble, we are freezing our asses off, looking out to see if anybody has called the police/rangers, and my cousin is still pouring everything out of the bag halfway screaming: ""it's okay now, you are free, you were so small, how is this even possible??""

Then we all went home, had a beer, ending a difficult and sad  day on a happy note. It's a memory that is funny and sweet, which is so fitting to how my grandma was. Damn, I miss her so much.",1
752,"My step mom did an assisted suicide after a long battle with ALS. She had a celebration of life, we were all drinking mimosas and crying with her, it was really beautiful. She passed away with all of us around watching the sunset from her favorite spot in the house. It was sad, but so meaningful.",1
753,"My grandma and grandpa went to the same restaurant every day of the week. Except the restaurant was closed on Sundays so they went somewhere else on Wednesdays. They did this for years.

When my grandma passed away each restaurant sent flowers to the funeral home. Neither restaurant wanted to be outdone by the other so they kept sending more and more. It turned into a turf war of flowers. We couldn't stop laughing every time more flowers were delivered.

Also, a lady showed up to the wake wearing the same outfit my grandmother was wearing in the casket. My brother and I took a poll of who wore it better.",1
754,"My grandpa passed away close to Thanksgiving, but he knew he was going to pass. He asked his kids to have a memorial for him in Cinco de Mayo. He loved spending time in Mexico and my grandma was from Ensenada; she passed at a young age, but she was the love of his life. He wanted us to have a celebration of life for him and my grandma since they would finally be together again. My aunts and mom made a ton of tamales, carne asada, spanish rice, homemade refried beans, barbacoa, and lots of other mexican dishes using my grandma's recipes. My uncle hired a mariachi band and tended bar that day. There was lots of joy, laughter, reminiscing, and love. I got to see pictures of my grandma with my grandpa, him in his Marine dress uniform and her in a traditional mexican wedding dress with lace frills and a train that went on forever. We drank margaritas and danced to the mariachi music, we talked and laughed, drank and ate until we were bursting at the seams. It was a wonderful day.",1
755,"I work as a personal trainer for cancer patients. Several years ago I had a client go down hill very quickly. I saw her in the hospital a week before she passed. She knew I loved high heels, so she made me promise to wear my tallest sexiest heels to her funeral. I honored her wish and at her very religious, Christian funeral I wore shiny black very sexy open toed 5” heels. I could almost hear her chuckling at me. I still miss her.",1
756,"My friends mom passed away right before our senior year in high school. It was incredibly sad, she was really young (heart complications) and we were all upset at the funeral. Their house was always where we went to hang out. Her parents let us sleep over and have a few parties and stuff. (Not like ragers or anything but like 5 or 6 of us at a time)

Anyway, we had tons of memories at the funeral. We had a lot of fun there. The kids and friends mostly stayed outside so we weren’t actually disrupting the grieving but we still talk about that day a lot and I know her mom wouldn’t have cared. I miss that woman a lot.",1
757,"Probably my MIL a few years ago. She had a really long journey with cancer: she had undergone another round of chemo and radiation  she was told she was 'in the clear' by her doctors, and passed about 6 months later. Her passing was incredibly difficult on my husband and our extended family. Especially as she decided to pass at home where she was more comfortable (with a few equipment rentals). 

Their family is SUPER Catholic (not a judgement, just a fact) and you could see how much peace the ability to convene and pray as a community helped start the grieving process. My husband delivered her eulogy and helping him prepare for it was cathartic for certain. One of the uncles hosted a small get together following the service and we ended up sitting in the sun, drinking margaritas (mom's celebratory drink of choice) and sharing stories.",1
758,"My great-aunt died a few years ago, her quality of life was almost non-existent at the end. When I heard about her death, I was relieved. My grandma's cat died a few weeks before, I had more tears for her than for my great-aunt.

She taught piano to many children in her village and she wasn't a very nice teacher. 6 people at her funeral altogether, including 4 family members who ""had"" to be there.

The pastor mispronounced her name a few times. He told us of her good nature and her helpfulness. We giggled all the way through. The meal afterwards was a celebration. When our hostess came to tell us her sympathies and we told her who died, she couldn't hold back her grin.

You see, my great-aunt used to beat each and every last one of her pupils, my mum included, but everyone in town wanted for their child to be a musician or at least play one instrument, so they sent their kids to her. Also, beating a child was permitted then (it isn't now). Since she died in her late 80s and not much of that generation is left in town, everyone hated her. I think some of them danced on her grave. She was a miserable old woman who liked making others miserable as well.",1

The hospital staff emptied his pockets and his wallet was one of the personal items they gave back to us.  In that wallet, are his bus tickets, his license, cash and the worn-out paper with our cell phone numbers written on them.

Months before the pandemic, I had taken a trip to the local library where they had new, used and old library books half off what they usually sell them for. One was a new book I got because I had read a book by the same author and the other was a book I hadn't seen in a long time. It was a book called ""Storybound"" and it was a book I read in middle school about a girl who gets transported to a world of fairy tales. It was the first of two books, but the first book was the only one I read and the only one there so I bought it. I've read it a few times for nostalgia, but I bought it to add to my collection of books I want to pass down to my kids. Right with my other old books from middle and elementary school.",1

So I prepared by spending as much time with him as possible, and asking him all sorts of questions about his life etc. He passed away from cancer when I was 19, and I had alot of closure because i grew up living like this.

But there is always going to be the one more question or one more moment you wish you could have. It's always small things like, I'll remember a memory he told me, but now I want to know the finer details like what year was that, what else happened etc....or I'll have a dream of him, and I'll go to hug him but I'll wake up. Its moments like that my heart hurts but I'm just super grateful I got to know my Dad.",1

I'm sure he knew but it would have been nice for him to hear it.

My dad was never one to be in photos. I only have a handful of them between my high school graduation and his passing 6 years later, one of which is from my grandmother's funeral. I'd love to have more pictures of and with him. 


Because my parents had been divorced for a few years at that time, I also wish we would have known where his important info was as a general precaution. Bank accounts, life insurance, cash, mortgage info, etc. was not easy to find and that's a big deal when someone is gone unexpectedly.",1

He was a lazy, dumb cat (the best kind) who didn't mind being carried around or dressed in doll clothes.  He slept in my crib when I was a baby, and continued to sleep in my bed every night.  When he got too old and sick to jump into bed, I slept on the floor with him.",1
773,He was a guinea pig. He was mostly very shy. He passed away because he got out once and spent the whole time eating my plastic dollhouse. :(,1
774,"That sounds like a great way to get somebody's passwort security question ;) 

But seriously: we had a female abyssinian guinea pig in caramel and white. I know you're not supposed to keep them singular but I was seven or eight and my mom said so. She was allowed to roam the apartment freely all day and would come to the sofa to lick our feet. However, she would only walk on carpet because she didn't like how her little feet slipped on hardwood floors.

When she wasn't even a year old, my dad stepped on her. My mom rushed her to the vet, while my dad stayed home feeling immensely guilty. She broke her hip but the vet said she'd make it. And she did and died at the ripe age of nine years. Which is rather old for guinea pigs. 

She was a good pig and had all of the cute habits – whistling when she heard us using the salad dryer and answering with a deep sound when we slapped our thighs. She also loved cucumber peels and parsley. She especially loved eating the fringes of our parents' persian rugs. My mom tried to stop her, rubbing them in perfume samples. But when it wore off, she'd be back at it again.",1
775,"Trigger Warning (TW): I will mention medical infections, operations and pet passing. It's quite a sad story, honestly.

My first pet was a Persian cat. He was such a wonderful and quiet animal. He did not need to talk nor make a sound, his presence was calming enough. I loved him with my entire being. I'll always say he used all of his 7 lives and did not waste a single one. He lost an eye when he was young because of an infection. Then a year before his passing, he was staying with my grandma while we were on vacation, he got disoriented and fell from a window, four floors onto the ground. Luckily the only thing he broke were his front paws. 

He accompanied me during most of my school years, high school and during my senior years. Sadly, we had to put him down because when he fell, he probably also hit his chin onto the ground, which caused him to get one of his tooth so infected it literally started eating him from inside out. As he was really old and weak we could not operate him because the chances of him passing on the operation table were very high. The only thing we could do is let him live as much as he wanted to live.

I remember begging him when he was already weak to survive to see me get into my dream college, and he did. He lived for seven more months when his life expectancy was two weeks max. The same day we put him down I got the results of my university entry exam. I got in. 

I still miss him everyday. But he taught me many valuable lessons and helped me get through very hard times mentally and I will be forever thankful.",1
776,"My first pet outside of family pets was my dog Kelsie. She was a shih tzu/poodle. Sadly, she passed away a little under a year ago. 

She was such a great little dog with a huge personality. She was a yappy little thing and did not like strangers, but man did that dog love me. Kelsie was deaf for the latter half of her life. She also survived cancer at the young age of 7. She absolutely loved cats. When we brought our kitten home, she would cry if the kitten wasn't in her sight. She also really loved kids, especially one of my nieces and my son. 

She was there with me when I had my kid, during my worst breakup, and stuck around just long enough for me to get married. She was there to cuddle away any sadness. If I cried, she would immediately jump on my lap and comfort me. The night before she died, she was having trouble walking. She could barely get out of her bed, but she got up so she could find a spot to stare at me. She just laid there and stared at me for a couple hours. I think she knew her time was up, even if I didn't know it at the time. 

I miss her so much.",1

778,"It was a couple of years ago, at Christmas. We were all gathered at my parents' house. For some reason I just couldn't sleep, so I got up and wandered downstairs to find my brother still up as well, wrapping presents for his daughter at like 2 am. I sat down and helped him out. Then we watched Mom and Dad Save The Planet and Jingle All The Way. At one point we were both hungry, so he got up and made us waffles with peanut butter and syrup. We just sat and laughed and smoked outside, just the two of us, enjoying each other's company in the tiny hours of Christmas morning, waiting for everyone else to get up.

He passed away 18 months ago. So that memory is even more precious to me, and when I'm truly missing him I make myself remember when we sat on the couch together, holding the plate of santa cookies and arguing over which of us would be able to take the most perfect bite of a cookie so my niece would know that santa had enjoyed them.",1
779,"One night I was tucking my brother (7) and my sister (4) into bed and reading them a bedtime story. I'm 23 and live away for college so always made a point of tucking them in when I was home.

I was wedged between the two of them in their bed after finishing a story (they slept together every night), my little sister rolled over and fell asleep. When we realised she was asleep, my brother and I gave each other a knowing glance, turned to each other and started cuddling, limbs intertwined. We both said 'I love you', and he just looked at me with the most beautiful expression I have ever seen, with complete and utter love and happiness. He cupped my face with his little hands and I rubbed his back.

I'll never forget how I felt at that moment. Two months later he passed away in his sleep, unexpectedly. He was my best friend and showed me the true meaning of love. It will always be the most precious moment in my life.",1
780,"man my precious memories stem from dark places. let's see.... well one was like 4 years ago. I was laying in bed having a really bad day with my depression not able to get out of bed. My SO insisted I just lay there and not worry about a thing and just left me alone and took over with the kids. My son who was almost three at the time managed to get pass her. He waddled his way to my room and asked what was wrong. Told him nothing was wrong mommy just felt really really sad and just needed to get some sleep. He looked around and found one of his starter books on my floor from when I read to him the other night and picked it up and crawled into bed with me and say. ""K well i read mommy story for bed time."" He then made sure I was tucked in and cuddled up and read me a story before giving me a kiss on the head and getting caught in the room by my SO. I explained he was reading mommy a story for nap time and she hauled him off telling him to let her now before he runs off like that again. Then got him excited to watch my little pony with his sister with the promise he could watch team umi zoomi or blippi after. it really put into perspective how important little things like his bedtime routine was to him and how it made him feel and how special it was to him.",1
781,"When I just graduated high school my parents filed bankruptcy and we lost everything. We had to move from our big house in a nice neighborhood to a small one bedroom apartment next to a strip club. We lost our two cars and had to take the bus everywhere. A family of 7 sharing a 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom, with a kitchen so small you could put you hands on either wall, you would think this would be awful but it was the best 2 years in my families' life. We smiled and laughed all the time, we were grateful that we even had a place and that we were together. The engery in that small little apartment was so positive we even had friends ask to stay the night and more with us. We took turns sleeping in the bed, I slept in the closet most of the time. 

We had lost everything but having all those material things kept us apart. Losing it brought us closer together. To this day, I pass that little apartment on my way to my condo on the beach, I look at it and smile, grateful they haven't torn it down yet. The strip club was torn down by the way. Since then I've lost my mom to cancer, my dad to illness, and my sister to drugs but I still have those 2 years ingrained in my memory.",1

They picked me up from day care with their bikes, cooked me lunch, played with me, watched TV, took me on walkes with our dog, tucked me in at night when my parents were out. When I went off to university I hopped on a two hour long train ride to visit them every weekend. And when they passed away it was the worst pain I had and have ever felt. 

I promised to visit their grave as often as possible, and I do. I live on a different continent now, but I try to be there multiple times a year. I also keep in contact with their siblings and I have their pictures and wedding bands. Thinking about getting a tattoo to honor them.",1

Regardless, my grandpa and I had a good relationship as we bonded over sports and the dream that I’d study in Japan. My grandma and I are closest as we bonded over lots of things such as cooking and baking, comedies, art, and more. She’s a very gentle and patient soul that never fails to cheer me up with her good company and yummy food. Although she also wants me to come study in Japan so she’s been urging me to pick up Japanese lately😅

My grandparent’s on my dad’s side are from the States and have both passed long ago. I never got to meet my grandfather since he passed before I was born but I’ve heard a lot about him and really admire him. My grandmother was a very kind and quick-witted woman who taught me a lot. She also always had the best games (video games/sports/etc), answers to my many questions, bandages to patch me up, my favorite cereals stocked up, and a witty comeback for anyone and everyone.

I miss them a lot but I’ll be sure to make many more good memories with my grandma!!😁",1

790,"Basically non existent

My paternal grandparents loved me,  but were too poor and sick to visit me,  and we couldn't afford to visit them.  They wrote me letters, and I got to see them in person 3 or 4 times in my life before they died when I was a teen.  I really enjoyed my time with them,  but I don't have many memories.  I wish I could have gotten to know them.  

My maternal grandparents apparently had no interest in me whatsoever. I don't remember them ever making an effort to visit me,  have me visit them,  write to me,  call me.  That was especially sad,  because they both lived into my mid thirties,  so I lost a lot of time in a different way.  I remember hearing my grandmother had passed,  and my first thought was how inconvenient it was going to be to attend her funeral. Which is awful. But she was a stranger to me.  

An elderly widower lived across the street from me when I was a kid.  He had no grandchildren of his own,  and he adopted me and my siblings.  He accompanied me to my school's annual grandparents luncheon,  which I had never been able to attend before.  He brought me flowers.  He never forgot my birthday. He walked me home from school when he was feeling up to it. He died at the age of 102. I got to be with him. He was my real grandfather.

792,"Two of my grandparents passed before I was born, but the remaining two are/were polar opposites (my grandfather passed a few years ago).

My grandfather loved me to pieces; it was no secret that I was the favorite grandchild (and he didn't have many). He loved hearing my stories, seeing my art projects, laughed when I loudly blurted out an opinion, watched movies/TV with me just to see what my world was. I was 11 the last time I saw him, and then his health started failing and his wife (not my grandmother) went out of her way to distance him from my family. He was not the nicest of people- but he loved me, so my relationship with him and memories are very complex. He passed while I was in college and I couldn't get time off work to go to the funeral; I am furious at him for some things he used to say to my mom, but I'm also a little sad that he never got to see me graduate from college or meet my BF. It was complex. But I know he loved me.

My grandma, on the other hand, is still alive. And hates me. Mostly because I am my mother's daughter and she hates my mom for the simple reason that is: My mom is not Catholic. Yeah. It's ah... A very weird thing, especially since my mom and I are Christian's, just not of the Catholic variety (before someone comes at me and asks did we do anything to insult her, no- my grandma tried to insist that my mom convert when my parents first got married, she said no, and for that my grandma has always hated her). So, I've been called an illegitimate child to my face and it used to really upset me. Doesn't anymore but it was hella annoying for a while. Oh, and she swears she's also the reincarnation of a holy figure in the Catholic church and gets very upset when people question her about that. Doesn't help also that while she despises me and calls me every insult in the book, she adores my sister and they have so much fun together.",1
793,"My mom's father died when I was 11 years old. Before that we had a pretty good relationship with them. After the death my already strange and cold grandma turned even colder. I don't have a need to stay in touch with her and she is not interested in my life either.

With my father's side I had a rather formal relationship. We visited there every two months. But my mother kept telling all this bs about them all the time so I was afraid as a child to trust them or have a close relationship. 

Later in teenage I realised the problem was my mother, not other people. I started bonding more with my father's mother. My father's father was a man of few words so we didn't talk much. But he was ok. He passed away in an accident last year. I keep in touch with my father's mother every once in a while. I live in another country now so we send messages on whatsapp. We are not super close but she is supportive and I sense she wants the best for us. Even though sometimes she's expecting too much.

Overall grandparents or relatives are not that important for me. My mom made sure to spoil every relationship we had to her side of family. And my father's side is just very... restrained I guess?",1
794,"I think this anecdote counts.

I was at the grocery store at the busiest time. This man in his 50's was blocking the path and kind of walking backwards while he said hi a friend over his shoulder. I said, ""Excuse me,"" because I couldn't get past him. It was loud enough for him to hear, but he ignored me. So I shouldered my way past him. After I passed, he said, ""mumble-mumble-mumble, ya cold ass bitch!"" By the time it registered what he'd said I was an aisle and a half away. I spun around and said, ""HEY! I said 'excuse me,' but *you* didn't move! That's no reason to call me a BITCH!""

 Like I said, it was the busiest time, so 10-15 people witnessed that interaction. He didn't say anything more (what could he say?) and I went about my shopping.",1
795,"5 Years later he messaged me and apologized for everything. I can tell he wants to prove to me he's changed but, so many years have passed. I don't have the same taste, I have no feelings for him anymore. Didn't open old wounds, it was healing knowing that I know I'd never be with him again lmao",1
796,"Yes. We had met up six months after the breakup. It was my first time seeing him in person. He wanted to say goodbye because he was moving across the country. (California). A lot inside of me thought he were going to eventually get back together. We spent three hours at the restaurant catching up. In the end I broke down crying saying I was scared I’d never find someone I’d love as much as him and he kind of reassured me before making a cocky ass statement about how he set the bar really high and how it probably would be hard for me. The sad part is that I believed him. I kept some contact in some sick way of still wanting to be apart of his life. It wasn’t healthy for me in any way. And I did a lot of the reaching out and him gently ignoring me. 

Eventually (ONE AND A HALF YEARS LATER) I moved on. Blocked him. And didn’t say anything else on my way out. About a year after I unblocked him. He actually reached out to me two months ago (it’s been over three years now) and I got a quick whiff of why I was okay with moving on. 

He was a really cocky dude. A lot of the “catching up” was his way to display how amazing his life is and how he’s doing. There was a lot of emphasis on that which makes me feel like if you have to emphasize that, then you’re probably not having a good time lol. 

I kind of just let him speak and then he ended the conversation with him going to bed (I barely got a three words in) lol. But that’s about it. deep down I still feel a sting of betrayal. But I think about what my brother told me in the midst of this chaotic breakup, that you’ll always love that person deep down and that the feeling of being hurt is always there but with time you’ll learn how to cope and manage the hurt better. (Ironically my brother passed away two years ago and now I use this advice towards him)

I’m a million times better. No contact is the hardest but best way to go. 

So yea. Crazy times 😂

12/10 would not do that again lol",1

My one good friend in the area who lives alone and is taking COVID as seriously as I am and I have gone on a few hikes, which is nice to get out of the house. The thing I'm really missing is more surface level/passive interactions, like sitting in a coffee shop or even playing sports. They can wait, though.  


I've also taken up a few new hobbies and improved my cooking skills. I can knit now and make a damn good vegan carbonara.

I suppose it would bother me if it happened in public, or now that we have a child if it happened where he could hear it - though my husband is the quiet angry type, so no personal experience with that.

I can’t say I get why people are so up in arms about this (traumatic experiences exempted), I’ll take a yeller over passive aggression any day of the week. But that’s just me 🤷🏻‍♀️",1
809,"I don't think it's an inherently less mature to yell vs to entirely shut down (I personally am less bothered by yellers because shutting down feels like a weird power flex to me in which they have sole control over whether the issue is going to be solved). Both are emotional regressions that frankly everyone is entitled to once and a while as reactions to pain, grief, bad situations, etc.

Anger is a human emotion and it's very weird to say that experiencing it is wrong or bad or try to police how other people feel pain. I think it's extremely inappropriate that people pass judgments on other's intelligence based on how they react to pain-if their reaction is harmful to you, it's on you to leave the situation-and that goes for any reaction.  


If someone is screaming at a coworker for like misplacing a pen, yeah that's inappropriate to the situation and not great (although I'd say most of the time that's not the problem and there's something else going on there).",1

For those that yell immediately over the silliest stuff like something dropping by accident, or someone asking whats wrong and gets an aggressive response to hell with those types because they piss me off the most. If they do it consistently its verbal abuse to me at that point. I keep my distance with these types of people because if I blow up right back I don't feel that great about it. Almost want to fight that person, to avoid that feeling I might give my two thoughts and hurry up and go to a different location space to calm down.

I have a memorial plaque in my house. Whenever a pet passes away, I write their name on it. It's prominently displayed, so every time I walk by it, I tend to see at least one name. And then I force myself to remember a good memory of them.

I also sometimes go back through old photos, if they're available. Unfortunately for awhile there I was really bad at taking pictures, so I don't have many, but I can still look back through the ones I have and smile as I remember how cute/funny/affectionate they were. 

Also, when I feel the time is there, I'll start looking for a new baby. The loss of a pet is always terrible, but I like to think of it as making room in my home for another pet who deserves a forever home as well. Not a replacement, nothing can ever replace a beloved pet, but there's now space for another member of my silly furry family.",1
817,"I absolutely fell apart for a good 6 months after one of my cats passed back in 2018. Probably took a full year to completely recover. He was my emotional support animal and we'd bonded incredibly strongly, plus he was my first cat.

818,"Don't really have anything to add because the only time I had a pet was when I was very young, and I don't have too many memories about him (he was a dog, and died pretty soon).

But... I grieve a lot about cherished pets from my friends that end up passing away. Somehow, I feel very attached to them, and when my friends end up telling me that something came to happen to their pets, I can't help but feel terribly filled with sadness.

I remember this cat (he was called Fred) that my friend would always take pictures of to show me. He didn't have a home apparently, so my friend took him in. The kitty was just so cute, always with a sleepy face on, barely open eyes, and he had huge, adorable paws. I soon felt like he was my own cat. And one day when I heard that he got hit by a car and died... I got so sad, powerless, but also very mad with my friend for letting him out in the streets. The thought of never seeing him again, even though I didn't interact with him too much, in a way made me feel like I had lost something very important to me. I wanted so much to shout ""why didn't you take better care of him?!""

It probably can't compare to having lived with a pet for more than 10 years like some people do, but I guess my love for animals and their different personalities is one of the most genuine feelings I've experienced. And if I did have a pet... I can't even imagine how much I'd cry if they died, lol.",1
819,"I also got kittens, about 9 months after my first cat passed away (I adopted him when he was six and he lived to be 21, so I had a lot of time with him). 

I live by myself and besides missing him I suddenly had to deal with living in a truly empty home and I totally needed more cat energy in my life, but it took a good 6 months before that didn't feel like 'betraying' my old cat.",1

He would never approve my hair (I’ll never go back to long hair), coloring my hair (let alone multiple times), how I am not straight (pansexual, and usually more attracted to women- I’m a woman), or even being able to go out late with friends. I don’t even know if he would’ve liked to find out I got a boyfriend in junior year- he was so protective and joked in ways to where he might have gotten a bad impression on my then boyfriend. Apparently, he was more racist, anti lgbtq+, bad republic, and sexist than I knew- but since he died before I went to high school when I branched out, I never got to discover him like that. I can see myself arguing with him about this stuff, and the ONLY time I thought perhaps it was better he passed at that time? I am so happy how I can be myself now, and I would not change that for the world.. and can’t help but wonder how sad I’d be if he happened to be alive now and probably restricted how I could be myself.

That sounds like nothing, but I spent the next month and a half bedridden, in agony (a genuine 10 on the scale for me). I couldn't sleep, move, sit for more than 10 minutes, I was stiff all the time. I still had to go out, still had chores and jobs to do, but simply struggled with everything.

It's not just that certain movements caused pain. There was a baseline pain there 24/7, if I triggered that extra pain from movement or even just sitting/standing without moving too long I ended up in so much pain I literally passed out. 

If I sat for too long my lower back and legs went numb. My thighs would ache, I got cramps in my legs. My arms hurt from having to use them to lug my body around. I once got stuck to the floor and basically just had to lay on my back sleeping there until it calmed down enough to try and move again.

Then randomly, one morning I woke up and it was all back to normal. 

Back injuries run in the family, my mum and gran had similar problems, my mum actually had some of her spine operated on to try and fix some of her problems.

838,"I had been renting a townhouse for years from a private owner. Stuff had been left in the backyard. (Weathered/ broken umbrella, weathered chairs, a rusty 'portable' rod iron fire pit)

I finally got permission to get rid of the stuff. Most of it was easy to break down and dispose of. But that stupid fire pit was heavy AF and hard to move on the uneven tile that was on the patio. 

One summer night, I had a drink or two, was out back smoking just glaring at this ugly thing and finally had enough. I figured if I could get it to the wall, I could find a way to leverage it over the wall. Since I lived in the corner of my street, the dumpsters were close, so I could drag it the rest of the way.  (I didn't want to take it through my house. It was filthy, rusty, super gross)

So I was pushing and pulling this stupid thing, sweating bc even at 8pm it was still like 98*F outside. I was so close to my backyard patio wall when it got stuck in the grout indentation of tile. So I took a deep breath and pushed with all my strength, but my right hand slipped. I fell forward and one of the rusty rod iron bars when straight through my arm, from the base my palm, up past my wrist. 

I did what I medically know you shouldn't do, I pulled my arm up and ripped it away from the bar. 

Went to my bathroom, realized it was bleeding really bad, grabbed a hand towel and tried to apply pressure. The rest is pretty fuzzy, but I know I called 911 (blood on my phone and conversation length noted in my phone history)

I guess I told the operator I would open the front door, bc it was unlocked and open when they found me passed out on my bathroom floor(I never used my front door- garage was attached,  so I had to have gotten up and opened it which is probably what made me pass out). Once I passed out, obviously pressure was no longer being applied, so I was quickly bleeding out. Luckily I lived within a few blocks of the hospital. 

I vaguely remember the paramedics and ER. I remember my OP nurse who was super sweet to me, talking about how much she liked my Alice in Wonderland tattoos(such a random flash of a memory), before I was rolled into emergency surgery. And then I was out until 2 days later. 

I had blood transfusions, apparently my surgery took over 6 hours and a few different drs in there working on me. 

I have permanent damage. The bottom part of my palm is numb 24/7. I have constant pain near the tendon that was repaired. Plus a gross scar.

849,"If you already know some of this stuff, my apologies for over-explaining: 

The US government is split into three branches Executive (the president), Legislative (Congress = House + Senate), and Judicial (Supreme Court). Each of these branches are designed to essentially have equal power as part of our checks and balances system. 

Therefore, the Supreme Court has the power to overturn any US law and any executive order passed by the president if they find grounds to do so based on the US constitution. They can also reverse uno card it and overturn any previous Supreme Court rulings.

The court consists of 9 ""Justices"" that must be nominated by the president and then confirmed through a vote in the US Senate. Justices have lifetime tenure, which was meant as another power check, intending to make them more impartial since they wouldn't have to worry about losing their seat due to an unpopular decision. 

However, this lifetime tenure also becomes a power play, because if a Justice vacates their seat (by retiring or dying), whoever is in power at the time gets to pick the next one, and then that person is in there for life, influencing policy decisions for decades afterwards. Right now, 3 Justices in the court were appointed by George W Bush, 1 was appointed by Clinton, 2 were appointed by Obama, and since Trump's presidency he has appointed 2. Now, since Ginsburg (who was appointed by Clinton) has passed away, he's about to get a third, essentially giving the Court a Conservative majority 6-3. 

This is frightening to people because many important progressive US laws (gay marriage, abortion, etc) were upheld by landmark Court rulings that could now potentially be overturned. It also means that currently, all three branches of US government are Conservative by majority. People are also angry because the last time a seat was vacated was 2016 during Obama's presidency, and the Republican-majority Senate refused to confirm Obama's nomination using the excuse of ""it's inappropriate to confirm a Justice during an election year,"" when the election was 11 months out. Now, the Republican-majority Senate is saying ""It's fine to confirm a Justice during an election year,"" while the election is 50 days away.

Besides all that mess, Ginsburg herself was a beloved icon in US culture for being a trailblazer for women in Law from the 1960s onward and overcame sexist discrimination to reach the absolute pinnacle. She was a defender of civil liberties, challenged sexist policy, and helped uphold progressive policymaking in the US. The movie On the Basis of Sex was made about her. She will be missed.",1
850,"I am a liberal freak, and have been planning a move to Europe for some years anyhow (pre Trump), but truly no politician should be a holy beacon. As much I wanted Sanders to win the nomination, I was upset that a rather large number didn't vote- not even by mail. What happened? Not even my best friend did, who claimed to support him as well- but didn't bother to vote. If she had time to be on IG she had time to vote.

I am currently back in my hometown with my family because of COVID-19, and the county is rather conservative- much to the disadvantage of my small, migrant, left-leaning town. Even with a trickle of slightly more progressive policies passing in recent years, you still can't even drink the water here. And no Supreme Court Justice made that possible, if anything, her death has further fueled my wish for term limits of Justices- regardless of whether she was more aligned politically with me or not.",1

I also do all the other stuff like visit the library, call friends, volunteer, join community clubs.  

In the last few years I have really crossed the line between solitude and lonliness.   I hope I can get back to solitude, but I've found for lonliness there is no way to keep it away, I have just learned to spend my day with it.  So, these activities do not stop the lonliness for me, they just give me something to do while being lonely.",1

The second was a bit different. I woke up and it was weird to pee. Like there was a bit of a blockage and I had to really push it out. Then not too much time later I got the pain again in the same spot but it started worse. I had a bad feeling so I hopped in the shower really quick. By the time I got out I was doubled over again and went straight to the ER. 

Mine were both very small and passed relatively easy after getting to the hospital and getting some pain meds. Sorry if you’re going through this. I honestly felt this was more painful than birth.",1

872,"In the first week of May, when my government finally announced that they would arrange flights to take their citizens home. 
I spent half of March and all of April living in an almost apocalyptic scene- first all my flatmates moved out, just disappeared on me as they caught last minute flights back home. I live in student halls with mostly international students, so everyday I would hear atleast 3 students drag their suitcases away right below my window, and leave for their respective houses.

I felt like the last person alive. I would just sit by myself in my room all day waiting for when I'd get to go home. In retrospect, there was no serious emergency, but the pandemic made me feel like I would never see my family again. 

The day I finally got the news that I could go back home, I literally burst out crying. I have never cried that way before. It's how you see people crying when someone they know passes away. It was half scream and half cry. I swear, if my flatmates were still around and heard it, they would have freaked the fuck out. 

I made it home safely. I've spent 3 months here with my family and it was very healing. Now I'm going back in a couple weeks.",1

Of course then, at a point when both of my trainees are doing other work and are not nearby, and when I had recently just passed a corner (to literally do a task for my job), I hear my general manager shit talk us to the other employees, wondering how there were 3 of us, but no one to be found. I promptly went to the bathroom and rage and stress sobbed for what had to be something around 20 minutes.

889,"My mother passed away right after I graduated college and got married ( I was 24). My father passed away soon after and it was very... Traumatic. I was 27. As an only child, these were my best friends and it seemed impossible to keep relationships that I had, make new ones, etc.

I went through a lot of mixed emotions, obviously depression, but I became very angry and would lash out at people. I was angry because I felt life wasn't fair and I suddenly had this awakening to how cruel the world was. I had night terrors constantly, I had issues seeing blood, hearing screaming, etc. They sent me into a panic.

I was diagnosed with PTSD and sought therapy. After a year, I'm significantly better than I was. I still yearn for conversations with my parents. They bless me with talks in my dreams but I run a business and it would be nice to show them what I've accomplished. I miss their phone calls. When I'm sick, I miss their cooking and care. There are a lot of small details I miss and yearn for but I find myself trying to make new memories with my husband and friends.

I find that tradition was a large part of my childhood and the memories associated with my parents so I'm trying to create new ones to look forward to. I'm not forgetting my parents, but rather, I've read that chapter and now I'm opening the next.",1
890,"Kept with the day to day, it's really all you can do. My dad was killed in an accident right after I turned 20 and my mom died suddenly due to a heart attack 3 years ago.

You are never the same. It has honestly impacted every single facet of my life",1
891,"Right, so I was really close to my mum. Only child of a single parent. Losing her was really hard. After that, in the space of about 3 years I moved jobs twice, relocated across the country twice and got married. I also distanced myself from some relatives who were very bad to my mum, but whom my mum had wanted me to keep in my life whilst she was still alive (complicated). All very interlinked.

Specifically to deal with losing my mum, I went on anti-depressants for about a year and did two spells in therapy. The first was after a year and it was specific grief counselling. I had a great therapist, fantastic rapport and it helped a lot. I couldn’t have done it right away though, it was too raw.   


I also had some therapy soon after the grief counselling, to help me deal with my parent’s divorce, which was long and messy, and my subsequent attitude to dating/relationships. I’d parked a lot of it in adolescence, but losing my mum brought a lot of that stuff back up. The therapist was pretty good, had an ok but not great connection with them. It helped some but it was a bit of a dead end.

My dad died a few years later. Wasn’t close to him- very limited contact since childhood. Messy circumstances with step-family around the time of his passing. Went to grief counselling again very briefly. Most of the things that arose were to do with my parent’s divorce again, so worked through those myself with the help of,a,friend with a similar background. That helped as much as anything is going to help.

It’s been over 10 years now since my mum died. At about the seven year mark I started to remember things with real joy rather than through a lens of pain. I think this took longer for me than it often because I looked after her in the terminal stages of breast cancer and I probably had some form of PTSD from that. But PTSD awareness wasn’t the same 10 years ago as it is now.

It really helped me to do a few things. Firstly, light a candle for her every evening in the run up to Christmas and for a while after. Secondly, to keep buying a gift for her birthday and at Christmas. Something she would have liked.

Finally, making a gift in her memory to the local art gallery. She was an artist and also a teacher (literature rather than art). So the gift was directed towards community art programmes that reach out to kids and vulnerable people. There’s a little plaque on a wall I can go and visit when I miss her. It wasn’t a huge gift or anything, they’re just thoughtful like that.",1
892,"Mom passed away 10 years ago. I fell to pieces with grief for a bit, and I know she'd hate that. I also got a graduate degree, established a career, bought a house, and a few other things that I think she'd be proud of.",1
893,"Tried to make my mum proud, honestly. My mum passed away when i was 14 (am now 23) and it was really tough. She had cancer from when I was 7, so most of my memories are of her being sick in some way or another as she went into remission twice but it came back. My dad was heartbroken so while he tried his best, he wasnt really there for me and we quickly developed into a flatmate situation more than parent/child where he would work and do laundry, but i would make dinner and clear up after. 

I was exceptionally lucky in having an amazing partner, who had unfortunately lost his mum not long beforehand. We had started dating a couple of months before my mum passed, and she loved him to bits too which was awesome, and we're still together. If it weren't for him, i'd be in a much worse situation cos i started self harming and that was when my depression/anxiety started to kick in. 

So I focused on my studies in getting into college, then uni and now a full time job in something vaguely related to my degree. It gets easier over time as, like someone else said, you start to be able to look back at the good times and acknowledge the bad for what they were. I kept looking forward and try not to look back too often as its still quite painful. But life goes on and they'd want you to be happy",1

895,"After my dad and mom passed away within 2 years of each other, almost 11 years ago, I needed space, a lot of it, just to be by myself for a while. 

I still need those, and I have days where I wanted to sleep all day. I made myself get out of bed and get on with my life just to keep up appearances, especially during Thanksgiving and Christmas. 

I had to do the usual day to day routine to survive, to keep myself occupied, just so I wouldn’t feel sad, but it wasn’t that successful. There are days when out of nowhere I would cry my eyes out, and times when I just want to be left alone. 

My grandpa passed away a month and a half ago, and while it was expected, as he was suffering from dementia, it still hurts. I’m managing all I can for now, day by day. Writing has been my therapy, as it has helped me so much. Also, talking to my sister, my aunt, and my cousins has helped things be less painful.  

I’m managing, but I know now that I don’t have to do it alone.",1
896,"My dad passed away when I was 18. We were never insanely close, but he was a great dad and super fun to be around. His death was very sudden (heart attack), so I guess that was what messed me up the most.

In the hours after his death, I did nothing. I didn't even cry. Then I broke down. Then I got into business mode. Wanted to go get the death certificate, fix everything for everyone who went to the funeral, support my mom and sister, etc.

Then I moved back to where I was living (I was 1000 miles away studying but was visiting when it happened), tried to go back to my normal student life, managed to do it for maybe a week, and stopped attending classes. I started having a lot of issues, pains in random places, shivers, feeling like warm water would run down parts of my body when I wasn't even sweaty. Looked for doctors, got diagnosed with a condition that is basically inflammation of the center of your ribcage (reason why I always had ""heart pain""), treated that, and ultimately ended up seeing a psychiatrist because I had not grieved and my mind was causing at least 90% of my ailments. Antidepressants helped a lot, then I found a job and moved on with my life.

It's been many years, but every time I visit I still expect to see him there, and I still catch myself speaking of him as if he's still alive. It was not easy, and becoming completely functional again took me 2-3 years. 

Tl;dr it was a very sudden death, and it messed me up emotionally and physically, then was able to ""move on"" after a few years. Some days I miss him so much I cry.",1
897,Thank you for your prayers. I wish the best for your family. You are amazing to take care of your sister like that. I wish I did more for my mom. I have a lot of regret that I didn't tell her things before she passed away. It's definitely hard during the holidays.,1
898,Same here. I'm 27 and I feel so lucky I still have both my parents but I feel like there's a high chance I'm gonna lose my shit when my mom passes. I'll be equally as devastated about my dad but even thinking of losing my mom makes me wanna cry.,1

901," I'd like to add that the Bechdel test is meant to illustrate how little representation women are given in popular media. It's a condemnation of films as a genre, not meant to be used as a measure of an individual work's representation of women. 


 I think the [Mako Mori test](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Mako_Mori_test) does a better job of judging how women are portrayed in a specific piece.  To pass the test, there needs to be:

a) at least one female character;

b) who gets her own narrative arc; 

c) that is not about supporting a man’s story.",1
902,"Copy pasting from [this article](https://www.the-unedit.com/posts/2018/8/20/7-tests-that-arent-the-bechdel-test-that-measure-movies-for-gender-equality-and-representation)

The DuVernay test: 
Coined as the Bechdel Test for race, to pass the DuVernay Test, an African American character — or a character of another minority — must have ‘fully realised’ lives, with their own desires, rather than serving as background characters (see: the black friend) for white plotlines.

The Waithe Test: 
Founded by: Lena Waithe
Waithe’s criteria focuses solely on the representation of the black woman, a character which is all too often stereotyped. To pass the Waithe Test, the film has to feature a black woman who exists within a position of power and is in a healthy relationship.

The Villalobos test:
Founded by: Ligiah Villalobos
The Villalobos Test focuses on representation for Latina women and fighting common stereotypes. Firstly, there must be a Latina lead, and subsequently the lead — or another Latina character — must be shown as professional or college educated, as well as speaking unaccented English, and must not be sexualised (as a key character trait).

The Ko test:
Founded by: Naomi Ko
Ko’s criteria opens up a broader conversation around intersectionality and gender equality in film. To pass, the movie must feature a non-white, female-identifying person who has lines in at least five scenes, and speaks English.

The Peirce test:
Founded by: Kimberly Peirce
The Peirce Test focuses on the depth of female characters, with criteria being as follows: There must be a female character (protagonist or antagonist) with her own story, who has dimension and exists in an authentic way, showcasing her needs and desires which she ultimately pursues (creating action). In addition, the viewer has to also be able to understand or empathise with her and her needs/actions.

The Villarreal test:
Founded by: Lindsey Villarreal
This test is slightly more complex in its ways. A film is immediately failed if a leading female character is introduced in the film as a typical female stereotype. This includes her being sexualised, cold or heartless, or being presented as a matriarch. However, a film that fails this first criterion can salvage itself, provided that it passes with at least three of the following four things: she must have a career with a position of authority or power, be a mother, be reckless (or makes bad decisions), or be sexual/create or choose their own sexual identity.

The Landau test:
Founded by: Noga Landau
The criteria for the Landau Test focuses more on what a film shouldn’t have. A film fails if: a main female character ends up dead, pregnant, or if she causes a plot problem for a male protagonist.",1
903,"This is not really in answer to your question but it is why I really liked ghostbusters (new one). It passed, and passed with flying colours I think they only had one conversation in the whole film about a man. Most of it was about career, reputation, money, ghosts and Chinese food.",1
904,"I wouldn’t add anything to it and would rather get rid of it entirely. 

I don’t think art exists to please anyone or fit into any moral narrative. Art should not be restricted by what other people demand it to be. 

I’m pretty sure many movies I love wouldn’t pass the Bechdel test and I couldn’t care less because I don’t need a character to be a woman in order for me to identify with them.",1
905,"Inspired by the character from Pacific Rim. There was only one named female character in the movie so it didn't pass the Bechdel test, but she was the lead.  There's a bunch of other [ media tests](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Media_test) from that site as well, and that's just for feminism. I'm sure googling  ""media tests"" should get similar things for race, gender identity and other under represented groups.",1
906,"It’s also interesting to see which movies DO pass the Bechdel Test. For example, American Pie passes it, but is probably one of the most sexist movies I’ve personally ever seen.",1
907,"Kidney stones were nothing, but I had doc's permission to go home for three of them and lay into a six pack of beer. 


Alcohol should never, ever be used as medicine, except I managed to pass 3 medium to large stones with a minimal amount of blood and pain without lithotripsy. Had to pee through a strainer in order to capture the stones for the lab, which became progressively harder with each beer, but it worked and I didn't even need antibiotics.

Was blessed with another stent 🤦‍♀️ Worst pain ever. 20/10 wouldn’t even wish it on my worst enemy,1
910,My wife passed a kidney stone WHILE being induced unsuccessfully! It was AWFUL! Finally passed the stone and had a C-section. That’s a level of tough I can only imagine!,1
911,"I have kidney stones pretty often, and I've learned a couple things. Preparation and knowing what to expect is key:

\- See a Urologist every 3-6 months. They can take an X-Ray or a CT Scan and see exactly what's going on, and do lithotripsy, which isn't easy, but way easier and significantly cheaper than having kidney stones and going to the ER.

\- Keep Norco on hand. Norco doesn't make me nauseous, and is very potent. I take Motrin when the pain isn't too bad, but when it gets really bad, Norco literally saves me from having to go to the hospital, where they will try to give me morphine which makes me even more nauseous. Or if I tell them I don't want morphine, they will give me Norco, so very little reason to go to the hospital if I already have what they would give me! (and I know the stone isn't too big to pass, because I get scanned regularly)

\- If nausea is a big problem for you like it is for me, try to get a prescription of Zofran and Phenergan. Also have bread on hand to nibble on because it helps so so much. I prefer Ezekiel.

\- As soon as you start experiencing pain, schedule an appointment with your Urologist!!! This could save you tons of money and time so you won't need to go to the ER. Stones usually take a couple days at least to pass, and it starts off not too bad, and then gets a lot worse.

\- Get the app ""My Water"", and record how much water you drink daily. Drinking enough water is not something you want to slack on because stones can form in a matter of weeks. I have a really really hard time drinking enough water, and without this app I would probably drink half of what I should.

&#x200B;

The first stone I had was the worst, because I had no idea what to do. One of the worst moments of my life... Now it's still bad, but not so bad I have to go to the hospital.",1
912,"Childbirth can be such a wildly different experience between different women, and different births. Some people have bad menstrual cramp contractions and the baby comes out with barely a graze. Others have days of intense back labour and get torn and cut apart.
The labour for my first was fast and intense but not kidney stone level. However, the things done to my body to get the baby out when she got her shoulders stuck... let’s just say I’ve only passed out from pain once in my life.",1
913,"I never passed my kidney stones because they were so large, they actually went in thru my back to take them out. They were large enough that the urologist gave me a piece to take home. But suffering trying to pass them, having a stent, and them wreaking havoc on my kidneys for three months was worse than anything I could ever imagine.",1
914,"To me, the level of pain was about the same, but with labor, at least you get a break in between contractions, and it ends with a sweet little baby. Kidney stones are constant pain that can last much longer with no real breaks in the pain, and of course, no baby at the end, although passing a kidney stone can feel like a huge rock moving through.",1
915,"The stents are 100% worse than the stone, excruciatingly uncomfortable.",1
916,"Towards the end I was wondering if I was gonna die though. I remember thinking how is so much pain even possible. They were so strong and so close together I could barely catch my breath and I was so exhausted I felt I was sure to just collapse and die any minute. Never passed a kidney stone but I'm having another baby soon so I couldn't tell you on the former, but the latter is happening again so we all are massochists for some babies.",1
917,I’d find it weird. I’d try to track down his sister and pass it on to her. I want nothing of his.,1
918,"Assuming there was no one else that I could pass everything on to;

My ex was a very abusive person who made over 50+ people hate me. I couldn't walk through the hallways of my college without people looking at me and whispering. If they left me everything I'd need to find a friend to go through it. Just looking at their stuff makes me feel sick.

I'd probably feel like a train hit me. I might think it was a trick or something before finally going through their stuff.",1
919,"It wouldn't be that particular ex. I had a partner pass away while we were in avrelationship, and he left me nothing- no reason why  he would since we hadn't reached the ""update your will to include this person"" phase.   That was fucking hard because I mourned the loss of what might have been.",1
920,"I recently got married, and when telling my husband’s coworker she mentioned how she never got to wear her wedding dress that she bought back in the 80’s. I was worried it was because her partner passed or left her before they married, but nope, she just bought herself her dream dress before even being in a relationship. Then she never met anyone she wanted to marry.

It’s made me curious if anyone else has done this.",1
921,"I did this haha when I was 19, ten years ago. My best friend and I were really into looking at dresses online after binging Say Yes To The Dress. We were both single and in an eBay phase where we just ordered stuff because we could. She found a wedding dress that she thought was perfect for me, I thought it was gorgeous, and it was only $125 so bought it because what the hell lol I thought that I’d put it away for when the time came but didn’t want to pass it up. When it arrived it was a peach instead of a champagne color and cheaper fabric than advertised - surprise. I kept it for a while and eventually ended up donating it. 

Have not bought anymore wedding dresses since 😂",1
922,"I have not. But I am single and poor and I have an unusual body size/shape so every time I go to a thrift store/second hand shop I check their dress section just in case there’s a white dress that fits me and could pass as a wedding dress. I figure, since I’m there, I might as well look. 🤷🏻‍♀️",1
923,"Yes! 🙌 🙌 🌈 🙏 🌹 I actually found a BEAUTIFUL dress that fit me like a glove this summer at a outside sale of a cool shop in spfd MO, just Ealing my dog passing by and ♥️ I knew I was doing a photo shoot and when I saw it,I just instantly acted (so I didn't talk myself out of it) I was like, "" is this really only $30 and when it fit like  a dream, I bought it and did a quick shoot with it (on my insta feed @practicalsaint) 

I realized then, THAT is what we really want, what I wanted anyway! Pictures of us looking beautiful! Am I correct? my other wedding dress I bought off eBay for like $10 (it was gorgeous),I had work done to it but then have it away after my divorce and move. In this day and age, it's phycho to actually get married 😅 instead of just treat ourselves like Queens ery dang day! You know 👌😍❤️❤️❤️♥️♥️I love u my sistars. Go out,get your nails done,get your hair did, get a beautiful dress and have a friend take some beautiful pics at a beautiful place, I promise a wedding doesn't sound so necessary after that lol 🙌 🏡 and yeas EVERY PERSON needs a fabulous outfit(dress) to go to the ballet in ;) ( PS I've been married twice had 3 weddings..?all of em were pretty shitty events 😭🤷⚡️⚡️xoxo kolee",1

926,"Finding my grandpa dead. It was the day before my exams were starting. I had just sat to resume studying after my evening tea. A friend of grandfather's came home in a hurry to inform us that he was hurt. He had fainted on his way back home from the temple. Only my other grandparents were home and I had to go with my other grandfather and the friend to the place. 

My grandfather was there lying on the path to enter a restaurant. A group of people around him. He was cold. I knew the second I saw him. I knew he was gone. My mom came by then in another taxi to take him to the hospital. I remember gathering his things from the vegetable vendors there. I just stood there wondering what to do. I was not in my senses. A random passer by told me they'll drop me home. 

I was so confused I couldn't even give directions. It was a 3 minute walk. Single road. I just couldn't speak. I came home and had to manage my grandmothers who were home. I filled them in and I was told to go study. The grandma who's husband died called me from the hospital to study. She told my grandpa will want me to do well in exams. 

I somehow managed. Wrote the exam and remember breaking down after it was over. My friends didn't know what had happened. I had just asked what will happen if I don't write the exam. I cried all the way back home from college. It was a 2.5 hour journey. It was the worst time of my life. 

I couldn't mourn. I couldn't study. I was guilty of not reaching the place earlier. It was the worst period. I had a meltdown the next day when they were performing the religious rituals on thatha. I even went to the crematorium because I wanted to be with him till the end. 

I'm better now. Still can't believe I went through that. I used to not be able to walk past the restaurant for almost a year. I got over that and even recently went to eat there. I just miss my thatha so much. He was such a smart person. Loving and kind.",1

I was getting ready to leave, about an hour later (I was out of town heading back in when I got the call) and I got the call that he had passed away suddenly. I had already prepared for him dying, but had given myself the solace and hope of seeing him alive one last time. The fact that I wasn’t able to say goodbye was rough.",1
929,Oof.  My father passed away very suddenly about five months ago.  It was completely out of the blue and I’m still reeling.  Sorry this happened to you. Solidarity.,1
930,"Back in 2016 a cousin reached out to me on Facebook to tell me my biological dad was in a hospice and was given around 3 weeks to live. I hadn't seen him since I was 8 and thought I didn't care but it hit me like a tonne of bricks. I had so many unanswered questions that I had pushed to the back of my mind for over a decade, and I also realised there was half of me that I knew nothing about. 

I arranged to go and see him 2 days after my cousin got in contact but found out on the day that he had passed away. If I could go back to my past self I'd advise her to get in contact years earlier, not necessarily for a relationship but for some closure.",1
931,"I had been estranged from my father for 14 years.

His social worker called me and said he had a week to live and his dying wish was to see me. He also said a lot of other things that convinced me to see him, like telling me he was too unwell to get up etc.

I dunno. I never imagined I would say yes. But I did.

My dad had been in and out of jail, and mental institutions and halfway houses and he had been homeless. He had had violent outbursts with me. He had threatened to kill me, he violated restraining orders. I don’t know why I went. The social worker said my dad had electroshock therapy and was miraculously better.

I went. My dad sprung out of bed and hugged me and cried. He shrunk like six inches, he had lost all his teeth. It was crazy and it was too late for me to turn back.

He lived for 7 more months and I visited him once a week as I didn’t know how to say “no”

He had no friends- he had been estranged from everyone. My mom called everyone. Only one person agreed to see him. I understood, everyone had to make the right choice for themselves and I understand they were not ready to forgive him for what he did to them.

I practiced a lot of compassion. I promised myself that if there were just one insult or threat I’d leave and never go back - he never did.

It was a long strange thing. I think my story is quite unusual.

I still say - you know what is right for you. Trust yourself. However you feel is ok. You don’t owe them anything.

For me, healing my anger required compassion and I learned that closure is something you give yourself. I had already worked through what I needed to.

There is no right answer that works for everyone.",1
932,"I took one day at a time and chose to pray for and wish the best for them. My paternal grandfather was diagnosed with leukodysplasia about two years before he died in late December 2013. I was surprised at how quickly he passed the day he was supposed to have his first surgery/chemo (?), as he passed very quickly after receiving morphine for pain. He was also emotionally abusive when I was a kid. As such, I felt surprise when my dad called my sister to let us know our grandfather passed on  and relief that he couldn't hurt us anymore even though we'd been estranged from him for almost ten years then. That came with a touch of sadness and concern for my living paternal family, but also remembered I could not control how they handled his illness and passing, just my response to any ill-treatment, etc. I might receive.   


Taking one day at a time and not letting estranged family members, including my grandfather, use his illness to hurt me did wonders, in sum!",1
933,"I'll tell you what my best friend did. Her father has been absent from her life for the most part of her life and when he was involved, it wasn't a good experience. In her late 20s, he got diagnosed with cancer with 2 years estimated time to live. She did think about what to do and decided to not let him back into her life. She felt nothing changed about their relationship because he was ill. Like that wasn't about their relationship. She felt sorry for what he did to himself, she got upset again about her childhood but it was a short-lived depression.

She still contributed to his treatment financially and when he died about 5-6 years later went to his funeral. That's all. One of her older sisters did the same. Her other older sister was far more involved. She was the one who went to the hospital and stayed with him, found people to take care of him, etc It was partially because out of the three sisters she was the only one who didn't work and had more flexible hours. It still caused a problem between the sisters but the other two told her she could choose to not do more but shouldn't expect them to support her when that meant being involved with their father. I think it's fair.

He passed over a year ago. None of the daughters regret their decision.",1

They described to me what they’d taken, there was limited restrictions as she was being buried. You would not believe the list, it was long and a lot of the stuff held little significants it genuinely felt like they were using it as an opportunity to have a clear out.

A few months later, we were at another friends birthday party and we were drinking. She started telling these people we weren’t friends with, the story of how I was wasted and how she had to step over me to go to the toilet.

We started talking less about our lives and we would always start a convo with “Oh did I tell you?” And “no, we never talk anymore haha”

I like to just come in, do my work with minimal supervision and go home. I also like being able to pass off issues to my manager when it's clearly above my responsibility.

942,"Going through alternative school.

It was fucking horrible, every day, I had to get a fucking pat down and walk through a metal detector going in. It was humiliating, dehumanizing, and worst of all, it triggered my fucking dysphoria to the Nth degree. It wasn’t uncommon for me to break down in tears after :(. On top of that, I had a personal escort that had to take me to and from every class, and if I dared defy them, I’d go to juvenile detention center. I had to wear the uniform, which was just shorts and a polo short, which framed me so much as a boy, that I literally just gave up eventually and lied through my teeth that I was a boy, just so they would leave me the fuck alone. Oh, and the students, they were utter assholes, constantly making fun of everybody, being assholes, and outright ignoring literally everyone outside of their small ingroups: in a school of less than 300 students. The bus rides were pretty bad too, literally 40 minutes of silence both ways, and I couldn’t have even brought my phone, and I knew no one.

I was hospitalized TWICE in a crisis center, for one week each time, because of how bad it was. That’s just something I should say before I continue.

To make things worse, we weren’t allowed to have phones, or bags at the school. Which meant no opportunity to even distract myself. No bringing a skirt to school and changing into it secretly, no pulling out my phone during passing periods to remind myself that I was indeed living in the real world, not even a notebook for sketching. The only support network I actually had was the counselor (they wouldn’t let me speak to my family over a school phone), and I cried to her countless times about my dysphoria, the students being awful, and everything else.

The schoolwork wasn’t much better either. I literally learned nothing in there, the most we ever got was one worksheet, no textbooks, no resources, no presentations. The only class I ever learned anything in was math, and it was a continuation of geometry, which was decidedly my worst math subject, and kinda still is. Not to mention that they shipped over work from my main campus, but couldn’t ship any resources, or even give me recorded lectures. I was clueless on how to do Latin, to the point where I literally had no option but to use google translate: so I wasn’t even having fun learning a new language.

There was only a few saving graces:

1. I was able to at least wear panties to school, they didn’t police underwear. I was able to wear makeup too, but it didn’t change much, as I didn’t know contouring, or even how to do eyeliner back then.

2. The computers at school had YouTube unlocked, but only a weird selection of videos. There were only a handful of music videos available, and even less gameplay videos. I was able to watch like 5 osu! videos, which was a nice distraction (they were relatively recent too). But as for music, well, just about the only songs I could play from there was the nightcore remix of *Take A Hint* and *Burnt Rice*: take a guess how burned into my head the songs were… still better than silence though. (reality is lemons and the internet’s my lemonade).

3. I was somehow able to watch all of *Rick and Morty* season 1, and the first three episodes of *Gravity Falls*while in ISS. Yep, after I finished my main classes (they didn’t even send over all the work, so this wasn’t hard), I would just ask for a computer, and more often than not, I would get it. I’d sometimes get books, but I wouldn’t care. The ISS monitor definitely hated her job and wasn’t a control freak. There was literally one time where near the end of the class, I put on a video of Cookiezi playing *Revolutionary Etude* - Without headphones -, at near max volume (to be fair, it wasn’t **that** loud), and she gave zero shits as this random guy started watching too (he moved closer to me to see).

You wanna know the real kicker of this story? I was only supposed to be in there for 15 days. Literally just 15 days. I couldn’t even do that, because it was so fucking awful, and mentally damaging.

-

You might be asking, How I’ve dealt with it? Well, I’ve Repressed the shit out of the memories, that’s for sure. I’ve mostly just either gotten kinda drunk, stress eaten my hair, gone for a smoke, or just cried it all out until they go away. When something was really bad, it never truly leaves, but I certainly try my best to cope. Lately I’m hoping that I can go back to school to undo my bad high school years, and maybe get a good memory or two out of it. I can only pray…

This is one of the few things in my life that makes me cry just thinking about it. Not to mention psyche doctors were drugging me through the tail end of this shit, and started prescribing way more drugs after I had to leave the alternative school as well (I left in late October, not sure exactly how many days even passed, or what I was there).

The memories may be fuzzy at points, but they still hurt…",1
943,"I battled a opioid addiction for a few years and lost everything that was important in a matter of 6 days. My job, my apartment, my car broke and then I overdosed 5 days before my 30th birthday. I went to an inpatient rehab facility for 15 months and was sober the entire time. 3 days after I took a few pills from my stepfather because we had a 3 hour drive back home and I thought it would feel good to relax. I was good for a few months after that but then started using occasional for fun. I began hanging out with a guy who I met in rehab. I actually could not stand him when I first met him. When he completed his program he ended up staying in the same area that I lived in and figured I'd reach out to him as a familiar face. To speed this up a bit we ended up becoming great friends and then fought back in forth for a few years. We also started using together and our friendship became very toxic. He ended up getting arrested in his home state with my car and was not able to come back. I what occasionally drives down to see him so that we could use. He eventually got so out of control that he was sent to another program in Florida where his mom lived. I started going to counseling in my state and was still not 100% but I wasn't doing as bad as I was prior to that. I was in Florida for vacation and was able to see him and we were both sober and it was such a great day. After that we continued to talk and be friends as we were in the beginning. About a year goes by and I know that he's using again but I didn't realize how severely he was. I was going back to Florida to see him already had my flight booked and everything and almost one month before we were leaving he ended up dying. I received a text message from his mom in the morning who I am very close to I was unable to say anything to anyone until later that day when she had more details. I spent 5 hours thinking about everything we had done over the years and wishing I could go back and change it. He was the best friend I had ever had we've been through so much together so many memories good and bad are families loved each other it was just something I never thought would happen. After he passed I decided that the drugs were not worth the pain. The pain inflicted on me on his family and friends and I would never want my friends or family to go through what I was feeling at that moment . So I vowed to get sober and live every day for him About a month later I went to see my doctor and got sober and have been sober since October 10th 2017. There was a time that I wasn't sure if I would ever get sober but losing him was the wake-up call I needed. I would give anything to have him back but I think that him knowing that I am okay now made it worth it. So I guess getting sober and good morning my best friend was the hardest thing I ever had to go through.",1
944,"I have seen some posts like this, and I for sure don't agree. In a lot of ways my self identity definitely solidified around the age of 24-26. But in no way do I have everything sorted out, whatever that even means!

That's what life is, it's not perfect.

Nothing is permanent, and hopefully that comforts you! If you're struggling or in a period of uncertainty now, that won't last and that will pass!

945,"I'm in my 30s and the only thing I can say about passing 25 is it's the point where people kinda settle into who they are. Like who I was inside at 20 vs 25 is a huge difference but who I was at 30 vs 25 isn't, or even 25 vs 35 is still pretty much the same. There's some outside difference like I've figured out what kind of job I want and I'm more financially comfortable, but the kind of person I am has settled down.

So from that point of view, generally speaking, 25 is a big milestone, but in a good way. I love being in my 30s",1
946,"To me, it's not a landmark set in stone, but it does seem like, in their mid-20s, people should be midway between their teens and young adult years, and the point where they at least begin to consider getting their shit together. Knowing themselves as people, building a life that they like, starting to question the baggage they were brought up with and starting to work towards overcoming it if need be, finding at least some passions and abilities that might point them in the direction of a career. Of course, all of these things should be life-long pursuits, and it's never too late for most of them, and of course the age of 25 is completely arbitrary and should never be seen as a ""best before"" expiration date. But it does kinda feel to me like it's around this point in someone's life that they should get their shit together and start becoming the person they want to be.

Which is, on the other hand, why (again, to me personally) it seems too young for marriage and kids, house and car (in cases where it's not necessary). But to each their own, of course.

Edit: the nice thing you'll notice is, the older you get, the less you give a shit about what others think about what your life should look like. I'm 34 now, and I'm the happiest I've ever been, best skin ever, the same weight I had at 18 but much better self-care and beauty knowledge, the most amazing sex life, no kids (people are finally believing me I don't want any), and a complete and utter lack of shits given as far as to what others think my life should look like.",1
947,"> .idk it seems arbitrary? I mean, is 25 generally considered “older”?

I don't take it literally and focus on what they're actually trying to say without the specific number 25.

Usually when I see it mentioned, they're referring to someone (for example) on /r/relationships who is 19 and engaged to be married and both living at home with parents.

I have no room to talk being that I met my SO when I was 21 and we've now been together 8.5 years.. BUT generally speaking, the person you're with at a young age has a higher likelihood of not being the person you're with long term. So people like to say to wait until at least 25 to get married -- not so much because it definitely *won't* work at a younger age, but because it lessens your chances if you wait.

> “too old” for a lot of things (like dressing a certain way, or feeling unsure in life, which someone who is only a couple of years younger gets a free pass for). I’ve even seen people here say that once you’re 25, you’re not “young” anymore (this is also implied when I see posts targeted towards “older women”, 25 is always the cutoff age)

Kinda same as above - I think it is more a general ""range"" than a hard set thing.

25 is still young enough to get away with a lot clothing wise - almost anything. But I do personally abide by the sentiment that certain clothing more difficult to get away with as we age. You can certainly wear a Tweety Bird tiedye shirt to a job interview if you so choose, but you are putting yourself at a disadvantage by doing so. Same for anything sexy/revealing.. or a full goth getup. Basically - you do you, but we live in a society. You will be perceived accordingly.

Same goes for direction in life. As someone who is still friends with a LOT of people in their 30s that are bartenders and will likely be bartenders as long as they can, I certainly don't think there's anything wrong with not having shit ""figured out"".

But as you start to get up in your later 20s, you are generally expected to be able to take care of yourself and pull your weight in (for example) a romantic relationship. Or even a friendship. Relationships of any kind require both parties to provide partnership to a certain extent. When we are young, not so much the case. But I mean yeah if you can't pay for your half of dinner when you are out with friends, they will likely see something wrong with that.

The friends I mention above have literally not even $100 saved in a bank account, have no health insurance, etc. They aren't ""in the wrong"", but there's no denying they'd be royally screwed if something happened to them. And as they get older, the chances of that happening will continue to increase.",1

I also make a point to look to the side once in awhile for a second because while I hate the length of my drive, I pass some very beautiful landscape. I live on the gulf and drive along bays and along bluffs overlooking the water for the first 15-20 minutes of my drive, 20-30 minutes of it if I take the 'long' way that goes further down the bluffs.

More often than I’d like, I’m contacted by admin or guidance to let a kid pass despite the failure, and sometimes I’m overruled!!!! The kid passes the course anyways!!! It makes me livid.

I want all my kids to pass, I don’t want failure for them, and I work hard so they have a good chance. But when a kid shows up 20 times and completes a quarter of the assignments they can’t  pass because they can’t get credit for things they didn’t do. What message does that send?",1

We’ve all taken up this “ritual”. I often think of my grandma or father-in-law.",1

970,"My mom died of sepsis as a result of an infection that she got in the first place because of MS, not cancer. I'm answering because I think it's somewhat similar in that we knew she was dying for a long time (before the sepsis, we were told her liver was failing) so it wasn't a shock. If this comment is too deraily and needs to be pulled, I totally understand.

Ask her so many questions: about high school, about her life before kids, about hopes and dreams and victories, about romance and summer jobs. Ask about what it was like when she was pregnant with you, maybe what was going on in her head. Ask about any stories from your childhood that she remembers strongly, or that she wants to tell you. Ask what she thought of the world before you and what she thinks of it now. Ask what she hopes for the world, and what she hopes for you. Write this stuff down, or maybe even record it.

When I was sitting by her hospital bed, I didn't ask these questions because there was always some other family member nearby and I felt weird about it. I really regret not taking the time to find out more about the person my mother was and what she hoped for. (She died when I was still a teenager so our relationship hadn't yet grown into that adult-to-adult thing that a lot of people have.) Without getting too schmaltzy, I really wish I knew how she'd feel about me and the world around me now.",1
971,"So I (20F) just had a mom who died of breast cancer 4 months ago. She was smart about it  she made all the arrangements beforehand, put all her passwords and accounts all in one excel file and gave them to me. It's really helped now that I'm organizing the family finances and managing all her accounts, or getting rid of them. 

Talk about how she wants to die, at home or in a hospital/hospice center. Whether or not she wants a funeral. Does she have belongings she wants sent to people. Does she have an up to date will? 

Bank accounts are huge, are they a joint with her husband if so that has to get sorted. God we didn't know what an ordeal that would be. 

Know when to call hospice. Don't be brave and say you can take care of her yourself. I did this for a few months while she was bedridden and it was horrible. I'm glad I got to be there for her. But having a medical professional checking in and visiting your home takes away SO much stress. 

As for the emotion of things. Make a TON of jokes. As horrible as it sounds, taking it seriously at all times can be catastrophic to everyone involved. Seriously humour with my brother and father was HUGELY beneficial to our coping process. 

Try not to dread the after too much. You oddly feel a sense of relief when she passes, the bad is behind you and you'll have already seen and hit rock bottom. I didn't even realize I had. I was already on the upswing the day after she died, horrible as it sounds. 

Spend as much time with her as possible, remember why mothers and daughters are best friends. My mom was mine and I'm glad I stuck by her side through it all, no matter how painful it was.",1
972,"Make new memories. For me,  I cherish those memories more than anything else. 

We did stuff together, we watched old movies,  as well as Jeopardy. I still remember the last final jeopardy question we watched.. We took drives and made crafts.

973,"When my dad was dying from lung cancer we sat down and made a bucket list, we assumed we had about a year before he passed and we wanted to knock off as much as possible. He unfortunately had a terrible reaction to the chemotherapy and he was too sick to do much of anything within 2 weeks of treatment and passed away about 3 months after the diagnosis.

I was so angry that instead of 12 months we only got 3 and we didn’t get to do anything on that list.

Be prepared to not be able to do the fun things anymore. Sometimes it can be too difficult for them to even get out of bed much less go on a walk, so if there’s something she loves try to bring it to her. 

Spend as much time as you can, you never know when the meds or cancer starts to eat away at her mental abilities. Watching my dad go from the smartest person in any room to repeatedly asking the same question over and over again was heart breaking.

I’m glad I got to be there for his last months. And as hard as it was watching him die I don’t remember him as the shell of himself he was when he was in a coma for the last couple days of his life. I have many good memories and honestly I think it made him happy talking about the good times we had as a family.

Nothing is going to prepare you for everything that could happen, but just roll with the punches and be present. 

Make sure all her legal stuff is in order too- wills, memberships that need to be canceled, etc. it’s been 9 years and we’re dealing with having to get a death certificate to sell a car that was on my dad’s name when he passed. 

There’s going to be puke, blood, soiled bedsheets, confusion and a lot of tears.

Find a good therapist, I waited until about 5 years after he passed to start seeing one. I wish I would have much earlier.

Best of luck. I hope ask her wishes are fulfilled.

If you have any questions or just want an ear to bend/ commiserate with feel free to PM me. It’s a shitty journey but I’m glad you said you have a good support system, that’s with its weight in gold.",1
974,"My mother passed October 2016 from endometrial cancer.  Just remember to take care of you and see a therapist.  My mother's passing sent me into such a depression because the worst that could happen, did.  I'm the oldest child and my Dad was beside himself.  So just remember that it's ok to cry-dont try to be 'strong' by not crying and cramming it down.

1. Make sure to have all the plans in place for funeral, so you don't have to make any decisions later.  
2. Be sure that there is enough space in her bedroom for the hospital bed when hospice comes.
3. It's gonna suck hard.
4. Find where her sentimental/expensive jewelry is.  I remember Dad and my sister couldn't find her heirlooms for us to inherit.  Then, when they were cleaning out the closet, it was in a plain box at the bottom of the closet, and not in her jewelry box 
5. Are there people who want to say a few words to her before she passes?  Be sure to also say your goodbyes.  I did it when Mom went into a coma, a few days before she died.
6. Be prepared when she does go into the coma (if she does, her jaw muscles will go slack and it bothered me more than it should have).
7. I administered her morphine when she was home, and I kept a log of how much and what time i administered it. 8. I do remember a friend was retired policeman and he had to do something special with the remaining morphine.

I can't really think of anything else, but please feel free to ask questions.  I hope this helps some.

I was living with her at the time and did everything with her but i still wish I had something tangible to look at :( memories are there but they aren't really enough sometimes.

One thing I did for my mom was contacting her old friends. They came to visit her and that made her very happy. 

This might sound weird but ask her to write you a memory note, and save it. Last May I accidentally found a note my mom left me ( I knew she wrote toward the end because of the bad hand writting) That note made me start living again and got me out of a very bad relationship I was in. It's like she was there for me at a time I really really needed my mother with me.

Also take some time off if you can afford it and just be with her. Get to know some of her routines,  it will help you later on to do the things she did. I bake and cook a lot because that's what I got from her and it makes me happy to do what she used to do. It makes me feel like I still have something of hers.

My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family...",1

Use your fingers to memorize curve of her nose, the touch of her cheeks and the smooth sensation of her eyelids. It will not be creepy, trust me.

Hold her hands, smell her scent and be happy that she's still here. Bask in her presence, and remember that feeling. Let her know that you love her, that you've always loved her and shower her with adoration, as when she passes, she knows that her baby loves her. 

Acknowledge everything that you can remember, and don't bring up any regrets. Love her as much as you can, as much as you can muster. Spend as much time as you can with her. Remind her of the happy moments in life.",1
980,"My dad died of cancer over the summer. A few things beyond what others have mentioned: my dad got very frail and weak, and it was difficult to see him declining in that way. His breath smelled absolutely horrific and it was really hard to physically be near him (of course I sucked it up because I knew time was limited and it was, at least I think, the cancer that made him stinky. Not much to do about that). Be prepared to process what you’re seeing in addition to what is going to happen. 

After he passed, those first few days were an absolute mist of things to do, shit to process, and FEELINGS. I was personally in no condition to make decisions, so I might recommend having someone in your support network help you. For example, while I took that first week off of work, I kept responding to emails and even accepted a project that needed to be completed that week. Looking back I could have used someone to gently close my laptop for me. 

One last thing to think about is your mom’s final wishes. My dad had a will, but it was shockingly light on details about what he wanted after he died. My mom and I thought it was all laid out, but it really wasn’t. The night he passed (he was at home), people were asking questions like “what mortuary do you want us to call?” And we were like.... uh no clue. Should we check yelp for recommendations? The hospice nurse did help us figure that out, but again- we were in that mist of grief/confusion. Having a clearer plan would have been helpful in those first moments. 

Feel free to dm me any time. It’s a lot and a horrible burden to bear, even with a good support network.",1
981,"My stepmom’s fight lasted five long, beautiful, and horrific years. When I suspected something went wrong, her daughter knew immediately, what started out as breast cancer that had already spread to bones and her kidneys, was now in her brain. 

She passed 11 days after the diagnosis. I think for yourself, the best that you can do is to have a quiet moment with her if possible. Say the things you always wanted to. 

I never got to properly say goodbye, she was already in a coma by the time I got to see her in hospital. I didn’t have the proper supports, and I myself have an illness. It just triggered flares for me. I was so busy trying to make sure my father was eating and sleeping. 

Be prepared because family will fall out. My stepsister only had her grandma here in the country after her mom passed and my father was too much of a wreck to try and keep up with her, or even try and heal together because they’d both been caring for her so long. He lost touch with her and after a year of pushing, my sister and I finally got to reconnect with her. It’s such a sore subject now that he and I don’t speak. Be prepared because my stepmom was definitely the glue that held our family together. She was the absolute love of his life, a joy to have around, she’d light up every room and make you feel part of the family. 

Try to get the legal stuff done as soon as possible so you can cherish the last moments you have. And make sure there are as many moments as possible. Prepare yourself for seeing her in a vulnerable way, because parents don’t always like to be seen as such. There is also something truly heartbreaking about having a nurse flush fluids out of their lungs knowing it’s just going to fill up again while you’re waiting for them to leave you.",1
982,"Take. Pictures. With. Her. My mom just passed due to a hysterectomy gone wrong because of cancer. I had maybe three pictures with her before any of this. Be patient with her and if there’s a chance she can recover be patient within her recovery. And most of all, take your time processing.",1
983,"Right now you don’t know how long she’ll still be here, and how she’ll feel. So what you should do is what feels right for you to do. This stuff is hard, no one prepares you for this and I guess no one can. It’s okay to call in sick to be with your mom, and it’s also okay to need time for yourself. Don’t feel guilty about what you are doing or feeling cause you are doing the best you can in a very, very difficult situations. 

My father was sick for 1,5 years before passing away. We just wanted to do fun stuff together, stuff we’d normally do as well. Like getting ice cream, going to the movies or going to the same old vacation spot we’ve always been to. Looking back I’m glad we got to do all of it. 

After he passed, we had pillows made from his clothes. Just an idea what you could do, for me it’s comforting to hug my pillow when I think about him and am sad.",1

I wish I could have hugged her held her more. I wish we had more outings and mom and me moments. Gone to dinner, mall, walks and trips. I was young and I just didn’t know. My mom must have been so overwhelmed (we were 14 siblings). My biggest regret is not getting to know her and telling her how much I loved and appreciated everything she did for me, us. She was the world and was the glue that held us all together. Our family has been broken ever since. I’m sorry that you are going through this. It’s not easy but hold her , love her, smell her. You will miss all of that.",1

-Hearing is the last sense to go.

-Don't feel bad if her passing gives you a feeling you weren't expecting. I felt relief when my grandma died because for the six weeks leading up to her death, the house was pure chaos.

-There's no point in beating yourself up from regret. Try not to think, ""I could've done/said this!"" 

-It's far better to pass in a home than in a hospital. 

-Grief is weird. I didn't experience grief until a few years until my grandma died.",1
987,"We watched chick flicks like Dirty Dancing and laughed as we said the lines.  I was there from dx to her dying in my arms.   The biggest regret I have is not having recorded her voice.  It was 15 years ago but it seems like yesterday.   It is the worst pain and suffering both of us have ever endured.  She is at peace but the grief is unending and randomly triggered.   Make sure hospice comes to help you and her, and get the counseling from them once she passes.  You will need it the first year for sure.   Also, don’t make big decisions/changes the first year, too.  Grief makes for irrational decisions.   Bless you and your mom.",1
988,"For all those that say record your voice. Do it. I have 6 voicemails from my mom who passed from a long battle of cancer last September. It was very sudden to us, because she had been fighting it for so many years and then within days things did a 360.  Have her write you something that you can read and cherish.  For us, it really helped to know that she was no longer in pain. She had been in so much pain for so long, she could finally rest.  It never stops hurting, but it gets easier to cope. Even though it hurts, I listen to her voicemails to remind me, because I don’t want to forget her voice. That helps.",1
989,"Dealing with the situation right now (Mom undergoing chemo; and dad miraculously emerged from 4th cancer last year) so while I ain’t a women, I guess I am eligible to respond.
1st thing 1st, SHE IS NOT DYING COZ YOU ARE NOT GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN. She is just ailing and you and your family shall emerge victorious. Relax, clear your head and pull-up your Socks. 
Disbelief> Regret> Fear> Denial> Hope; I think these are the 5 stages of emotional journey for a cancer patient plus the pain, side effects of therapy, weight loss, appetite loss, etc. 
1. So the first thing is to be aware and alert towards what your mom is going through and accordingly respond with palliative care. This includes emotional and physical care.
2. Cancer is malignant, it spreads and in advanced stages can cause organ failures or sudden complications. Have an emergency plan of action ready. Ask your doctor what are emergency possibilities and be ready what will you do in case.
3. It’s an expensive disease, be ready with back-up finances 
4. Most important: you cannot have another patient to attend to right now. So everyone else in the family must take better than usual care of themselves
5. If you can, employ atleast a 12-hr paramedic at home. Depending upon type and stage, Cancer patients face delirium, need help with moving, washing and cleaning, etc. It is quite a toll on the primary caregiver. Have someone to share the load at night so the primary caregiver stays well. Shall also help your mom maintain her hygiene, make-up (y she looked beautiful all her life, y not now?), etc
6. Help her attend to her unfinished work, last wishes, etc
7. Spend sometime with her each day and talk to her the good times she had in her life. So when the soul passes away, it remembers this life fondly. Smile often. 
8. Meditate. You are old enough. You have all the answers. Close your eyes and clear your mind. You can do this. You can help her fight it out or move to next level with peace. 
All the best. May God we with you all",1

Get her to write a letter to you, and if you have children, to them too. Maybe even a letter to your future children if you don't have any yet.
Like so many others have said, record her voice, whether by audio clio or video. I can't remember my mum's voice and I hate it. 
Get lots of pictures of her. Even if she's poorly. Pictures of my mum are few and far in between as she always took them. Pictures with the two of you as well, even if it's selfies. 
Any special recipes she had or meals she liked to cook, get her to write it down for you. 
Make sure you get any special jewellery or clothes of hers once the time comes. Because of how my mum passed and how young I was I was never consulted, and I'm sure the jewlery she always wore which was a part of her identity were thrown away with her clothes or something, as I was never able to find it, and I'm still devastated about it 15 years later.",1

Since she was living with us when we were young, I got to spend a lot of time with her. I always tease her when she eats because when she chews her food, it's as if she has no teeth at all. 

One of my fondest memories of her was during my birthday celebrations with her. She always cooks me spaghetti, chicken lollipops and my favorite dessert, leche flan.

That's why it broke my heart when she passed away days away from my birthday.

I just wished that I had more time to tell her how she means to me. I wish I've spent more time with her. I also wish I got to take more pictures with her but, unfortunately, during that time we didn't have our smartphones yet.

I still regret not being there when she took her last breath. But I do hope she still watches over me.

After I lost my mom at 24 I found that her handwriting was such an intimate way to connect to her as this was the early 2000’s before people videoed a lot on phones and cameras.

Please hold her hand and stroke her face even though she looks fragile. I remember mom crying one day because she felt like no one wanted to touch her but it was because she was in so much pain and I didn’t want to cause her more by holding her or touching her. Know that you will be exhausted, that you can’t be there every second for her. Your heart is breaking, you’re under extreme stress and you’re grieving. Learn to forgive yourself for the moments you felt like you should’ve been there but weren’t. And most of all, let her know it’s ok to go when she’s ready. So often we put this pressure on people to stay because we need them and love them. But letting them know that it’s ok, that you understand they can’t fight any longer and that they aren’t giving up just moving on can be a HUGE sense of peace for everyone.

We were never really a close family, we didn’t have “real” conversations with each other but we had “cold” love. I really loved my mom so much more than my father. 


When my mom got sick I had to constantly clean our apartment because my father was working and basically had very low need of hygiene around our home. I also had to learn to cook myself food and do shopping and budget the money we had, my mom used to do this. It was a bit too much for a 18 yo at first but I managed pretty well. We knew it was terminal but she didn’t know. She was hoping and praying every day so she gets healthy again. Unfortunately at the time I was very closed emotionally therefore eventually taking care of shit started to feel like chores and got me annoyed. I did them regardless but it was a topic for many fights with my father and I knew those fights were not a good effect on my mom’s health.


Later on she got into hospice. They said she has around a week or so. She held on for so long, she was there for a month in the end. The hospice was in another city so it was quite hard but we managed to visit her every day. She always asked when is she coming home and it broke my fucking heart. She was so high on morphines and she was in ton of pain. I told her “soon”. I lied to her on her death bed. So, don’t lie to your dying mother even if it is for comfort. It haunts me to this day and I’m 26 now. In her last few days she was so high on morphine we couldn’t even talk with her we just sit there and took care of her, etc. One day I thought to myself “fuck this that really isn’t my mom there anymore it’s just her body her soul is gone”. I didn’t go that day. She passed away that night. Sometimes I think to myself she felt like she was a burden to me and she just let herself go so she doesn’t bother me anymore. I wish I could go back in time and spend the last few days with her. I also don’t have any photos of her but I still remember her face and laugh and that’s something I’m gonna hold on for forever.


I shouldn’t have wrote this at work I’m about to fucking cry",1
996,"My mom passed away from breast cancer when I was 16. We knew it was coming, but none of us had ever dealt with something like this, and now we have a lot of regrets. 

If she's able, have her write you a letter. Going through old birthday cards and old text messages still mean a lot, but I don't have much written that has any substance. It would have been nice if we had thought to have her write letters for future events with advice, but now we have to rely solely on memory. 

My grandparents had her house cleared out and on the market within a week after she was gone. They didn't give any of us much time to go through her things before they donated it all. Everyone grieves differently and I'm not mad at them, but there are a few things that I wish we had held onto. If you're not sure, but it's too painful to look at, put things in storage until you're ready. Even now, 7 years later, I'll be getting ready to go somewhere and wish I had one of her jackets or scarves that I could wear. 

Have her draft a will ASAP. Death can bring out the worst in people and the last thing you will want to do is fight with relatives over money / material possessions.  No one thinks that their family is capable of that, but I've seen it happen time and time again. 

If she's still healthy, I would recommend taking as many photos of you two together and try going on a short trip. Once my mom got too sick, we stopped taking photos because she refused to be remembered like that. I wish I had snapped a few more before it got to that point. 

I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot, but my inbox is open if you want to talk. Praying for you, friend.",1
997,"My little sister's mom passed away from cancer almost 4 years ago. They spent a lot of time together, but, I love the voice idea. I dont know if she did that, I hope she did",1
998,"My mother passed away from brain cancer 3 years ago. Reading these comments, I feel like my story needs to be said because it's different from most here.

She was a flawed person and my mom and I never had a really good relationship. That doesn't mean that I didn't love her, I just couldn't get along with her. Taking care of someone you don't get along with was really tough- so be kind to yourself and give yourself time too as a caretaker.

I asked her to do many of the things people suggested here but she said no to all of them. She couldn't write because the cancer made her disabled in the right side of her body (she was right handed). She didn't want to be video recorded because she looked ""ugly and fat."" She didn't want to draw or do anything. She just wanted to cry and watch violent crime dramas. I sat and watched more crime dramas in a lifetime in those 2.5 years. But I'd like to think it gave her some happiness just sitting there with her.

Sometimes, it felt very lonely and isolating. Like this was all happening on an island and my friends and support system were too far from it...I was too far from them and they forgot about me. They didn't call to ask how I was doing, some pretended my mom didn't have cancer, others acted like I too had cancer and stayed away the same. When I asked my best friend why she never asked if I was ok she said she wasn't sure it was appropriate to ask knowing I had so much going on. Tell people to ask you what you want. Tell them to show up, tell them to not assume you don't or do want to talk about it. People don't know how to deal with grief, it's not their fault, but ask for the support you need. And you will need it.

People will disappoint you, a lot. Your family, your mom's spouse, your friends. But there will also be people who show up in ways you never expected. Hold onto those people and cherish them. Going through this really helps you to understand those who can show up in tough situations. My husband was my rock and continues to be. He showed up in ways I never expected but it really solidified that even if I was a failure in life, at least I married the right person.",1
999,"Spend a lot of time with her. Take pictures of you two together. Make her record a message for you that you can listen to when the time comes and can make you feel at ease a bit, or even just to remember her voice. Keep something from her with you and spray it with her signature perfume. Ask her whatever you want to know the answer to. Collect stuff with her handwriting on it. 

My mom died 8 years ago when I was 12, I don’t have any recordings and almost no pictures of us together. I didn’t spend a lot of time with her because of school and because I wanted to hang out with friends. I regret that so much cause I can’t get those moments back. I’m starting to forget what her voice sounds like, I’m starting to forget how she smelled, I’m starting to forget a lot of things and that kills me sometimes. 

Say goodbye to her while she can still understand, tell her everything you want to tell her. Tell her how much you love her, how much she means to you. It’s not a definite goodbye yet, but that way you won’t regret not telling her after it’s too late. I didn’t do it and that’s my biggest regret ever. 

It’s going to be rough in the beginning. For me it felt like she was away on vacation and she could walk through the front door any second. And then it hit me, that’s not going to happen. She won’t be here for so many things that are going to happen in my life that she should be here for. When that happened I crashed. It took me a couple of months to deal with it, but now I’m at peace with it. I know now that she’s relieved of all the pain and misery she went through and even though she’s not with me physically, I know she’s watching over me and of course she always continues to live on inside my heart. Just know that she’ll always be there, no matter how much time has passed. 

I’m happy to hear you have family and friends to support you. Take your time to grieve, alone or together with them. Keep strong.",1

1001,"When my mom was going through it I was in my senior year of high school and transitioning into college. I really regret not spending more time with her or being more proactive with texting her, visiting her, and so on. I think I didn’t actually believe she would die. 

If I were back in that position, I would definitely try to make her life as easy as possible. I would talk with her, cook with her, and treasure that time better. I also wish I took more videos and pictures together because my memory is bad and I can’t remember what she sounds like without hearing a recording. 

I think you should know that it really hurts and is a struggle after she passes, but it does get easier over time. Although unless I’m emotionally prepared to talk or think about her, I will get pretty emotional.",1
1002,"I was 11 when my mom passed & 29 when my dad followed. I miss the conversations & laughter terribly. Take the time to ask everything you’ve ever been curious about & inquire about family history. So much information passes with them & there’s not always a way to fill in the blanks. Take pictures! I have a handful of old rolls of film that I’ve been slowly developing & I always hope there’s a new/old pic of my dad that I get to rediscover. 

I know someone said record conversations & that’s great to have. I had a few voicemails that I’d listen to when I needed to hear my dads voice. But one day technology failed me & they were wiped from the saved system. Cherish those & make a back up of the back up if you always want to hear her voice. I didn’t, but I took it as my dad telling me that it was time to let go of that part of him. I still hear his voice clearly in my mind either way. 

Mostly, just make everyday count. <3",1
1003,"Spend as much time with her as possible. Always greet her with a kiss and say goodbye whenever you leave, just in case. Tell her right now what a wonderful mother she was. Never think you’ll say it another time. Ask for her last bit of advice. Talk about your favorite family memories. And write down as many recipes as she can remember. Ask her right now what she wants after she dies. If she’s cremated does she want to be scattered, and where? What kind of funeral does she want? Do it now while she can still make these choices. It’ll be hard, and awkward, but do it. Ask her what she thinks the afterlife will be like. The vision of it in your head will probably change as she approaches death and after she passes. I’m not sure where you all are in the process, but talk about hospice and caregivers. If you can, I’d recommend having someone stay overnight. We weren’t able to do that, and I think it has some trade offs, but I think it might be worth it. Remember it’s your job to be a daughter, and I hope you don’t have to take on the role of a nurse or anything. Get to know the people who work for hospice. Ask them questions. Consider joining support groups. Tell your friends what’s going on, and be prepared to let some people go. Most people won’t know what to say or do. Some people will be terrible friends. A few people will grow very close to you. Take care of yourself. Do whatever you need to get out of bed every day and do something. It’s okay if you feel numb for a long time too. Read some books about it. I liked “what to do when I’m gone” as well as “the Tibetan book of living and dying.” I know nothing is okay right now, but it will pass.",1
1004,"The things that have been a blessing to me from my time with Mama before she passed... 

I had time to really get to know her as a person.  We would talk to the wee hours of the morning and she told me story after story from her life.


I recorded videos of her singing our favorite nursery rhymes that I watch all the time. They are very comforting.. especially if I am sick or had a bad day.


Pictures.  Lots of pictures.  Even ones that you don't think you would like to have later.  Things look different once everything is done.

She taught me to cook her signature dishes her way over an intercom.  I am now often called on by my siblings to make 'Mama's Pot Roast'.

Some of my most pleasant memories of her final months (besides talking) were clipping coupons together on Sundays, using a video chat to 'take' her outside to check on her flower beds and look around, and watching her favorite shows with her.

Be prepared for some bad times, too.  There were a couple of times I had to step away because Mama became so mean and resentful to me (very out of character).  She also didn't like me to leave her side and it would get claustrophobic sometimes.  There was also a brief period where she didn't know who I was and would scream and throw things at me... fortunately she came back to normal.

Smell her.  Feel her skin.  Hug her and really be present.",1

My biggest regret with my dad was that i was so young, (13), I didn't think he would actually pass away even when he was in hospice, so I always assumed we had more time when we didn't. I wonder if my dad knew how much I loved him, because I was too scared and in denial to say it.",1
1006,"My Mom passed away due to metastatic breast cancer when I was 9 and my brother was 7.. my Mom was 28.. she knew she was terminally Ill for about 3 months before she passed.. my brother and I were never told until that awful day came.. my Dad tried to encourage her to write letters for us to read as we got older, but unfortunately she couldn't accept that she was dying and never did it.. I wish with all my heart that she could have brought herself to do it, but I understand that she was not able to.. my heart breaks when I think about how she must have been feeling, both physically and mentally, during that time.. I do remember her voice saying certain things, and I remember her cackle laugh haha! She was an only child to my widowed grandmother.. years later when my grandmother was dying (also of metastatic breast cancer), I sat with her in the hospital for the most part of her last 3 days.. the things I learned about her in that time was far and beyond any stories I had ever heard before.. with no medication of any kind, she basically relived her life verbally to me, but seemingly unaware that all the events were already lived.. I went on to have 6 kids of own, and I have spent their lives telling them stories, sharing my likes, dislikes, childhood experiences and feelings.. it was important to  me that they knew many of the things I knew about my Mom and how those things stayed with me my whole life.. also, I ask them all the time these same sorts of things about themselves.. I usually know everyone's current favourite things, like colour, food, things to do.. I put a large emphasis on sharing these seemingly mundane details about each other.. in the end, none of it is mundane.. it's all part of what makes us special to our loved ones..

1007,"Write things down.
You’ll think you’ll remember things about the time you’ve had together, but you won’t & it will be blurred with grief.

Tell her what you think, feel. Ask her what you want to know. Treat her as normally as you can - if you usually go to your mom for help, keep doing so. She isn’t dead yet. I know it sometimes feel you have to prepare yourself for life without her & that can feel as though you are protecting yourself and her too, but you’ll hold regrets you didn’t enjoy being able to complain about your day or ask her for help while she was still here and after she was diagnosed.

Talk. Talk. Talk. Talk about your fears, about hers. Talk about what her dying plans are and what she wants. Talk about her funeral or what service she would like. Get documents in order. Organising all of this shit when you’re lost in grief in the early days after loss is fucking horrible and having things organised as much as you can before hand helps smooth the process.

Ask her to write to you. Don’t open it until after she’s gone. It will be devastating and comforting all rolled into one when you get to read it, but you’ll treasure it. 

Understand that people will say shitty things. Or they won’t say anything because they won’t know what to say, so they avoid you instead. Be prepared and surround yourself with people who love you.

Get help - palliative help, cancer nurses/charities. There is usually help available - accept it. 

Ask her stupid questions you’ll think you’ll never want the answer to. What was she scared of growing up? Who was her first love? How did she feel about her parents when she was young? How did she feel when she got pregnant with you? Did she breast feed? Silly stuff. You’ll want the answers one day. And even if you don’t get all the answers, bonding and sharing can’t be a bad thing.

Be there with her as often as you can, but try to keep hold of some semblance of normal life. Have a bath, get a shower every day, have a walk. Little stuff like that; but don’t put pressure on yourself. 

If she’s well enough tick off aspects of her bucket list. My mother’s was to dye her hair purple and then shave her had. She wanted a tattoo too but couldn’t get it due to chemo (& at that point she was treatable, until she wasn’t and it was too late). 

Take photos. Even if she feels and looks like shit, even if you do. Take them. 

Be prepared that death isn’t like you see in the movies. People die differently. Get some support.

My mother died 4 years ago from lymphoma when she was 52 and I was 23. My dad died aged 60 when I was 24. My mum was a Palliative Nurse and the greatest lesson she left me with was how to prepare to die and how to die & what I should do afterwards. 

The biggest regret I have is that I don’t have a picture of her hands. I think about her hands and how soft they were and how when I was unwell she would stroke my head and place her cool hand on my forehead. When I saw her in the chapel of rest I couldn’t see her hands and it haunts me that I don’t remember them in detail.",1
1008,"My mom passed of cancer March 30th, 2019.   All three of us, her sons, were staying with her in her final weeks, and she died at home.  I'm very glad she could go that way, with her sons around her, at home. She was in very good shape until a few weeks before the end.   The last few weeks she was very fuzzy, on pain meds, and in pain from swelling in her feet, often unable to sleep unless really doped up on pain meds.   We did have ""hospice care"" which amounted to a visit once a day by some workers who helped her shower and etc.  She had some kind of insurance policy that should have paid for more help but they weaseled out of it.  (Check on anything like that, especially get a copy of the contract, then talk to your lawyer or accountant and see what it provides.)

I don't regret that we did it this way, but.... when my time comes I want to be put in a facility where the family can visit but there will be qualified personnel to take care of me, so there's less stress on family.   This might be something to discuss with her beforehand, and if she wants to go that route then start looking into it as soon as possible.

Other thoughts.  Record her voice/video and her stories about the family history.   Likewise, if there are family heirlooms lying around it's a good idea to get her on video explaining their history.  If there is anything that might be contentious about the inheritance, get it sorted out and might as well get that on video too, maybe visit an accountant with her  to discuss things.  (My father and my aunt on that side had a major disagreement when their mother died and as a result I grew up not knowing my aunt.  My mother's biggest worry is that something like that would happen between her kids.)   If she uses a computer or anything like that, get her passwords to her computer, email, etc.  Learn about her bills, in fact it'd probably be a good idea to start managing them for her.  Learn about her life insurance, annuities, etc, if she has any, you'll need to contact them after she passes and deal with them.  (Another good reason to get an accountant.)   

Think ahead about what to do about clearing out her house, especially where to put any heirloom furniture.  My mom cleaned out a bunch of stuff prior to her passing, but that was the kind of person she was, it might not be something your mom can deal with.  In the weeks after she was gone, my brothers and I did a pretty good job, under the circumstances, of cleaning out a bunch of her stuff (clothing, books) , but all of the furniture is still sitting there because we haven't gotten it together enough to move it out and into storage or something.  I think we're avoiding it.  It's not pleasant being at her house.",1
1009,"My grandma died about three years ago. She died sooner than expected after being diagnosed with liver cancer. She had her body donated, so there was no funeral or viewing to pay my respects and say my final goodbyes. I felt bad about it for so long until I realized she wouldn’t want me to be sad about it. 


After I was done grieving, I went out of my way to find every picture I had of her. Read every birthday card (or cards in general). I preserved every email, text message, and other forms of contact I had with her. I regrettably don’t have any videos or recordings of her. 


It was from this experience that I decided to do the same with my mom (whom is still alive). When she’s leaves a voicemail, I now save them and store them in multiple locations in case anything fails. I have a photo album dedicated to her whenever I’m able to snap a picture of her. I’ve started writing down recipes she has. I try to spend as much time with her as I can. Save all the cards and letters. I even have a playlist of artists and bands that she likes. Just little stuff that you don’t realize is that important until its gone. 


I’m currently in my mid-twenties and my mom is 52, and I think she’ll be around for a while, but it never hurts to prepare for the inevitable. My grandma passed when she was 68. I never thought she would leave so soon, but she did. I won’t tell you it’s easy or hard, or what to do, how to feel... because everyone prepares and grieve in their own way. I just hope you’re able to find a way to be with her and remember her in the best way you can.",1
1010,"Yes, this.  My mom passed away from breast cancer when I was fifteen, back in the early 2000's and before smartphones meant you had every opportunity to record something.  We only have one snippet of a clip where she's talking to me at my fifteenth birthday.  That's the ONLY recording we have of her voice because my stepdad threw all the old home videos (taken before he was in the picture) out when she died.

I have scoured our basement, every box, every nook, and cranny trying to here more than her saying, ""Hey, Rivlet, do your friends...should you guys go..."" before the video cuts out.

It's been fifteen years and while I can sort of remember her voice, I miss her still and wish I had more.  Pictures, voice recordings, memories.  It'd also be nice to have something to show my kids because, to be honest, words will never do her justice.",1
1011,"Oh my god, you have me crying. This is sad but also so beautiful. I was really close with my grandma and I always imagined I'd have one of these endings with her. Being there with her in the last moments, being able to tell how much she meant to me. But unfortunately she was taken suddenly with a heart attack all alone. It's makes me so sad that she couldn't have this type of death. I'm not trying to say your mom was lucky to die, but I think very few of us really get a proper farewell like this and it feels like a very peaceful and resolute way to go. Your mother was lucky to have a child who loved her as much as you did. She must have been an excellent mother.",1
1012,"I came here to say this 👆🏼So glad I spent that time with her even though it was hard to watch her dying. If you can handle it, actually be there when she passes. I am so glad I was able to be there for her and in a lot of ways it helped me process, though it was later. You will never get over it. Life will never be the same. But time will lessen the pain little by little, and you’ll be able smile again when you talk about her. 
Next month will be 5 years since my mom passed and I still have days when I cry because I miss her so much. But most of the time I can smile about her instead of crying. Every once in a while I still get the urge to call her, just out of the blue, and I can smile because I think that means she is saying hi to me. Letting me know she is near me.

Nathaniel
  By Patrick Phillips.

Whatever it was
    that made the Reverend
        Barker stoop that way,

it meant no matter
    how much he screamed
        at my friend Nathaniel

for being late, for not
    raking the leaves,
        or for raking the goddamned

leaves the wrong Goddamned way
    (his huge, gin-blossomed jowls
        quivering with rage,

his great whale-eyes
    lost in the gray
        depths of his brow),

he could only ever scowl
    at the tops of his wingtip shoes
        or at the cuffs of the black wool suit

he always seemed to be wearing
    when he’d thunder into the yard,
        or down the stairs,

or through the little speaker
    of some payphone
        we huddled around, God

damnit Nathaniel, I told you,
    I told you, Nathaniel, Goddamnit!
        his fury repeating itself

so precisely it became a joke
    we hollered through the halls,
        changing my friend’s name

to Goddamnit Nathaniel, as in
    Where the hell’s Goddamnit Nathaniel?
        I told you, Goddamnit, to get me a Coke!

which was stupid but funny at fourteen,
    and still just as stupidly funny at nineteen,
        when we’d yell across a bonfire,

Don’t bogart that joint, Goddamnit
    Nathaniel. Haven’t I told you
        to pass the fucking bong when you’re through?

which is still funny to me even now—
    even though I look back and see,
        as I could not have seen then,

that the Reverend Barker
    only stooped that way
        because he was dying,

because cancer was eating his liver,
    and because with each day it became
        both more urgent and more unlikely

that he would ever manage to say
    whatever it was he meant
        when he’d sit at the kitchen table,

or grip the black phone,
    or stand in the darkened driveway
        after we’d all gone home,

staring at the ground and saying nothing
    to his sweet, beloved boy
        but Goddamnit

Nathaniel, listen to me.
    Listen Goddamnit.
        Goddamnit Nathaniel, now listen.",1

Silly Old Baboon by Spike Milligan

There was once was a baboon
Who one afternoon
Said I think I will fly to the sun
So with two great palms
strapped to his arms
he started his takeoff run

Mile after mile
He galloped in style
But never once left the ground
You’re going too slow said a passing crow
Try reaching the speed of sound

SO
he put on a spurt
My God how it hurt
both the soles of his feet caught on fire
As he went through a stream
There were great clouds of steam
But he still never got any higher

On and on through the night
both his knees caught alight
clouds of smoke billowed out of his rear!!!
Quick to his aid
Came the fire brigade
who chased him for over a year

Many moons passed by
Did Baboon ever fly
Did he ever get to the sun?
I’ve just heard today,
he’s well on his way
He’ll be passing through Acton at one",1
1018,"I don't think I've hit a ""lowest"" point in my life but in general I feel on the low. It is a constant kinda. I am mediocre - did not achieve many things, and even if I did - I half-assed them. My personal life currently is kind of not-existent, I feel tired all the time and not enjoying stuff. Friends come and go in my life. Work is constant, and it keeps increasing (especially now, due to COVID). I struggle with waking up and keeping a positive outlook on life. 

But I'm giving my best to battle it - I track my positive and negative habits, I try to do the bare minimum of sports and be active, so I get a bit of endorphins. It might be at home but it is something and I'm glad as hell I'm doing it. Also eating regularly and cuddling my cat, caring for her are helpful too. I've taken up a few hobbies and I try to be glad about the progress I'm making.

During the finals of the finance paper, the paper was particularly tough and its different. I came out of the hall crying out loud because I was afraid of failing the paper even tho i managed to fill up all my answers. When the results came out, it was no surprise that this subject got me a pass but it dragged my CGPA down (i was putting a lot of effort to increase my CGPA before i graduate).

After that semester, I started my internship for 6 months until March 2018. I was working on weekdays and attending classes on weekends. I told myself to come back even stronger to prove that I was not easily defeated.

Fast forward, as my internship ended, I managed to pass two professional papers at a rather good marks. Also, for the next two semesters my name was in Dean's List and President's List respectively. Nobody knew how hard I studied my ass off to get the goal I wanted.

I managed to pass my professional papers in 2 years  (Mid 2017 to Dec 2019) and I'm currently an affiliate and working at a company that I have always desired for.

Lesson of the story: Always come back stronger!",1

He was working in AV full time last year, making decent money, but he wasn't loving it, and he kept saying he how much he would love to talk about sports all day for a career. So I found him this program and we've been making it work financially. 

The program took a trip to Florida in the spring and he interviewed an up-and-coming MLB player. He wrote a really great article about it and it was published on Sportsnet. He FaceTimed me after and couldn't stop smiling. He was so humble about it that he could hardly believe it happened.

1026,"It was recommended to me by an orthodontist, another said just lower surgery..  but I passed on both.  You're brave for going through that - I've read a lot about it and seen videos.

Try to keep busy as much as you can - books, tablet with internet, music, even keeping a blog of your progress can help...  stay in touch with friends and accept any help that comes your way.

From what I've heard, the swelling will go down and you will get your strength back..  it just takes a while.  This is MAJOR surgery and it's a lot to deal with.

Make sure you're taking in enough calories - smoothies fortified with protein poweder, peanut butter, full fat milk..  are all great (assuming your tummy is up for it).  If you can, take a very slow walk outside or sit in your backyard, just to get some air..  it will help with your mood.

Your end result will be amazing.  I've seen pictures.  People won't really know what's been done, you'll just look..  better and healthier.  Facial balance can make a big difference and you'll have the rest of your life to enjoy it.

Can I ask if you have an underbite / overbite?

My issue is an overbite and tiny lower jaw.  Like I mentioned, I opted out of surgery and am working with an excellent orthodontist who will do what he can with my jaw structure.  If I'm still unhappy at the end, I may look into a chin implant.

I'm mostly okay with face-on views of my face, it's just the side profile that looks off to me.",1
1027,"I had double jaw surgery in February to fix my open bite and underbite. For me recovery was uncomfortable more than anything. 

I read some of your comments - swelling took a few months to completely go away but I felt like I looked human again at about three weeks, enough that no one in public would notice anything abnormal. At least until I tried to talk haha. The first week is the worst and you've already passed that milestone!

I still have partial numbness in some areas, and my upper gums are still completely numb.

Food was fun, I was on a liquid diet for 6 weeks. I actually didn't have soup that much so I didn't get sick of it! I had protein shakes with a banana blended in for breakfast, and soup or stew for lunch and dinner typically. I'd often blend up what my mum was having for dinner, watered or milked down so it could be syringed or sucked through a straw. Things like curry or bolognese were good. Canned stews and soups come in so many flavours now, chunky ones can easily be blended and watered down! I stayed away from anything with sugar in it for about three weeks until I felt I could clean my mouth properly. Also, eat foods high in fibre as soon as possible! Your bowels will thank you!

10 months later I am 100% happy with my decision to go through with jaw surgery. It has been totally worth it. I can eat properly and I look waaaaaay better than I did before.

Also, I made a blog to document my experience, let me know if you would like the link! Or if you have any questions. Good luck with your recovery, it should be all uphill from here :-)",1

1105,"Hello /r/AskWomen, I would like your help on getting some perspective on my situation.
The long story of this goes as follows: I have always been a chubby kid, and I adapted to my situation by putting on a thick skin and trying to be funny. In high school I was bullied by some people I had considered friends, and of course they would make fun of me for being fat. I believe this contributed to me developing a rather negative self-image, which put a damper on my ability to show interest and pursue relationships with the ladyfolk. Consequently, I have never had a serious relationship or any type of sexual contact, and I am 23 now. That situation is not good, in fact I would say it is very bad.


I think I sort of went into a downward spiral when I moved away from home to go to college and my bad consumption habits had free reign. I was at a personal worst last December: no job, out of shape, very fat, ate nothing but fast food, smoked a lot of pot, played games all day, and I was doing the bare minimum for my classes. I felt really unhealthy and I eventually had to confront myself and make some changes to avert impeding bodily disasters like a heart attack or diabetes


A few months prior to hitting rock bottom I had become friends with a rather peculiar but very cool young lady through shared our shared interest in marijuana. I think getting some perspective on her life made me realize how, well… pathetic I felt. She was a much better student than I, working an internship, in good physical shape, and just seemed to have her life in order. Even though she was three years younger than me, she had far surpassed me in overall life excellence. I considered her a remarkable individual and I had an interest in pursuing a romantic relationship with her, but it was apparent to me that she was out of my league. On the 1-10 scale I estimated her to be a solid 8 and I was like a 4. With such a disparity of apparent worth it seemed it would be inappropriate and rude for me to make any non-platonic advances towards her. 


But still, I felt like we had really good mental chemistry and she was like everything I could want out of a romantic partner. We are both very logical, analytical, well read, cultured, sophisticated as fuck, sarcastic, slightly evil, and somewhat conceited. With these traits, I don’t think either of us often meet people we really click with. With a lot of people I feel like even when they are present I am mentally alone, and I believe she feels the same way.


Anyways, starting in January I made some changes, started eating healthier, started exercising, and really tried to grow as a person and cultivate a better life for myself. I have sworn off soda, snack foods, fast food, started running daily, working out at the gym, and just spending more time outside and less time on the internets. I have lost a lot of weight since then, I’ve dropped ~75lbs and gained some muscle mass. Friends and family frequently comment on how I’m looking great now, which is sort of uncomfortable for me but still very cool. I felt really unattractive before, but I like what I see in the mirror now. I would say my lady friend inspired me to strive for greater personal excellence, and I would like to tell her about this.


I would say I’ve been working on my body image as a means to work up the nerve to ask her out, so for me there has been a lot of build-up to this. About a week ago I got drunk while we were hanging out and I made a pass at her by saying something to the effect that I find her very cool and very attractive, and she reciprocated by saying she thinks I am pretty cool and she values our plutonic friendship. I am wondering if I should tell her just how deep my feelings go, and the effect she has had on me, or if I should take what seems to be a very clear social cue that she is not interested in me in that way and let it go. So I turn it over to you, /r/AskWomen, how would you respond if you were put into a similar situation?



TL;DR: Developed a crush on a friend, used that as motivation to lose weight and improve self-image. 75lbs of weight loss later I politely make a pass at her, and am politely turned down. Want to know if I should press further and let her know what’s up, or take the hint, let it go, and move on?

1106,"Hi there lovely ladies,

I'm a 20 year old female and it's been a month (exactly) since my boyfriend of 1.5 years broke up with me. 
I've gone through the motions and confusions, and I don't really know what to think or how to go about this. He's mentioned that he's open to the idea of getting back together but it'll take some time, and not only just that. 
Basically our relationship ending was a snowball effect. It started with the complete lack of sexual intimacy (from my side). I personally have never had a sexual libido, and he had a very high one. This was major problem number one. Also I'm on the pill and have been diagnosed with Vaginismus in the past year, after a very painful first sexual experience with him. 
Also I tended to lie quite a lot, especially about sex and stuff. One of my main lies was that I was supposed to use a dilator -to help my vaginismus- and i lied to him for 4 months straight before I finally came out with the truth. This completely destroyed him emotionally and he said that that was the point he knew this wasn't going to work out. The sexual side went with the lying.
I don't understand him at the moment, he still has feelings for me, but sometimes it's just...as though he never wants to rekindle anything. He always touches my legs/kisses my hand or face or tries to show he still cares. He even has still the password on his phone as my nickname. Once he even spun me around and cuddled me very affectionately. It's like he's trying to still show some affection but also being very cold at the same time. I've actually taken to not phoning or contacting him first now, but he always comes through first. Also he mentions things that are a bit hurtful like today we were passing an art store and he just said randomly ""thats where I got the paper for your love-heart for valentines day. It cost so much per piece.'' I was just like ""why do you need to say that?""
Also yesterday, he said ""don't tag me in your Facebook status about seeing Catching Fire..because you know...It'll look weird and I don't want people to see that we are together."" That really fucking hurt. I was really put off for the rest of the night after that. He just brings up shit like that all the time without me even mentioning the relationship. If anything, I want to forget and move on, but he keeps bringing it up. He then apologised for this when I brought it up. 

At the moment, I guess I'm pretty upset, because he's gone all cold and distant and I just want to be with him so much. He was the loveliest guy, amidst the panic attacks and severe OCD. 
He told me the other day he has no interest in fixing our problems that we had with the relationship, and he'd rather work on a friendly, happy friendship. The problem is, I'll always want more out of him than a friendship. We never had sex (thanks to me...) and I feel I really missed the boat there with him because he was such a loving, patient and caring boyfriend. I've said to him I'm prepared to work through things, even if he isn't, but atm he just seems to be blocking everything and also being really negative about any future. 'Sorry it's really not going to work.' whilst hugging me tightly and also kissing my hand, it's just confusing. He thinks that if we got back together, the same problems would just arise and it would be a wasted effort. Urgh! I just wish I had some hope of something, but I know he's trying not to give me 'false hope.' 

Is this normal guy behaviour? Has this happened to any of you ladies before?  

I've told him I'm actually doing the dilators now and he's very happy with that. Also going to see a psych about my lying, so I am damn well solving my problems! :) 

Long story short, how many of you women have rekindled the relationship after taking a break? How long did it take? How did you do it? 
Thanks! ",1
1107,"Please forgive the novel, I'm just gonna kinda put everything on the table. It's seriously way too long of a post.

My gf and I (m) are both 26. We've been dating for about a year and a half.

We had always had a lot of mutual friends, before we dated, but we were never single at the same time, and never saw each other that often. By the time we did start to see each other, I had just finished pulling myself out of a pretty rough place. I didn't have a job, but I had saved up a ton of money from my previous job, I lived on my own, I was in a good place, and super confident. This attracted her to me, and I started laying it on pretty thick, and before long we were hooking up.

In the beginning, it was insane how much we clicked. We had similar dreams and ambitions, it was so easy for us to get comfortable around each other, we went out all the time, we had sex constantly. She, essentially, never left my place. I had had a rough couple of years before this, and I kinda just gave myself to it. We fell head over heels for each other in no time.

She ended up getting her own place, after spending maybe a month or two constantly at mine. I helped her move in, and then I just.... never left. A few months later, I got rid of my apartment. There just wasn't any sense, despite how quickly the relationship moved, that there would be any drama down the road.

And there wasn't, for a loooong time. Things were great. They were amazing.

I fucked up, though. I really never wanted that first summer to end. I wanted to keep doing things with her, I wanted to lounge with her, and I didn't really wanna do anything else. I don't think I was ever overtly clingy. She could go out and do her own thing, do things with her friends on her own, whatever, none of it bothered me, as long as we still did things together.

I gave a half-hearted attempt at a new job (which I still didn't really *need*, but that time would come). I gave a half-hearted attempt at school (which I do need, but I have serious trouble motivating myself to keep at it). In time, I really just became... a slob, I guess. Not a slob, literally. I cleaned the apartment, I took care of myself, I still showed exuberant gestures of love, but I was just always home. I didn't even make much of an effort with my friends unless my girlfriend made plans with them.

This went on... for longer than I'd like to admit. My girlfriend started pulling away. It was our rapport that made us fall in love, but the things about me that attracted her to me in the first place just didn't exist anymore.

She started to pull away. She went out with her friends, without me, almost constantly. We would be silent while she was home. Eventually she started staying the night out frequently. This started to weigh heavily on me. I hadn't put two and two together, I didn't get that I was becoming that roommate that's always in the living room that you can't avoid, I just didn't understand why she didn't want to go out with me anymore, or lounge with me. This has been going on for several weeks now, and it's been seriously eating away at me, and as opposed to motivating me, which it should have, it just drained me. I just stayed at home, feeling sorry for myself.

Anyway, onto this week. We had had a plan, several months ago, that at some point down the road, I'd move out for 6 months or so, so she could have a crack at living on her own, something she hasn't gotten the chance to experience. Anyway, this week, after seeing her for all of maybe an hour in the past day or two, she comes home, and she tells me that we need to move up the timetable, that I really need to get out of the apartment, because she feels uncomfortable coming home, and thus distracted from her responsibilities.

She never outright said we were breaking up, and she even said that she thought it would improve the relationship, but everything about the discussion... it just felt like a break-up to me. I am not, in any way, opposed to the idea of moving out. Looking back, now, on the past several months, I'm humiliated. I still gave her nice gifts, I still pulled my weight at home, but I just didn't give her space while she was here, and I didn't have a life while she wasn't.

Anyway, another day or two passes, and I'm just... in really bad shape, but things are still pleasant (though I still hardly see her). She gets home, and we have another talk. This talk, I'm acknowledging what's been going on, and the burden I've been. I'm going to move out as soon as possible, I'm gonna get work, I'm gonna land on my feet. But, I still love her, I still wanna be a part of her life, I want to help her succeed. I want her to have her own space, and I wanna be my own man. It would be our chance to date each other, because we totally skipped that part of a relationship. This discussion went pretty well. It ended with an exchange of ""I love you""s, a hug, and a kiss.

If that had been where it ended, I would be happy, but... I seriously fucked up this time. We had had plans for a while to see a movie yesterday, and I had given her loads of outs, but she still wanted to. The plan was, I was gonna clean the apartment, then she was gonna come home and we'd see the movie, then I was gonna spend the night at a friend's place so she could have a good time at the apartment without me.

I kinda... had a panic attack yesterday. I cleaned the apartment, and just... I've been pretty inside my head lately and I was just suddenly overwhelmed by the idea that I was cleaning an apartment, one that I knew so intimately, but I was a stranger to it. And I thought about all the good times or whatever, and I'm just assaulting myself with ""She's over it, dude. Give up. She's probably already seeing someone else you fucking moron."" It totally wasn't one of my prouder moments, and I was ready to just ignore it, but then I call her, just to ask what time she wanted to see the movie, and she doesn't, her friends want to go out right away once she's done with school. The maximum amount of time I had seen her at once all week was, maybe, about 40 minutes.

That just totally broke me. I brought her the keys to the apartment, and I was kinda teary-eyed, and I just told her that I was gonna be out all weekend, and I was gonna move out at the beginning of next week, and I just couldn't deal with staying in that apartment anymore. She looked totally stunned, and just said, ""I thought we had a good talk the other day."" And it just ended with her saying she'd talk to me later.

I left, and I tried to make plans with friends, but it was last minute, and I ended up sleeping in a hotel.

When I woke up, I was.... totally mortified about how I had acted. I ended up coming home, right before my girlfriend was leaving for lunch, and I apologized and said I was embarrassed and what have you, and she said it was fine. It was pleasant, but... yeah, after my pity-party yesterday, it was just different. It was just... cold, I guess. She went out to lunch, and I think she had plans to stay out tonight anyway. She might come home before then, but I don't even know if it'd be... a good thing. I feel like what I did yesterday just totally invalidates the discussion we had a few days ago. We're gonna see the movie tomorrow, but at the end of the day, and I really wouldn't be surprised if I didn't see her until then.

I'd like to think that the picture I've painted of myself in this post is less flattering than the reality, because I'm obviously in rough shape right now. I mean, I get along with all of her friends and family amazingly, I'm witty, attractive, whatever. This is the person I've been, though. And I'm really breaking down because I don't have anyone to talk to about it. All I can manage to say about her to my friends is how cool and great I think she is, and how much I love her, and I just cringe to think what she tells her friends about me.

Sorry, this went on entirely too long.

**tl;dr - My girlfriend asked me to move out, and I've handled it really, reeaally poorly. Is there any hope, upon my departure, for reconciliation? Or have I spent too long showing her nothing but the absolute worst side of me?**",1
1108,"(this will probably end up long winded and run-on so TL;DR will be at the end. im gunna do my best to side both sides of this as to not make her out to be a bad person... after all every story has two sides)

**Side A:** 
I've been with my GF now for a little over a year (14 months to be exact) and things have been if not great certainly manageable. we (21m and 20f) rarely ever fight and on the very rare occasion we do, its resolved quickly since we tend to be open minded and willing to negotiate. The problem here lies in a few things... First of all my gf has a pretty prominent communication problem. I'm the guy who stresses communication pretty seriously in a relationship and she seems to have a much more blurry perception of the grey area specifically between 'taking one for the team' and 'neglecting to confront'. 99 times out of 100 this isn't a huge issue and doesn't cause a problem with us. The problem here is that over time (lets say 6months~ on) she seems to have grown distant and become less interested in me. Our sex life became virtually non existent (breaks of 1-2 months aren't uncommon even right now we're almost 2 months into a dry spell), as compared to fooling around almost daily and sex would be a few times a week. She seems a lot less comfortable saying 'i love you' in person and over all less willing to see each other 'just because' (ie outside of planned meetings or necessity) part of me understands that to some small extent these things tend to happen during a relationship at random points/intervals and im willing to accept that and move past it. My problem is it all APPEARS (see part B to see other end of this argument) these all started changing after her ex showed back up. Our get together was a tad complicated because said Ex is a very close friend of mine (was before their break up and still remains so). She and He broke up over falling apart and they both kinda saw the inevitability of it. Shortly after (less than a week) she and i got together and tried to keep the relationship on the down low for His sake (not to hide it per say but in respect of his feelings since we both still cared about him to an extent). Now i (as well as her closest friend) are convinced that he isn't over her as much as he could be and its in the realm of possibility he's trying to regain ground with their relationship. I've done my best to give her/them their privacy as far as their friendship, but lately i've been skeptical. I just dont feel like she feels the same way about me anymore and that she in a sense isn't pulling her weight in the relationship anymore...

**Side B:** 
She has a lot of stress in her life be it her parents current and 'less than clean' divorce thats in the process, her full time work schedule and full time school schedule. i COMPLETELY empathize with her on this and give her the appropriate space to work, relax, and be comfortable- while still retaining a healthy relationship. As far as the sex life goes- said Best friend mentioned before told me that this low sex drive is nothing new, and WAS prevalent during her previous relationship with said Ex. And as stated above i accept that feelings might tend to dull a little after time, and maybe she is getting a little too 'comfortable' with our relationship and is letting her belt loose a bit. And as mentioned above- she has an issue with expressing emotions and im willing to accept/work with that.  Also, i admit whole-heartedly admit i have a mild jealous side. i say mild not to downplay it but im not that horribly controlling person that pulls his girlfriend by the wrist around town, but i DO feel like she's too good for me, and belongs with someone better- thus making me insecure and jealous. Finally she hasn't done anything to me or previous Ex to prove any type of cheating going on.  

The tricky part is her ex. I get the impression (though she has never come out and said it) Mr Ex was VERY manipulative in their relationship. To the point that she doesnt know how to properly have sex (she acts as if she was instructed by Ex to 'just sit there and let him take care of it') and these occurrences have crippled her sex drive, self esteem, and emotional contact. I admit our relationship would probably be a lot less rocky and more stable if he were out of the picture entirely, but i dont think that's possible given our group of friend and the fact that i dont want that held over my head that 'i made her give up a friend for me etc etc' and even though i dont think she's the kinda girl to do that- you cant be too careful ya know?

So my final question after giving you ALL this information is: how do i approach her about these feelings? How can i tell her i feel a little neglected and one-sided without implicating shes the bad guy and responsible for all our trouble? On the converse, how can i approach the fact that i feel like Ex really screwed with her head and for the better of our relationship and more-so herself, she needs to confront it? and finally how can i confront her about not being so comfortable with her current friendship with Ex without sounding overbearing and jealous? 

**TL;DR** Girlfriend seems more distant and possibly losing interest in my over Ex, and has deep rooted problems that affect important parts of our relationship. Am i over reacting, or am i justified? if so, how can i approach these subject without attacking her, while still keeping her feelings in mind?

1110,"I recently (about a month back) stopped using oral contraception, after being on it for about 4-5 years (I'm 21 now, I was about 16 when I got on the pill). So my last period was also about a month back. Using pill made it so I always knew when to expect my period (how many pills left + 2-4 days, and my period would last about 4 days) and I became pretty complacent about keeping track of things in a more organised fashion (before that I used calendars and tried to meticulously record everything). Now that I'm off it, I don't know what to expect. I really dread getting my period unexpectedly, especially since they tended to be extremely painful and make it impossible for me to go about my day. That was under control while on the pill (worst case scenario, I'd be off my feet for only a day. If I couldn't get rest, I'd be able to work through it with a lot of painkillers).   
  
Pain management was primarily why I was initially prescribed the pill. Some days it would be so bad, I would just pass out while at school or just randomly on the road. Of course I stayed on the pill when I became sexually active (irrespective of condom use), seeing as it was still mainly the way for me to manage my pain, plus added safety. But for various reasons, I have now decided to go off it and see how it works. I am in a committed LTR, but my SO's work and mine makes it so we spend a some months each year, every year on different sides of the continent. We have been together 3 years, and don't expect our living scenario to change in the near future. So for a good part of the year, I'm on the pill for no other reason than because I take it when we're together. I've severe migraine issues, and my neurologist was concerned the OCP was interacting negatively with my medication (which mostly works, but I'll have a bad episode every now and then). He suggested I try other contraception to see if my headaches improved. So to that effect the gynaecologist I went to (not the same person who prescribed the pill, and it will not be possible to visit her again) suggested I stay off the pill when I'm not sexually active, if I did not want to rely on condoms alone (I am pretty confident I will not ""fall out"" of the habit of taking a pill, as I've literally never missed a pill in the years I was on it).  Regarding pain she said that now that I'm older things might be different/improved on that front, and that when younger my pain and subsequent symptoms (passing out, etc) were likely exacerbated by a congenital cardiac defect that I no longer have (been operated on successfully). She just said I should continue to rely on the pain medication I had been taking, except now that was all I'd have. She did have me get an ultrasound and also examined me physically, and everything is normal. 
  
So yeah, I think I've covered the facts of my situation, but I'll edit/reply to clarify if not. I'm not worried about being pregnant, I'm worried about well, getting my period. I feel like I'm 14 again. Any anecdotes, advice, really anything. The longer it gets, the more worried I am about possibilities like passing out while I'm at work or school, grossly underestimating how often I need to change, etc.",1

1112,"Body acceptance has been a big message, and it’s the type of message that’s really in my wheelhouse. Yet, I’ve struggled intensely with it, because I want to believe it and I want to get there myself… but I just can’t when it comes to being overweight. I do believe that being happy is an essential key to maintaining a healthy weight (negative reinforcement creates eating disorders and psychological problems, not health!), but as much as I’ve sat with myself and improved my mindset, I don’t love my fat. I’ve removed the psychological blocks that kept me from doing things that I want “until I’m thin”:  I have a good relationship, I enjoy exercise, clothes and sex. But I still view my belly as something that needs to be fixed. I don’t love my body. The simple truth is it’s uncomfortable to be overweight. I sweat. My jeans chafe against my stomach. Sometimes the arms of seats poke into my thighs, sometimes the tables at booths press into my stomach. I might avoid a rickety looking stool or chair if I’m not sure that it can support my weight. My shoes wear out faster and sometimes I hurt my ankle or knee just from being active it a normal way, like walking to work. I don’t currently have any health issues (blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol), but I know my risks will increase with age. I don’t hate my body. I think I’m pretty cute. I believe my partner when he tells me I’m sexy. I can sustain more activity than you might think from looking at me, I love walking everywhere and stairs don’t wind me. I don’t feel self conscious walking down the street. I’m okay now shopping at plus size stores for clothes that fit me well. I don’t binge or hide eating like I used to. I meet new people, I travel. I'm not perfect, but I've improved my self esteem alot and overall really enjoy my life. But I don’t love my body… I don’t hate my body, is that okay end point? You’re never going to see a Dove ad with “Don’t hate your body” plastered in white cursive across the screen, it's just not the brightest message. But is it more realistic? Accepting being overweight isn’t the same as becoming okay with the mole on my face or the birthmark on my hip. It’s not like embracing pregnancy stretch marks, it’s not letting go of the idea of a six pack or certain size of clothing that my frame would never be. Accepting being overweight is accepting all the uncomfortable things that come with it and I don’t know if I can. Being overweight is something I can change and my life would probably be better for it (assuming I do it in a healthy way--both physically and psychologically. I’ve become thin through unhealthy means before and know, in and of itself, it doesn’t solve the problems you think it will when you’re overweight.)  I love the idea of treating people well, regardless of their looks. I love the idea of loving yourself. I love the idea of not holding yourself back. But, to me, saying love your overweight body is saying “settle” and I don’t love that. Is this spreading negativity, shooting myself in the foot? What do you think and how do you feel about body acceptance?",1

**Long strokes**= The guy pushes in deep and pulls almost all the way out to his head and then pushes all the way back in with each stroke/thrust of his penis

**Deep short strokes**= The guy pushes in deep and then just kind of rocks back and forth inside you only moving back and forth an inch or two at most so his penis is almost all inside the whole time he thrusts

**Shallow short strokes**= The guy puts his penis half way or less inside your vagina and doesn't really go any deeper. For an average size guy he only goes a few inches past his head and pulls almost all the way out before going back in during each stroke/thrust he makes

I like short and long hair on myself for different reasons, but where other people are concerned, I've noticed that having long hair is a constant conversation starter...for better or worse.  

I am currently in a long hair phase, and it seems like my hair is a magnet for unwanted attention.  I haven't felt comfortable wearing my hair down for a couple months now because it was getting to the point that *every single time* I wore it down, someone (both strangers and acquaintances) would stroke it and go on and on about it.  But even when it's tied up, people still reference it--- A few casual friends kind of sarcastically comment on it; when guys hit on me, they almost exclusively use comments on my hair as an opening line; my coworkers bring it up repeatedly to check in on whether I'm going to keep growing it out; a woman on the street asked me if I wanted to sell it; and another woman on the train was harassing me for an extra hair tie, claiming that I *must* have some because of how long my hair is.  All of that, and it's only a few inches past my shoulders, it's not like it is an exceptional length or anything.

It just strikes me as odd that as soon as my hair gets past a certain length, people start paying a shit ton of attention to it, whereas when it's shorter, it's just kind of a neutral part of my appearance.  Something about longer hair on me makes it an ""invitation"".  It's kind of weird, and I get tired of talking about my damn hair so much.

1139,"I've talked about it with her a couple of times before, but at the time my main reason was because I wanted shorter and less heavy periods. She's somewhat hesitant towards the idea because she's freaked out about the risk of stroke (even though the statistics are pretty low). She suggested an IUD, but I don't know if I'm comfortable with having it inserted, and they're typically not widely used by women my age anyways. 

Although I was sexually active when I first brought up the conversation, I've recently become closer with this guy and now I'm having sex way more often than before. We've had unprotected sex a few times, where he's just pulled out (I know, I know.. very bad). So basically pregnancy prevention is my main focus now. I mean it would still be nice to get the benefits of acne prevention, as well as shorter/less heavy periods.

So how should I go about this? Also, if you have any birth control suggestions/options that I can talk with her about, that would be great. Thank you!

**Sorry, error in title should be fixed now**

To kind of explain, I recently had a huge stroke of luck in many things and one of the things was a job with a certain professor, who to put it kindly, had a slip up with a student many years ago. As such recently I've overheard a few people talking about how I've gotten my position with him and so on. Ever since then I've been doubting myself, so to speak, as in are my opportunities really just because someone thinks I've got a nice face? Or am I really earning these positions with my grades and hard work? So ladies of AskWomen, how do you deal with this? How do you know what you've earned and not just received for being female?

1144,"So a friend of mine met this guy while playing an MMORPG, and in the past two weeks he's proposed marriage twice, and told her he loves her at least three times. Twice she's made him cry by telling him she was going to delete him on Facebook. However, she's apparently given him her email address, phone number, and address, and is planning on meeting him in person over winter break or Thanksgiving. I've begged her not to, and in a recent stroke of genius, I said this ""I can't control your actions, but I certainly will not approve of them. If you're gonna hang out with this guy, at least have a trusted male friend with you, okay?"" 

What I'm wondering is, am I being a good friend or am I overstepping any boundaries, and is there anything else I can do to protect her? I would like to let it be known that I have no ulterior motives here, romantic or otherwise, and we are currently separated by many miles.",1
1145,"Throwaway, obviously. Also, probably TMI.

So I suffer from depression (I have started up treatment again recently), so it's been quite a while since I've had sex, due to a lack of will. The last girl I really got close to (last summer) left me soon after I told her I did not want to get physical (due to me using her for emotional support and not wanting to lose that, yes this was not a good idea). This past weekend a friend of mine brought me out when a friend of his girlfriend was visiting from out of state. We all hung out, had a good time, and long story short, I ended up having sex with her at the end of the day. We had been getting along awesomely. We both were aware beforehand that sex was probably going to happen, barring any unforseen consequences. We didn't discuss it, but when we were finally alone, we jumped to it.

Unfortunately it wasn't that good. She was very attractive, and I had been told that she was attracted to me. There was no pullback or shyness when I was making moves. But here's what happened. Please note that I have actually never had a one night stand before, and have always had sex after about two or three weeks of dating (and they had always been friends beforehand).

She wanted me to do all the work and wasn't interested in reciprocating. She also kept wanting to drink more beer, and I had to take the can away from her a few times. I fingered her, and even quickly went down a few times. She was obviously enjoying it, telling me when it was too hard, where to position, moaning, and telling me not to stop. She dug into my back and said my name when I went deep inside her. However, she kept wanting to do it missionary only. We were on a couch, so the few times that we transitioned to the upright position where I'm sitting and she's on top of me (where it's actually comfortable for me), it didn't last long before she got off and had me go back on top. She eventually orgasmed, laid there a minute then shot up saying she hurt and went to the bathroom.

When she came back she looked done and said she wanted to put her pants back on. Obviously, I had not gotten off yet, and said this. She asked what I was expecting her to do. I said anything she was comfortable with. She told me to take the condom of, so I did. She stroked me for about two seconds and then told me to put another condom on. So I did, and sat on the couch, she got on top for about two seconds and then laid back down and told me to get on top. So I did and finished. I went to the bathroom, and when I came back she was fully dressed and lying down on the small couch. I tried to get her to sleep with me on the big couch (we had one blanket and pillow, plus the small couch is cramped) but she said she didn't like sleeping next to people. So I gave her the big couch and pillow/blanket and slept cramped on the small one.

What happened here? Since she lives in another state I won't see her again, but the next day I was feeling really sick and depressed. I don't know if it was me, or her, or this is just what happens during one night stands, or what. I asked my friend if I should send her a message on facebook (we're not friends on there) and he said no, that I'm fine. I don't want to contact her because the whole experience was really quite awkward and I don't feel good about it. I am feeling a little rejected because she didn't seem interested in helping me out at all, even though I focused a lot on her. I deleted the dating website account I had set up, cancelled my next date from there, and am not feeling good about future sexual prospects at all.

So... had a bad one night stand. What happened? Maybe I should have posted this to /r/offmychest, but I wanted some perspective from women who are complete strangers.

Here's to hoping she's not a redditor.",1

On the other hand I feel bad that women, have to be harassed all day by creeps and jerks. And I like to think my approaching is so inept, it actually amuses them. And maybe strokes their self-esteem a little.

1148,"I am working at a two-person nonprofit organization, am in my second month, and can't take any more of the job. 

The organization has a great mission and compared to other offices I've worked at, my boss is a good guy. He's extremely pessimistic though, and doesn't have much respect for my time - he is constantly complaining, mocking emails he receives (after reading them out loud a few times), or storytelling, which makes it difficult to focus on my work. We work in a glorified closet, and he has asked me to refrain from headphones, so there's no escaping the chatter. 

Recently I've noticed that his sour outlook has been affecting my home life. I dread going in to work. It feels like I'm carrying his emotional baggage uphill. 
The work is also mundane. I haven't been able to do almost anything that I was actually hired for - instead I'm ""gal Friday"" for my boss. 

The organization isn't related to my career at large, but I was excited to get some experience that I've since realized I won't come in contact with.

In a stroke of luck, I have a few job opportunities waiting for me. I freelance regularly and could amp up my efforts there, I'm working on a few projects around town, and am halfway through an interview process for a full-time position in my desired field. Not having employment does not concern me at the moment. 

I'm nervous about submitting my resignation because I don't know how my boss will react, but can reasonably assume it would be negative. Also, I've requested a week off for family matters, and that would be the second week of my two weeks' notice. 

That being said, I don't want to burn bridges. What can you suggest?",1
1149,"Sort of a follow on from the desire post but I’d like to hear mainly about this action.

What does it feel like to be inseminated [“naturally”]?  Is it a relatively simple hot wetness, or is there more going on?  I’ve heard from one girl it sends a tingle up her spine.  How strong is the desire to want this during sex?  What are your thoughts before, during, and after?

I’ll set the stage with my general experience and the whole backstory since it’s not too long:

I’m going in and out which feels very good.   I’m acutely aware of the warmth, moisture, and soft tug as I slide.  Being inside feels unbelievable and is a strong emotional experience.  Without trying to be too grandiose, it feels like my essence or soul has relocated down South because the body is numb and each thrust is euphoric and feels like the only important thing in the world.  Giving a sloppy kiss feels very passionate and connected and tends to up the speed setting for a bit.  All thoughts are slowed down and there is a deep feeling of oneness and union that is also unbelievable -- I’m not religious but this feels “spiritual” to me.  I’ve only been with people I truly care about, which may be part of it, as “making love” sounds right to me.

So this goes on for a long while and eventually there’s a rising swell.  My jaw drops a bit and eyes widen.  Intense pleasure overtakes my body.  One way or another I’m going to finish.  I might let out an “oh my god” or something cheesy like “I’m so in love with you.”  I have enough control to pull out if I need to, but oh wow it feels great to go all the way.  The actual ejaculation feels like a throbbing, not overly powerful locally but the body high is at its strongest for the next few moments.  The feeling is full blown ecstasy now - full body pleasure but with just a ting of something else, maybe a hint of emptiness as I let it go but that sounds bad and it really isn’t.  The whole process is something akin to an alcohol buzz and a runner’s high but more powerful.  A sense of accomplishment and satisfaction sets in.  Following this is a deep relaxation and tranquility.  My favorite thing to do is stay inside as we both pant and let our heads stop spinning.  After a couple minutes this sometimes leads to another go, especially if it’s been a few days since I’ve last ejaculated.  This wind down is also very pleasurable and endearing, maybe a soft kiss and gentle stroke as you’re still intertwined.

I want to stress the psychological win afterwards.  I feel very human and in touch with reality.  And even still “I can’t believe we just did that” sets in afterwards :p

1152,"**Doing things together**

The worst thing you can do is not make a bad choice, but make no choice at all. Every man will be faced with those moments when he either can’t be bothered to think of something to do with his beloved, or he really can’t come up with any ideas. “What do you want to do?” are the most terrifying words a man will hear, next to “I missed my period” and “I had lunch with my ex.” Whatever you say, don’t sound wishy-washy. Even if your idea sucks, it’s better to forcefully present a sucky idea than to waver and say you’ll do whatever she wants to do. Now, this doesn’t mean you don’t get any input from her. It means you offer a suggestion, and be flexible if she makes a counter-suggestion.

**Shopping together**

If you get that expectant “Will you buy this for me?” look from your woman, muse thoughtfully about the product, and then announce it would look great on your mistress. Ask your girlfriend/wife if it comes with a motorcycle. Wait a few months, and then buy it for her. The object here is to never get caught being the type of man that asks “How high?” when his woman wants him to jump.

**Making it rain**

If you’re going to spend beaucoup bucks on your girl, (and you’re a well-off man for whom the expenditure is inconsequential), don’t get her “stuff.” Buy her experiences instead. Two plane tickets to a European city will be appreciated more fondly than a thousand pieces of jewelry.

**The crying game**

Every so often a girl just needs a good cry. Maybe she had a bad day at work, her parents are bugging her, or she got a shitty haircut. Let her tumble into your arms to sob it out. And, though this won’t need saying for the more experienced men in the audience, don’t say anything. Over and over, I’ve rediscovered the power of keeping your trap shut when a woman is in the midst of an emotional draining. Hug, stroke, and silently sympathize. That’s all you need to do.

**Compliments and flattery**

Keep it rare, spare and unawares. The best compliments are unexpected, and evenly divided between being romantic and raunchy.

**Advice**

Don’t bother.

**Conversational fluff**

Expect that in any relationship, she will be doing 75% of the talking, and you will be doing 75% of the head nodding. If you don’t like this, you should be dating a man.

1153,"So I've gotten different feedback from different women, but I'd like to ask a broader audience. 

Does it bother you/your vagina if a guy has scruff? 

Does the length of the facial hair make it better/worse?

Do you prefer that I shave you a seat?

From what I've gathered, it's usually different strokes for different folks, due to sensitivity or softness of the hair in question.  I'm a bit torn though, since I'm told that I look better with facial hair, but never want to make a box lunch unenjoyable. What do you ladies think?",1

She stroked my hair, and explained that if we married that she would have to keep her own last name as her first name sounded terrible with my last name, and hyphenating hers with mine didn't really help. Surprised and not a little *WTF'd!?* I responded with a clever, ""okay"".... but the romance really ended that morning for her, and we split not too much after that.  Some years later,  I learned she was married, and had indeed hyphenated her last name with her husbands.",1

For those that are into it, how would you describe it?",1
1156,"So some context there was this girl and we met at a martial arts gym I go to (this will be important later) I just turned 18 she turns 17 in a month. I have opted not to go for college for now and I'm a little scared of never meeting anyone in the real world. I have only had two girlfriends so I suck at women.

Now what happened we met at the gym where I am pretty much my happiest and most charismatic. one day she walked in she was hot but I was talking to another girl from school back then so I didn't take notice. Well time passed and it became pretty evident to everyone except me that she liked me... I was a clueless idiot and another girl had my attention. So everyone keeps telling me she likes me and at first I just laugh it off and don't think much of it but as time progresses I begging to notice her more and more soon I develop a crush on her and then we start face timing and talking on the phone! Turns out shes pretty damn awesome haha but we had a really weird thing going where we both liked someone else and we both liked each other as well. So we both pick the other person and we both get rejected. We both talk again but are more reserved when we talk to each other than we used to be i didn't like this very much but i just kept going and then we both find someone new that we like she gets asked out by another guy and says yes. I decided you know (let's call her R) I regret not choosing R the first time so this time I think you know fuck this chick I'm just gonna go after R now. A few days later she has a boyfriend like I mentioned earlier so I'm hurt for sure but I decide whatever if she's happy that's good enough and I just try to be a friend. Well she is always very honest and candid (one of the traits I appreciate most about her.) and she tells me about their relationship and says she was just kinda ready for a boyfriend and she liked him but she had a crush on another guy as well. So after a bit of prodding she says it's me that she has crush on.

So this is where I get weird. I in my infinite wisdom decide you know what I'm gonna just back off and let R and this guy be together without me interfering. Idk why I decided to do that I still liked her and idk but I did it... Well for about a month then I notice her looking said a few days in a row at the gym and I talk to her and we start talking on the phone again. My intentions where pure just help out my friend and see what was wrong but she started talking about all the things he did that she didn't like and he was upsetting her in general. She talked about how I was better than him (witch stroked my ego nicely) and we started flirting and she seamed much happier now and we went swimming and hung out and shit was great!!!! Until one day we were in the gym playing around and wrestling which turned me on of course haha so I kissed her on the cheek she just laid there and barely blinked. After a few seconds she said something along the lines of ""wow you kissed me even though I'm all sweaty and ugly"" we soon went home.later we talked about it over the phone she said that she wished I had kissed her on the lips (I wish I had the balls to have done it) but she was still dating this other dude and I couldn't kiss her. So I didn't and I stopped texting her and we became friends again and things seemed kinda normal.

Then she broke up with her boyfriend and I was fucking ecstatic! Things were weird for a while she was a little sad over the break up but after a week she was back to being herself again. We flirted every second we were around one another but we would never text or call each other and for a while it went on like this until I had a fight coming up and I blocked her out a bit and just focused but we would still flirt a bit and she would text me a lot and always be positive so ya. Fight day comes and I win! She was in the crowd and after I'm done my family and friends come congratulate me and she is standing off to the side I spot her looking awkward and cute. haha I finish talking to my family and I run over to her pick her up twirl her around and I just feel like fuck ya!!! So it was kinda the best day of my life and we spent the rest of the day lounging around laying on each other and talking and just bliss.

So I finally decide to ask her out three days later she has still been pretty affectionate towards me.I ask her to go see spiderman she says she can't that's cool i'll find sometime shes not busy. But then she acts very cold towards me the next day and I take poorly that she's so suddenly cold towards me (this freaks me out I am not a jealous guy I'm not a clingy guy but if a girl I like doesn't like me I try to get away from her because I didn't want my heart broken).so the next day we are having a 4th of July party she try's to be with me again and I just push her away the entire time and she gets pissed about it. Any way later we talk about it sort of so things are back to normal.

Your close to the end I promise!!! Things are normal but we both don't really flirt we just act like friends except it pretty tense. I take the strategy of well if she wants me she can come get me. I don't call her text her or go out of my way to talk to her then she does talk to me more and she things are warming up again!! She leaves for two weeks to go out of town I leave for one week and I don't text her at all I hoped she'd text me and she did the day before we were going to see each other inane she just said ""I miss your face"" we talked a bit I was happy and now we are up to current. I have no clue what to do now her dad has out of nowhere decided he doesn't like me monday, she ignored me Tuesday and she went bowling with another guy on Wednesday I can't tell if she likes him or not I'm not jealous I'd just like to e with her. So ya we haven't texted at all so I guess my question is should I go after her and maybe text and call her (not to much though) or just continue with if you want me you have to come to me strategy? Thanks and I'm sorry it's do long!!!!

1158,"I'm a *bit* buzzed, and I honestly think this post would be better suited to..... any other sub, but I came here. *Please* bear with me.

I'm 25, my gf is 26, we've lived together for a bit over a year, dating for a short time before that.

As a boyfriend, I think I would describe myself as ""awesome."" I show random gestures of love, be they gifts, or cards, or what have you. I clean the apartment, do the dishes, I make a tremendous effort to build a rapport with all of my gf's friends. I let her know how attractive I find her constantly, but I never smother her, I let her go out with her friends or siblings without me, without a word. I consider myself pretty handsome, witty, charming, funny, etc etc. I feel like I'm almost constantly going that extra mile, often without any sense that it's being appreciated. I listen to all of her ideas, concerns, passions, and I'll share in them.

As a *man*? I would describe myself as ""sub-par,"" on a good day. I'm lazy and unmotivated. I can be judgmental, petty, or just generally a downer. When I'm enrolled in school, it's just a few classes that I'm barely invested in. When I have a job, it's meaningless and directionless. I'm *extremely* generous with money, when I have it, but the second I'm out, I'm a nervous wreck, absolutely no fun to be around. My girlfriend and I have a ton in common, but the core difference between us is that she's working towards her life goal, and I'm kinda just floundering, hoping for some miracle I'm in no way working towards.

Anyway, here we are. Today my gf found out I'm not enrolled for school for the Fall. I honestly couldn't be, I have *no* money right now, and I *need* to find work (something I'm working towards in the slowest, laziest way imaginable). She hasn't talked to me all day. She found out and was furious. She left for school, and immediately went out with her friends afterwards. I *totally* get where she's coming from, but I feel like she's not even considering, for a moment, what *I'm* going through. I could have asked my family for some money, but I have *serious* reservations about doing that (a trait she doesn't share). I've been an absolute wreck for the past few weeks because of my current financial situation, and that's been totally lost on her. She claims she ""could've helped me,"" but that's absurd, she's in the same financial straits as I am right now. I could have payed for tuition, but the idea of her paying for books, gas, food, what have you, is *impossible.* I've been skipping meals I'm so short on money, and she's about in the same boat.

Part of me feels like this is, honestly, the straw that broke the camel's back. I don't know where those other straws came from, though. When she goes out, it's only ever with her friends. We only ""hang out"" in the capacity that we're both in the apartment, doing our own thing. We do *nothing* together. I used to *love* that we could do that, but that's when we used to go out occasionally. I've told her that I want to go out and do things, but it amounts to nothing. She'll go on a vacation with her friend, she'll go drinking with her sister, and then when she's home, she'll watch a TV show and I'll be on my laptop, in total silence. On top of that, we'll have sex one or two times a *month.* If that's okay for her, cool, but why aren't *my* needs being met? I show the random gestures of love, why can't she do so much as give me a handjob occasionally (I wanna stress, I feel like the biggest asshole of all time saying this, but I just want to put everything on the table right now)?

I'm not perfect. I'm *faaaaaar* from perfect. I totally love this woman though, and I make every effort to show it. I'm getting nothing back.

I'll stop myself there, though. That's me putting the blame on her, which is bullshit of me. I've shown so little motivation in bettering my life. To her, I *cringe* to think how I must look. For all of my qualities, I'm a lazy asshole, and finding out that I'm, at this point in my life, putting off school for the jillionth time, *has* to be wearying.

Soooo, yeah. I'm scared, right now, that she's putting up with all of this right now out of some misguided sense of pity, or obligation, or what have you. This is *her* place, and I'm the one with no money, she might think that I'd be homeless if she broke up with me now. My birthday is in, literally, just a couple of days, maybe she doesn't want to ruin that for me. I could find a friend to stay with, and I'd be back on my feet in weeks, when push comes to shove. I've never really had a memorable birthday, stuff like that means nothing to me, I'd be fine.

I just feel, sometimes, like I'd be doing her a favor if I broke up with her. I'm a downer, I'm lazy, I'm a prick. I also feel, though, like that's me being *painfully* aware of my own flaws, without her being aware of her own, or without her acknowledging my good traits. 

I dunno, I'm all over the place, I'm so sorry for wasting anyone's time. I just had to get this off my chest, and it felt prudent to do it for women, and I can't explain why. I honestly won't begrudge any downvotes or anything.",1

It was right here!"" as she tried to walk behind the couch into the wall) About things that hadn't happened in years. I called 911 and had her taken to the hospital. 

At the hospital she was diagnosed with sepsis (fully body infection), memory loss, and hallucinations. They transferred her from the hospital 15 minutes from me to the hospital that she had her surgery in 2 hours away. The ER doctor straight up told me that they didn't want to take the blame if what was happening had something to do with the surgery. 

Since then, its been waiting on her memory to return and for her body to get back to normal. She has been slowly getting better, can hold a normal conversation, can walk around and slowly do things now. She has no memory of what happened. Absolutely nothing. Doesn't remember anything between Thursday night to sometime Monday. This is the second time this has happened this year and I still have no definitive answers from the doctors. The first time this happened I'm not aware there were any hallucinations, but she couldn't remember anything including how to put underwear on. It was as if she had regressed to being a 2 year old. 

I'm getting concerned about her health and well being. I'm not even sure where to start with how to get her the care she needs. I've started looking into senior living facilities but all of them are far more expensive than I can even begin to touch. There is one place in the area that is income based, but there is an obviously long waiting list. I'd move her in with me, but she has 3 cats, I have one of my own, and I'm living with my SO and a roommate and we don't have the room for four more beings in the house. 


I'm not even sure where to start looking. Is there a thing where people can come and check on a person once or twice a day? I'd prefer that if something happens she'd be able to get in contact with someone quickly, or I'd be able to call and see if they can check on her. 

I'm tired of feeling like I'll have not heard from her for a day or so and I walk into her dead on the floor. Its only me as far as her family goes. My uncle exists, but hes currently in the process of trying to get a brain tumor removed and lives about an hour and a half away.

1173,"Hello, I could really use some help. I am a 17 year old girl and recently (the past 6 months maybe), I decided to try to improve my cardiovascular health and also build muscle, as well as eat healthier. I have been running and hitting the weight circuit 3 or 4 times a week consistently. I've been a vegetarian since childhood but am eating better than ever- almost no processed foods, lots of lean protein like greek yogurt and cottage cheese, blah blah blah. I cannot make it clear enough, however, THIS IS NOT TO LOSE WEIGHT, just to get healthier. At 5' 1"" and 105 lbs, I'm at a good weight. So here's my issue. I haven't gotten my period the past 4 months. I've lost 3 lbs accidentally the past 6 months, but I have been eating enough and 105 is still an acceptable BMI. I feel like I should go to the doctor or something, but I'm scared to tell my mother why I need to go. She is slightly overweight and overreacts to a healthy diet and exercise-she thinks I've been excessive and unhealthy, and is always encouraging me to eat more dessert and exercise less. If I tell her about this I'm scared it'll be an ""I told ya so!"" and a demand that I pick back up my previous habits.

What do I do? Should I just not go to the doctor? What's the worst that could happen? Will my body adjust to this new routine and start ovulating again? Please help!!

1174,"I'm older (F) and he's older too. We've had an on again, off again, LDR for two + years now. (Five hour commute for me and it's relevant in context.)

I drove away from his place the morning of Dec. 31st utterly disgusted by his best 'gal pals' behavior and his complete dis-respect towards me because of them, the night before. 

Late March he sends a text msg. My antenna is on High Alert. I wait. Then respond,  reserved. He starts blowing up my phone! At this point I'm fully aware that he's got some stuff happening in his 'little world' that has nothing to do with me and having 'tasted' his pathological lies, narcissistic bent, and massive BS factor; I'm all 'in'!

April he's pretty 'mushy & gushy' and he's straining to maintain!

 He pops over here that last weekend. We have a good time.  I chose a top rated, out of the way Restaurant and the meal was out of this World Delicious and the bill was modest. He complimented me!!!!(SHOCKER there!)

I give him some Medical/Dental Health ultimatums blah, blah, blah.... (also relevant in the length of time given to this relationship...) Thank him for coming over...

Fast forward a few days and I'm cooking with my grown kids and my phone rings. Normally, I never pick up a call on my cell from an unknown number, ever!!!!!!

The man is introducing himself as my 'guys' attorney and he wants to know if I'm willing to speak with him on behalf of 'his client'.... I nibble and he starts telling me this story.

His attorney begins telling me a story of a woman that was injured. His story doesn't at all match what I was told. His story doesn't at all match and so I tell him what I knew, I asked questions, he answered and it became clear that there was a second 'woman injured in the same manner, as the first! 

His own attorney described her injuries to me as ""gruesome, deep  wounds, requiring multiple skin grafts!"" 

The same as the first!!!

Somehow, I managed to get her age, weight, height, a first name and an location of the 'injury event',  from 'his' attorney. 

I considered this 'shit' for a few more seconds with 'my guys' attorney and abruptly ended the call. 

His attorney sends me three walls of text apologizing and can we speak at a latter date....

Give myself 48 hours to process this information and plenty of time for my 'guy' to do or say something.

He denies. He lies. He orchestrates some BS about her and then lambasts me!!! He then goes on to say, what a ""good guy he was being"", how only ""good guys finish last"" and how they met there 'casually'...

I bit harder!

Made myself a couple trips over and learned plenty!

I found this woman. 

She was severely injured; required numerous skin grafts; was laid up for three months recovering; lost her job.

The other 'girl' had insurance, ( or so I was told...)  but her injuries and recovery much the same.

Both of them are scared for life!

TLDNR: The man I met is an 'ultimate COWARD POS!!!!' His pathology of denial, subterfuge, wounded me on the surface; his actions took flesh from two innocent women! 

I found the second woman and hope my efforts will help her recover some of her devastating financial/medical/job loss.


EDIT/UPDATE: Sorry it took so long!

Want to thank each of you for helping me! All of you let me see, that I needed to regroup!

Both of the women got on the back of his motorcycle and sustained 3rd degree burns on their backsides. They were burnt from the inside out. The first girl was a young 20ish college friend of his daughter, (he hid this from me as well). The second was a 39 year old that he met on face book (he lied about that...) both incidents happened within a months time.

There is/was some kind of mechanical failure on his bike. However, I had sat the back of his bike for hundreds of miles, on multiple trips and never got physically burnt or injured.  Each of these gals outweigh me by 50/60 lbs and so, they would 'fit' the bike in a way that their butts would extend off the seat and out over the fender. The screw that holds the seat in place is tapped thru the rear fender. The screw was making contact with the tire and sent an 'static charge' up to their moist butts/a rivet in their jeans and literally burnt them from the inside out. There were no burn marks on their jeans!

The second girl had no idea he was 'dating/seeing' someone and was innocent; I did what I could to help. She was grateful for the information/assistance. When she informed me she could go no further, legally and was moving forward, I wished her the best.

He hid his assets. His boss changed his hire 'status' as ""self-employed/contractor"". He didn't carry insurance for passengers. (The minimum in our state is 25,000 and it's not mandatory. I discovered very few motorcyclists pay for coverage of passengers in our state).

I did some 'sleuth' work to find her and in the process, made it clear to the POS that he messed with the wrong woman! 

Thanks reddit!

6,I mean I was in the hospital alone during my open heart surgery 3 years ago which I was almost in heart failure beforehand and rapidly deteriorating. That was a 6 day stay and it was up in Chicago where most of my family on my dad's side is.,0
7,"Well, my dad died when I was in my early 20s. I was older than you, but still basically a kid. 

The first few of years were rough, especially since it really changed the way my family interacted. A major focal point for all of us was gone. We all kind of scattered. I honestly dealt with it by drinking too much, and distracting myself with music and movies and trivia. It numbed my head and helped me smile and forget, but resulted in 3-4 wasted years. 

I still think about the guy often, but it doesn't hurt now (almost 20 years since he passed).

It still hits me like a ton of bricks in certain situations. My 3-year-old boy asked me where my daddy was the other day, and why he couldn't meet him. Not easy to answer. Other times, I just smile when I catch myself using one of his old expressions. 

Advice? I don't know, man. Try to maintain strong friendships, stay in touch with your family even when they piss you off, allow time to pass, and do the kind of stuff that would make him proud. Use the time that you have. Distance and life experiences are the only things that will really heal you. Sorry for the clichés, but it's all I got. ",0
8,"It was not my direct experience, but I was with my wife for about 6 months when her father died. He actually had a heart attack before she and I got together, but we were friends, and that actually brought us a bit closer, since she didn't really seem to have anyone who was checking on her or her situation.

Their relationship had been rocky since she was a kid, but within the last few months prior, they had come back together, he had really worked on curbing his drinking (he was an alcoholic, and apparently not a very nice one), and they were seeing each other regularly. She was finally able to have that bond she had wanted, and then it was ripped away from her. 

He never fully recovered, and was bed-ridden from that point on. He showed some signs of possibly being able to walk again, and was working on his speech, but it eventually got to a stopping point. I believe he stopped at around the mental capacity near a 4-5 year old, and was not strong enough to feed himself.

Eventually he was sent home from the care facility, and he began to decline a bit more rapidly. He stopped eating, and lost weight quickly.

Once he got that sick, my wife (girlfriend at the time) went and saw him more regularly. 

Eventually he passed, and I was actually out of town working at the time. She was crushed, and at 18 had to help plan her father's funeral. I cannot imagine her feeling.

She actually came to work with me for several days, because she actually couldn't handle being at work, or sitting at home alone after they sent her home. She would just cry at certain points, after something would remind her of him.

Later that week, we went to his funeral (fitting weather, dreary, rainy, and cool), and that was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. She was obviously broken up about it, and once the ceremony started, it was horrible. Seeing her so crushed and upset really got to me. She said her goodbyes, and we went and spent some time with her grandparents, since they lived close by. We hung out for a few hours, but still had a number of hours to drive back.

She asked me if we could stop by the grave site one more time before going home. Little did I know, the hardest part was coming.

We went back out to the grave site, her still upset, but not currently crying. We walked back out to his plot, and the tears just started up again. I asked her if she wanted some time alone, and she said yes. I walked away to give her some space, and just watched from a distance. I've never seen anything just crush me and make me cry like that. Seeing a daughter who had finally been able to re-kindle her relationship with her father, and then that was ripped from her within a year's time, and having to say goodbye in a secluded graveyard in the dreary rain was something I don't think I've ever felt such sorrow over. And it wasn't even my father.

I do often times have questions for her about how she's doing, I try to not ask too much as I don't want to continually bring him up, but I don't know what it's like, I've never been through it. 

She tells me she has her good days and bad days, but that it can hurt just as badly on some of the worst bad days. The bad days seem to lessen in frequency, but I'm sure they will probably never go away entirely. I just try to make sure I'm there for her when she needs me. ",0
9,"My Dad was fobbed off by our GP for 10 months with a terrible cough. He was told he had a chest infection and was put on antibiotics, they didn't work so he returned to be told it was an ""inner lung and chest infection"" with stronger antibiotics he was again sent home. He went back when the course was finished with no releif and was told it was a ""deep rooted inner lung and chest infection"" and sent home with an even stranger mix of antibiotics. My Dad was a private and shy man and very rarely complained or visited a Doctor so when he eventually couldn't make it 7 steps from his car door to our front door without turning a charcoal grey colour in his face I put my foot down got him in the car and drove him to our nearest walk in centre. He was seen to by the nurses in the passenger seat of the car and was immediately blue lighted to the hospital where they discovered he had Advanced Lung Cancer and due to the severe strain on his heart and lungs his pericardum sac surrounding his heart had also filled with fluid and was barely beating. He died in hospital 6 weeks later. 

Our GP practice was 9 houses down at the top of our street and on the day of my Dads funeral the GP came to our house offered his apologies and swore he would never forgive himself and announced he needed to retire because ""his heart can not live with his mistake"".

10,"Not so much a lie, as just terrible care.

I had this thing where once in a blue moon I would pass out. Didn't have any known stressers (if i had eaten lately, or what i had eaten, tempurature of the room, etc all differed.)

My aunt is a NP and as we are close she is often the one we go to, but I have a primary that is a full dr for things that are out of her depth or for running blood tests/signing off on physicals, etc. I will never go back to this lady.

The first time I went to her was after I had almost passed out in class, and she wrote it off as a fluke and that i just had low blood sugar because I didn't eat breakfast. Whatever.

It would keep happening once every couple of months or whatever, with it mostly being me standing and i could feel it coming on, and the next time we saw her she ran a heart test, and then told me it was fine now go away.

Uh, its not normal for my body to shut down randomly, you wanna try that again sis? Nope. ""I could take away your license if you really think this is that big of an issue"". Bitch threatened to take away a life of independence (no public transport here, and would be very hard to get back if its withdrawn by medical person) because I wanted more than a ""some people just faint, sucks to suck"".

I never figured out what it was and we went to a heart specialist and another doc as well, but it hasn't happened for years now. I'm still pissed at that doc for threatening a scared teen because their body liked to randomly shut down.",0
11,"This is random, but I actually had a similar condition growing up. It started when I was like 15 after getting accidentally kicked in the face in the pool. I passed out then and was pulled from the pool. I was told I was convulsing, so everyone thought it was a seizure. Over the next several years I had several unprompted ""seizures"" where I would feel it coming on, pass out and sometimes convulse. My parents took me to several neurologists who confirmed I wasn't epileptic, and they also sent me to a heart specialist who said I was fine there too. I did EEG's, sleep studies, all kind of tests but I never could get a solid answer as to what was causing it from Doctors. It was never by lack of sleep/nutrition.

It continued into college and would happen once or twice a year. Happened once on a subway on a trip to NYC, thankfully was able to quickly tell the friends I was with what was about to happen. I usually could predict it about 5 mins beforehand. I would get a headache, feel lightheaded, hear a ringing and get a sort of tunnel vision. Few times I would feel it coming on while driving. I would pull over immediately, pass out, rest for a bit until I felt good, then continue driving.

Finally a new neurologist examined me. His diagnosis was that these were actually a rare/severe form of migraine that exhibited all the same symptoms as seizures. I'm not sure if I trust that, since he was the only neurologist I saw that claimed it.

14,"Mine was really nice.

The ultrasound I got came back all good and the heart specialist was all ""I get why you came, but between this and the EKG, I'm confident in saying your heart is not the issue. I can send you next door to neurology in case it is a brain thing or nutrition if it's a blood sugar thing or order another set of blood tests done if you can get in right after an episode, but we are just guessing at this point. As long as you can feel it coming on and get yourself safe (not on stairs or driving) then your best bet is to just hope it passes as time goes on. If this is still an issue in a few years or it gets worse then I'd start visiting specialist again. Until then it will be a lot of expensive tests taking a shot in the dark""",0
15,"I should have been more clear; My doctor put me on more than the required mg dosage for my medication (Topiramate) When I went to see a new doctor, she made a passing remark that I was on so much that it could kill me.

I completely understand why passing out while driving would be terrible, for me and others, it just did not apply well to my case IMO, and was agreed on by everyone until I dare show concern over her lack of diagnosis. 

Even having the name of it would have been very helpful in alleviating our fears, or even just some general medical terms that could describe what was happening should we ever need to tell another medical professional.

Do your best to keep fed and hydrated. It's okay to be selfish and throw silent tantrums for a while, you won't success if you try not to anyway. I know I spent most of my time in front of her tomb for a couple weeks, just a place with nobody around to annoy me where I could freely let go and reminiscing of our memories together. You do you.

The excruciating pain is inevitable. But it will slowly fade, and eventually away. Try to let it hurt, and accept that it's natural that you would feel that for your friend. It will come back on occasion, just like it is for me right now, though.

If you're convinced that as you are right now, a funeral is not what can help you, it's okay. Find your own way to try and say goodbye, when you can say goodbye. You two were close enough to have your special things.

The people around you will see you and know you're hurting, so you don't really need to tell about it to keep them informed. But for me, it's the living who were left, who helped me slowly go back to want to function in life. Opening up to the people who would let me. It can start with something as inane as ""it hurts"" or ""I can't stop crying"" or anything true about how you feel. It will flow naturally, the point is just to not keep it bottled up.

See if you want to keep physical mementos of her (or maybe numeric on physical support,) and start planning how to ensure you preserve it and never lose it. In twenty years you'll still want to sometimes look at them.

Time will help you buddy, but I know what's it like. Hang in there. There is nothing to do about the hurt but let it hurt. But it's okay. And you'll go forward sooner than you think.

Original comment by /u/GSnow

Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.

I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.

Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.",0
21,"Firstly I am so sorry for your loss.

Now I am going to tell you a story that I hope helps you accept her decision.

A friend/former coworker lost his wife about seven years ago to cancer. She had battled it off and on for nearly thirty years, breast, skin, some kind of lymphoma and finally colon. We sometimes would go out for a beer and he would talk to me about her, about her fight and about his guilt. About a year or so early when she was diagnosed for tbe fourth time she was tired and suffering and asked him to leave his gun when he went out, he knew what this meant and decided that he couldn't he convinced her that suicide was not the answer. Then while talking to me he started crying. ""If I had known what she'd be going through now I would have let her.""  It was then that he told me what he hadn't told anyone, the cancer had spread up her spinal cord, she had minimal use of one arm and no use of her other three limbs, she was blind in one eye and in so much pain that constant morphine did virtually nothing. ""I didn't let her go because I was selfish."" 

She passed a few days later and he confessed to me that he remembered the good times but that he could never shake the image of the pain ravaged shell of the woman he'd loved since he was 14.

22,"She saw and felt your pain.  Just as you saw and felt hers.  The beautiful thing is that your love for each other conquered the pain and suffering while you both held on to each other.

Many people see suicide as a product of mental illness.  They don't understand the physical pain and suffering that can lead to it.  Even in instances of ""mental illness"", it is the physical,chemical imbalance causing the tremendous pain.

You gave the greatest gift to your friend.  Compassion, you gave caring at the hardest of times.  You comforted her when most turn away because sometimes love hurts.  I learned this helping as my father was dying, wasting away from a terrible disease.

You have done nothing shameful.  Your parents should be proud they raised someone as caring as you.  Your friend was lucky to have someone like you.

23,"First off, I am so sorry for your loss. I can't imagine what you have been feeling.

As a therapist myself, I want you to know that whatever you are feeling is ok. Grief encompasses myriad feelings, from despair to anger; even joy, and so on. Grief is not a linear process, so the best thing to do right now is to be fair to yourself, regardless of what you may be thinking and feeling, even if it doesn't seem quite right. Like other commenters have stated, I would recommend seeking outpatient treatment with a licensed therapist who specializes in grief counseling. I am not a specialist myself in this particular area, but I've seen it work wonderfully for many people I've referred.

If you do decide to begin treatment, allow yourself time to build a trusting relationship with the clinician. S/he will go at your pace and support you along this process.  I hope this helps and finds you in a good place.",0
24,"Wow, this is painful to read. I can't imagine the pain you're feeling right now, but just reading this post is making me cry. 
 When someone that I love passes away, it helps for me to be around others who are mourning that person too. I know you said that you cannot go to her funeral, and it's ok if that's too hard for you, but I would highly reccomend going. You absolutely do not need to look at her body, that's completely normal to not want to do that. I know that you feel so alone right now, and talking to others who loved her too may take some of the weight off your shoulders.

26,"Good advice here. First thing is not to let yourself get on a downward spiral. Get up in the mornings. Get a shower. Shave. Eat. Go for a run/bike ride/swim. Take care of yourself.

I still miss my best friend (passed away 7 years ago suddenly from the flu in his 20s). But it doesn't surprise me anymore. Now I can miss him and smile at the same time. If you know some of her friends or family, maybe reach out to them - they're feeling what you're feeling. If you go to church, talk to your pastor - this is what they gear up for.

Seriously though, I don't believe those of us with a family history has any choice in the matter. My father had a quad in his late 50's. He was/is 5'6"" 120 pounds soaking wet. He is an avid martial artist and eats relatively well (an occasional hefty steak) and drinks a glass of wine a night (better than the cognac when he was younger). After his heart attack he ate even better and still had a second one in his 60's. 

My father's dad, grandfather, and brother have all had heart attacks. My mom's father and brothers all had heart attacks. I have **no hope** of not having one soon (I'm in my late 40's). 

This doesn't count the family type 2 diabetes. Everyone except my father and mother have it on both sides. And no, they aren't all fat. We just don't make the cut for Type 1. 

IMHO: It comes down to how you recover from family illness and not will you have it. My dad is still super active. To the point my brother and I yell it him to slow down and let us do it for him. He refuses to let a heart attack control his life. I hope I'm that strong when it is my turn to face mine. ",0

Heart disease runs in my family too. My dad had a heart attack when he was 52. He was/is very fit. In fact, he'd run a 10k the day before and won his age group, and was a Boston-caliber marathon runner when he did longer runs. Before that, his mom had a heart attack and quadruple bypass. Several of his family members have similar stories as well. 

His cardiologist actually mentioned that my brother and I should start getting screened for heart disease when we turn 40 since there is such a strong family history. It might be worth looking into when you're older. In the meantime just take the best care of yourself that you can. ",0

My step moms been taking it seriously for the last decade since my grandfather passed, making sure my dad eats healthier.

33,"My mother has Parkinson’s and I work professionally with adults with learning disabilities, so I know the type of frustration you must be feeling.
One thing I always find helpful is to read up on whatever condition it might be etc so I have an understanding of what is happening biologically within the individual, this really helps me to rationalise what is happening if someone is being slow, or not responding etc

Another good thing to do is to find tools or techniques to make it easier for the individual to communicate- be it picture cards or just asking yes or no questions so it doesn’t require so much effort to answer on their part. It’s great to hear that your dad is really working on his communication- perhaps you could offer to help him? Does he have exercises from a speech therapist? Perhaps you can go through them with him- that will not only help him, but help you to understand his level of ability or at the very least you will become more used to his new way of communicating.

It is ALWAYS hard when something life changing happens to someone you love- I resented my mum for having Parkinson’s for a long time, because I I think deep down I felt like she was always going to be the strong presence in my life and the model I based myself from, and in my eyes she was crumbling away and it made me scared.

43,"Welllll it took three different doctors and two hospitals six years to actually diagnose me with a cardiac problem.

Yeah. I’d go in with chest pain, back pain, left arm numb.

They ER’s would hook me up to EKG machines, do x-rays, draw blood... and then send me home saying I wasn’t having a heart attack.

The Docs would have me run on treadmills with EKG machines... and then send me home saying I wasn’t having a heart attack.

Stomach docs would prescribe more and more stomach meds that consistently didn’t work.

Finally after six years a *nurse*, watching me run in pain on a treadmill and an EKG machine (with normal EKG), said “You know what? I’m tellin that doc you need a nuclear stress test.”

Thankfully the doc agreed because the nuke found an “abnormality” on the left side of my heart.

The cardiac cath showed that “abnormality” to be a 99% block of the LAD (The Widowmaker).

One big ass metal soda straw later and I’m climbing up stairs and bicycling pain free.

But not symptomatic free.

I still get the same symptoms I had before, just not after exercise.

Turns out the nerves for “you’re having a heart attack” pain *are the exact* same nerves for “you’re having bad indigestion” pain.

Know what causes indigestion besides bad sushi?

Anxiety that’s what.

Anxiety and stress cause acid buildup and GERD and esophagitis.

Which causes more anxiety because everytime I go to the ER they draw blood, take an X-ray, hook me up to an EKG machine...and send me home sayin “You’re not having a heart attack”.

Here’s what I’ve learned about cardiac problems:

If you want to save someone’s life, carry chewable aspirin with you.

Aspirin and CPR has almost an order of magnitude better success rate over CPR alone.

Do Not just start taking aspirin without talking to a doc.
Even 81mg aspirin can mess you up over the long term.

STOP EATING SO MUCH SUGAR

No really. Sugar irritates the arterial walls and allows for cholesterol to collect on the walls.

I know. Its tough finding any food in a box or bottle which doesn’t have “added sugar” but it’s doable.

Alcohol counts as sugar.

Get up and move.

Go for walks.

Bike.


Fuck for a healthy heart.

Ok I’m done now.

Don’t have a heart attack.

50,"Start slow. Don’t overwhelm yourself with the intimidation of everything about weight lifting when you’re a rookie. 

Machines can be good. But in general, especially at your level, focus on barbells and free weights. The main exercises you want to prioritize are:

Bench/chest press. Pectoral fly. Shoulder press. Shrugs. Lat pulls downs. Horizontal rows. Dead lift. Squats. 

For biceps do curls. For triceps, overhead extensions and pull downs will give you a nice burn. 

Prioritize compound exercises. They will give you the greatest benefit early on. Compound exercises engage multiple muscle groups in the body and you’ll reap the biggest benefit. 

It’s true; never skip leg day. Your legs contain large muscles. If you neglect to activate these large muscles, you’re doing yourself a disservice throughout the week and wasting opportunity to kick start results. 

Start slow. It’s better to do a little consistently than to do a lot every now and then.

Continue with your cardio, but prioritize the weightlifting.

Prisoners get absolutely jacked over time and often have minimal access to fancy machines and weights. They rely on body weight and worthwhile exercises. Push ups. Sit ups. Crunches. Pull ups. Dips. Start trying to work these body weight exercises in when you get comfortable.",0

Brother...  I got out of a toxic relationship with a woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.  I loved the 50% of her that was kind, fun, funny, and a real pal.  Unfortunately, 50% of someone is just not good enough.  The other half was controlling, stubborn, nagging, domineering, and completely unreasonable.  We fought constantly, because I never actually let her control me. I'm too independent for that. Nonetheless, I saw something in her that made me want to share a lifetime together.  I only saw the good part.  She left me on several occasions, only to make up with me.  I finally noticed the pattern:  She would always leave me after we had a *wonderful* time out together; really wonderful, romantic evenings at her favourite places.  I finally figured out that she would leave me because she didn't want to get ""stuck"" with me.  I make a comfortable living for a single guy.  But she wanted more.  She has more money than I do, and so she didn't want to get stuck with a man ""below her station"" according to her traditional mother.  Fk did that hurt.  It's hypergamy, and very real.  She's now with someone who makes more than I do. 

The good:  I'm out of it, now.  And better off for it.

The bad:  I'm still in love with her, and there hasn't been a night in 2 years that I've gone to bed not thinking about her.  But while I was with her, I suffered chest pains, heart palpitations, and strange headaches.  All test results negative; stress induced.

Your only choice:  Get as far away as you can, as quickly as you can.   You'll be miserable, and that's normal.  But KNOW that you're executing the ONLY choice.  I'm not much for seeking help, so I can't refer you down any avenues. But just know you're not the only one, and that being out there alone, licking your wounds is FAR better than constantly being wounded over, and over again.  GET OUT OF THERE.  Clean up whatever remaining business you have with her, if any, and ghost.  Bid a good riddance to bad rubbish, even though you still love her.  I get it.  But there's no choice. She's gone.

My observation was that this entire thing is going to pass through multiple ""stages"". Your mother's relationship with your father will be tested, as will yours, and you will probably experience alternating periods of being aligned and badly misaligned with various factions of people involved, as well as periods of peace and turmoil within yourself. 

Stoic philosophy has much to say on this issue. You are in the type of situation where ""thinking ahead"" is impossible, for the future is riddled with moral questions and complex legal processes that will do nothing but create anxiety in yourself should you put your mind there. In stoicism, one looks only to the present moment and present problems, focusing your mind on the tasks that currently fall within your control and not casting your mind further. Practically speaking, this means choosing your next action and your next thought, but little more. Keeping your mind on the immediate, practical and controllable will minimise your anxiety and permit you to be a rock in a time when everything you've come to know as stable is changing.",0

62,"It really is not that cut-and-dry. 

For example, tickling can be completely innocent, but it is also a very common way for abusers to “accidentally” fondle children. It has that perfect ambiguity of, “did they touch me there on accident, or on purpose?” so that the victim often doesn’t even really know what to think. 

One person who abused me as a child did use tickling, and it was confusing, because on the one hand we were playing, right? But on the other hand, at times it felt weird. Why did it feel that way? As a child, that was hard to interpret. As an adult, it took a lot of reflection and looking at that person’s overall behavior towards me and other children to realize that no, they didn’t touch my breast on accident. No, it wasn’t a coincidence that they’d always want to have a “tickle fight” when we were alone. There was a reason this activity that felt perfectly innocent with my mom felt uncomfortable with this person. 

Molestation often isn’t as simple as, “that person touched my privates,” especially in the beginning. It often starts with fuzzy behavior that can easily be passed off as normal. That the above commenter looks back at that moments and wonders, and kind of believes that their dad did what they were accused of, means that it’s likely there was something that felt off about these seemingly “innocent” activities.",0

65,"The problem is that so many people cannot think precisely or with nuance.  The ""resolution"" of their thinking is just too low.  They think in broad strokes, but not in detail.

For example, ""not being believed"" is NOT the same as ""accused of lying.""  As others said, you can presume an accused man innocent while also presuming the accuser is being sincere, and then see where the evidence leads.

But to so many, if you don't 100% believe in and support the accuser, based on nothing beyond their initial accusation, then it's one and the same as DISbelieving them.  But it's not.  There are plenty of things I neither believe nor disbelieve.  I reserve judgment.

But then if you can get someone to wrap their head around that concept they'll probably just accuse you of cowardice or something.

I support most of the #metoo stuff, and on the whole it's been very good to bring such things to light.  But ANY group of humans will inevitably have a significant portion of morons and muddy thinkers in it.

And it's important to realize that when you've identified the morons in a group, it doesn't mean their opposition doesn't also have just as many morons in THEIR group.

I was involved in a situation once, where two women came to me bringing an accusation against a man I knew, based on the hearsay testimony of a 3rd woman who wasn't there.  From what I knew of the guy, I wouldn't really have been surprised if it WAS true.  If it was, I'd be perfectly happy to nail his hide to the wall.  But the problem was his accuser wasn't there.  It was all hearsay.  I said to get her in and let's get some direct evidence.  That never happened.  The two that came forward seemed disappointed nothing was done.  But we literally had nothing to go on.  Don't get mad at me for a bad guy escaping justice if *the only people that have evidence of his wrongdoing* remain silent.

come up with a list of things you’d like to know, maybe a keepsake list? take lots of photos with him.. trust me you will want this stuff after they’ve passed and you’ll want to know the story behind them.. i’m not sure if you have siblings but i would seriously sit him down and talk about his health and if he needs help that you’ll always try your best to help him (if that’s what you are willing to do). maybe talk about some of your concerns.",0
71,"I don't wanna seem mean, but I'll speak from my own experience from a guy who hasn't met my own dad, but was raised by my grandparents till I was around 10 and my mom got custody of me.

First off, 70 isn't young by any means. If he's just now getting to this age and genes are finally catching up to him. Then he's done a hell of a job. Not to say to expect your dad to die at any moment, but he's old by medical standards, and as I work in healthcare, diabetes is manageable, and if he's conscious about it, he can live another 10 years.

Quick TL;DR: Try to spend quality time with him where you can. It doesn't have to be super 1:1, or grand standing ""you've been a great dad"" moments, though that would probably make him happy. Just take the moments and conversations about topics or things you may have not known and appreciate him how you can. It might end sooner than you expect, or you could get more time than you thought you needed. Just don't fear the day when it does happen, cause you gotta be strong and appreciate his memory.

Now, to my story. I was 24/25 and my grandfather (tbh he wasn't even my actual grandad, but he married my grandma), and as I was about to move back home after being away for a couple years in my first out of college job. I hadn't talked to him much while away, and after I got into high school, the amount of time I spent with him dropped considerably. Although I wasn't his blood, or even old enough to be one of his actual sons, he treated and loved me better than his own, and as I got older, I didn't appreciate it as much as I should've. He died a little before my 25th birthday from a UTI, and was already hospitalized by the time I got home. It's been almost two years now, and all I really wish for was being able to talk to him more and let him know I appreciated his love for me before he passed. It doesn't have to be grand-stand shows of love or big conversations, but the little stuff is what matters. I wish he could've met my kids and they would've known the man who was my dad, but all I can do is cherish what we did have and try to be better from his faults. Good luck man, you'll be okay. Don't be afraid to reach out and chat with him as much as you need, but don't fear the future, you gotta keep going.",0

Last thing: I lost my father at his age of 53.  He died suddenly, and without health warning.  Just dropped.  He and I and a few others were playing a game of pick up basketball, which he loved.  He had become much more fit as he had gotten older, as my sister and I were needing less from his income, each of us married and moved on with our lives, individually.  He was no longer chained down to his job, so he felt new and envigored to play sports, and do things he missed for 20 years.  Lost tons of weight.  But, a heart issue, undiagnosed, took him too soon.  I still love him, and it's now been 17 years since his passing, when I was 27 at the time, and now, in my mid 40's.  I think of my age approaching his when he passed, and I'm conscious of changes that are perhaps even subtle, to my own health.

Spend time with him, if you can.  No one is guaranteed tomorrow, not even you or I.  He loves you.  He saw you from the moment you came into this world, when you knew nothing of what living was.  When his time comes to depart this world, you will be sad, of course.  But you will be left with good memories, hopefully, as I am.",0

And a lesson was that GOOD MEMORIES together are important to cultivate because they'll be what you use to cope when the person is gone.

My father loved to cook. I never really had an interest in learning as a teenager because I was spoiled on the food he made. Now I stand in the kitchen and think ""I wish I would have asked Dad how he cooked this or that."" 

My mother loved make-up and worked for Avon for years. She was a very beautiful woman (I wish I could tell her that) and always wanted to do my makeup and nails but I was a tomboy as a teen and had no interest.

90,"Hello, 

I was in the same situation a bit more than one year ago. My father had a lymphoma (cancer also). He died after fighting for 2 years. We thought he was cured because the scan did not show anything and finally the cancer came back. 

I send you all my support. I know it is not easy at all..

First of all, don't only ask things to your father but don't forget to tell him everything you need to tell him. My father was my model and I did not say that to him explicitly. I still regret it.

- if your father had a strong passion, you should ask him what unforgettable moments he had. My father was a soccer player and he taught me a lot of moments before dying. I will be able to explain this to my children. Same about your father's job.

- ask your father to give you advices about life. His point of view. Because at the end, this is all about this, not about making more money or have more materials. The goal of life.

- ensure that he knows that you and your family are in safe hands. Reassure him.

- buy anything that can make him happy. For my father at the end, it was some sweets.

Take time off to be close to your father and family during these difficult times..

I was living in Ireland when my father got informed that he has a cancer (a second one, first one was cured. My father was not drinking, not smoking, a sportsman... Here we are). Hopefully my company was giving sick leave for a family member and I was able to visit them several times. I finally decided to leave Ireland to come back to my own country, France which allowed me to be there during his last months and moments. Right now, I can tell that I would exchange anything if I had to do it again. I know that I made the good choice. .

I wish you good luck to you, your family and your father,",0

Creating it/adding to it can even be a regular thing you two do together. You can even write down any memories he had that go along with the songs he picks. Music is so incredibly powerful, it reaches deep, it can help comfort him while he's here, and can comfort you and your family once he's gone. I inherited my father's cd and record collection when he passed away, listening to certain songs can still make me feel like he's sitting next to me, it'll be 23 years on the 21st of this month since cancer took him from us.

And for the first time in my whole life he told me he loved me and all of us and that he was sorry about everything. I’ve never heard him say those 2 words to anyone in my family. I lived and took care of him for about 5 months before he ultimately passed. I had wish I heard those words growing up but I knew he was happy on that final day because we all told him that we loved him and we wished we all shared these emotions earlier.

For me, the best parts of his last 12-ish months was just talking with my dad about nothing in particular, making jokes and waking the dog around our neighborhood, but this was also very representative of my brother's and my relationships with our dad.

Another thing I highly recommend is buying a grandparent book. There are a ton of questions designed for grandparents to answer for their grandchildren - my dad recorded a lot in audio and video form, as well as written down, and they're good prompts.

My dad passed away six months before I graduated high school. I then went to basic training (which my dad was so proud of me for before his death).

I plan in getting married soon, and he won’t get to walk me down the aisle. I’ll never get to show him my first child. He won’t see me graduate college. It’s the big moments in life that hurt the worst for them to miss.

2. I know he would have wanted to me to be sad and then move on and enjoy life, but it would have been helpful to hear it from him so I could take that with me when I feel guilty for feeling better. It’s hard to explain but it will make complete sense later. 

3. I’d like to know how he dealt with life’s sadness. He was my first real loss and it’s been devastating.  More loss is coming in the future and how do I live with this?  Coping strategies?

My dad had dementia that was a lot worse than I realized before he got sick, and it progressed exponentially faster after a heart attack. I couldn’t really do much to make quality time, or squeeze life advice out of him.  

What I could do was be there literally every waking moment I wasn’t at work to care for him his last few months. I never let him see me get frustrated. I never cried. I was perpetually understanding. I held his hand and told him I love him. I sat at his side when he couldn’t take it anymore and he entered the active dying phase until he breathed his last breath. It took 24 hours. I carried the weight of all his suffering, and all the fear and anxiety we went through as a family, on my own shoulders. Because I knew it was temporary and I knew he deserved the best I could give him. He left this world with his son at his side through everything, repaying all the love he gave me through a life time. Proving to him in his final moments that he raised a man he could be proud of. 

My dad was older. I always knew this would happen one day, and I knew that I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I wasn’t there for him when he needed me. It’s hard. It’s harder than you think it will be. But I can look back now and know I did everything right. I was everything he deserved. And now, I can move forward with no regrets and be proud of the man I was when he needed me most.

Then he pointed to the garage, which was overflowing with tools.  ""You see all those tools in there?  I earned those. If anyone comes here saying they left something of there's in here, they're lying. You have everything you need in here.""

As I said, he was a soft spoken man. I had never seen this side of him. He teared up and mentioned how he doesn't know how much time he has left. It was as if he was giving me a crash course, trying to pass down as much of his knowledge as he good because he knew his days were numbered. 

I read your initial question and think your father probably has a ton he wants to tell you. Ask him anything and everything.",0
118,My dad is passed and I just wish I remember more of his stories from the old times. Maybe write or record some stories of his childhood or some trouble he got into. My dad had a library of stories and I can only remember half of them and I’m sure there’s plenty he never told me. Was a surprise for him to go so I always thought I had more time.,0
119,"My father passed away a week ago since he was very sick for a long time.   
The thing that I hated the most about the entire thing is that in his last days he wasn't able to talk at all since he had some issues with his throat.   
So this comment is only a recommendation that you should start doing this and asking questions as soon as possible.   


Since you never know when things are going to end.",0
120,"This post hits close to home. Tomorrow will be the first anniversary of my (54F) ex-husband's (68M) unexpected death from a heart attack last year. We'd been divorced for more than ten years when he passed but we remained friends and co-parents to our now 25 year old son, and I was also fortunate enough to remain close to my stepdaughter, her family, and also the wonderful woman who had been my ex's partner for several years before he passed. All of us will be remembering him and grieving tomorrow which will be extra hard since because of COVID-19 we won't be together physically. 

Thank you so much for this post, it's a wonderful reminder to make the most of our time with our parents or anyone we care about while we still have the chance.",0
121,"I'm not a man but anything you do ask him, record it! After time their voice fades away and you forget what they sound like. After my dad passed I found a recording of him saying ""this is for you to remember your grocery list"". The recorder was running out of batteries so I recorded it on my phone. I still listen to it often when I start to forget. Even though the message isn't important, I can still hear his voice. I wish I was able to ask him things that are sentimental and thought about asking question but I was too late.",0

126,My father is dying from stage 4 lung cancer. I had been asking him for my whole adult life to quit smoking. He was told to quit after his first heart attack then told agian after his second. Then agian after his stroke... he refused and now he is going to die before the year is over. He wasnt a very good father to begin with. He provided for me and my siblings but he wasnt a dad to us. He was angry all the time and abusive. As a father myself i will never understand why he was the way he was to us. Im going to be very sad when he passes but my life wont change much. Most of my sadness goes out to one of my sisters who was his favorite and is a huge daddies girl.. she is going to be broken and that breaks my heart. I know this has nothing to do with your post. But i had to share. We are not allowed to see him because of covid 19. If i get to see him before he dies. He will probably just argue with me about whatever i say.... i dont think i would even try honestly...,0

Who was his family member who he was closest to as a child, as a young man, and now?

What's his favorite childhood memory

(If your parents are married) What's your favorite memory about Mom?

Favorite memory with me?

What's the car that he owned that he liked the least, and why?

What are the security questions answers to his important websites and email accounts? Usernames and passwords (I did my dad's stuff over 18 months and there were still websites and emails I didn't have answers to that we needed)

Favorite pet? Closest pet?

Worst breakup and how did you deal with it?

If you live locally, make sure you see your dad regularly. I saw my dad 4 or 5 times a week until he passed away, and I'm so incredibly thankful that I did. Even during the times where everything was going well and cancer treatment was working and we had a lot to think that he may be done soon, still kept visiting and seeing dad.

- A wrong he wishes he could right
- First love
- Last love

- What did he dream of doing or becoming when he was a kid, then a young man?
- What does he want to know, do, accomplish before time runs out? Can you be his wing man?
- What can you do to help him get to the point of peace with himself?
- Who are his cousins, etc. -- his family of origin. Can you both reach out to forgotten family now?
- Is there any chance you may have half-siblings around? Only half-joking.
- What are his wishes for end of life?
- Does he have a will? Help him get a lawyer if not.
- Are his finances in order, or orderable? What are all his accounts so ni savings are lost. Help him find and consolidate everything, transfer money to your mom as necessary so she can pay bills as he gets sicker or passes away.
- Tell him that you live him and appreciate him.
- Tell him that his grandkids will know about what a good man and father he was 
- Tell him that everything and everyone will be OK",0

138,"Yep, was about to put that down.  As an on and off again genealogy enthusiast asking my parents basic questions about their families (i.e. what are your great grandparents' names) helped a lot in getting me started.

Plus I'm sure they've got fun stories from their own younger years and maybe a few tales passed down from past generations.

Edit:  And you'll never know when these people are going to go, so the sooner the better.

Not to steal it, but it would be quite annoying to be at the wrong side of a ""bought old house, found 200.000$ in gold when removing the floor"" news story.

From personal experience, should there be pins and passwords, make sure to know those too.

He locked it in his safe (presumably) and was so paranoid he never told anyone the code. And that’s how I (as the youngest) got left with nothing while my siblings took everything he owned. I don’t even have pictures of him. I didn’t even have the money to hire an attorney to prove I was still a minor for his estate (in high school but 18). Nobody took ownership of his estate, and my brother and sister took everything he owned. There was a lot of sentimental stuff I wanted and nobody even told me they were moving his possessions.",0
142,"This is probably one of my biggest regrets. My mom and dad split when I was young, and I held it against him till I was probably 17. He wasn’t a good person, but he was a good father.

Please don't take it too hard if they don't ask all of it or if they ask different things or may not ask at all. Everyone grieves differently and it's incredibly hard as someone's child to come to terms with their parent expecting to pass away sooner. They may feel guilt, shame, or any other negative emotions and blame themselves and shut themselves away. But get everything out there that you want to say or want to hear from them.",0

Talk about their future, I know it's painful, but they'll take comfort knowing that at each big stage of their life, you are still a part of their lives. 

It's not the same but my nan, who I was very close to, passed away when I was 16. I only have four photos of her, I really wish I'd taken more.

My brother's wife (who herself has since passed) took it upon herself, and NONE of us had ANY problems with what she did or how she did it. There were no squabbles over who gets what or why does someone else get more than I do. I suppose the fact that our mom was/is still alive had a lot to do with that, but I (his oldest son and second child) received his revolver, and I am happy for it.
I have no idea who will take up the mantle when (God forbid), my 80+ year old mom passes. The rest of us all have spouses, so we know who is going to have to deal with our own finances when we go or who will deal with our spouses' when they pass.",0
150,"My dad was sick most of my life. He was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes late in his life and was raising me alone. I knew that he was going to pass sooner than my friends parents but I didn’t know how soon. I got a call from his girlfriend (at this point I wasn’t living with him anymore.. I think taking care of a teenage girl was too rough on him).. anyway I got a call from his girlfriend saying that he was in the hospital, which wasn’t uncommon so I kinda shrugged it off. Then she said this time I think you should really visit him. He was in ICU in a medically induced coma. He died 4 days later. So in a sense it wasn’t completely sudden but it was hard not being able to have a conversation with him in his last days.. I had been staying with a family friend for the past few years so I wasn’t really able to see his actual decline. I’d only see him every now and then because he was always making excuses as to why he couldn’t see me. Looking back, I don’t think he wanted me to actually know how sick he was. So maybe it wasn’t all that sudden but it definitely felt sudden to me because I was in the dark. His birthday is coming up and of course there isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about him.

Edit: spelling",0
151,"That's something that ought to happen, especially if you're the eldest (and he's no longer married). My father and I had a very candid talk (he's also 70, health problems) about how he wants his end of life handled. It's a very sobering and difficult conversation to have, but a necessary one. I'm a paramedic by trade so intimately aware of how messy and horrible this can go.

I'm my father's MPOA, and was made that just prior to him having heart surgery.

He was also in the ICU for 3 days before he called me (which sparked all of this). I forced that conversation on him.

He probably doesn't want to worry you, or feels like it might get you out of sorts.

Important thing is to understand that unless you also are trying to build muscle, don't eat the same food he does in the same proportions. Eat a smaller amount of what he cooks for himself and more vegetables. And make sure he gets yearly physicals with lipid panel/cholesterol labs. That's how you'll know if he's at risk for bad things.",0

159,"if I were in your spot right now, I'd:

1.) Call the grandparents and tell them you want your kids back. Tell them they can spend a little more time with them as you have an errand to run. They won't need to be in a rush to get them ready.
Check on your local call recording laws, if you have one-party consent then record the call. Depending on how that call goes, this could be critical in determining visitation rights in the future and firmly put you in the driver's seat.

2.) Go to the police station and file a report about the documents and jewelry. Make sure charges are filed. If things smooth out as time goes by you can always drop them, but its important that its on record. Then let the police know about the situation with your kids. If you were legally allowed to record the call this would be the time to share that recording - if not, telling the officer about the call while its fresh in your mind is the next best thing.

3.) Go get your kids. I lost a parent at a relatively young age. They need YOU.

At some point you're going to end up in court with these people, and you've said yourself that they're wealthy. Thankfully the depth of their of stupidity is equal to the hole where compassion is in most people. They've given you plenty of ammunition against them but keep in mind they also just lost a daughter. Establish boundaries and make sure they understand that where YOUR kids are concerned - you are the gatekeeper. 

I sincerely hope you're able to get this mess resolved quickly and amicably (all things considered). I'm sorry for your loss.",0
160,"They acted too fast. From the moment of the news, they plotted to steal property and take family members. They tried to seize your legal powers and rights. That's some inhumane, evil shit.

That's toxic. After all that, they say you can be the father again some day? WTF?!
No. In their eyes, you will never be the father. They will never trust you.

They took in the kids and left you cold.

You don't steal family members or legal documents and jewelry from someone that you love, trust, respect.

There is zero possibility of 'working it out' with people like this. Unless you get your kids immediately, they will grow up hearing fake shit that makes them hate you, and blame your wife's death solely on yourself.

Do not let your kids grow up with people that don't have a moral compass. These inlaws will corrupt them beyond all imagination.",0
161,"How long ago did this happen? The eldest child is 13 at the start of the story and 14 at the end. Unless he/she had a birthday shortly after your wife passed away, that means some time has passed and it could change your situation significantly. ",0
162,"Allright OP, just some basics based on your fact pattern:
- You have custody of the children.  Talk to the grandparents and make this as easy on the kids as possible.  YOU HAVE CUSTODY.  If the grandparents give you any crap get the police and go get them.  Right now you have full custody. 
- Right now the house is your property.  Keep the grandparents out of the house and report the property theft to the police and the DA.
- You haven't said if your wife has a will.  If not then her assets will be divied up according to your state""s law.  You will have some sort of statutory interest entitling you to a specific share of her estate.  
- All property, absent life insurance policies, is now locked down in probate.  You need to hire a probate attorney if you and your wife had any sort of substantive assets.  All of your wife's property is now controlled by the probate court and it will be dispersed in accordance with your state's statutes and your wife's will. 
- If there was a life insurance policy on your wife, then that will pass outside of probate directly to the beneficiary.  
- Any property your grandparent's took out of the house without your consent, including your wife's phone, and particularly the legal documents needs to be returned to you as it was in your house at the time of her death. 
 The probate court takes a very dim view of the kinds of vulture relatives who show up to sack a decedent's property before the will is adjudicated.  I have seen a widow call up the court because her relatives were going through her house choosing what they wanted from the estate.  She was crying on the phone because she was elderly and could not physically remove them.  The court sent out a couple of deputies to throw them out and tell them that they were trespassed from the property.  
Right now you need to take a deep breath and get yourself centered, then you need to contact the probate court and find out what is going on with your wife's estate,then, most difficult of all, you need to inform your in-laws in no uncertain term that you are coming to get the children.  Do not put this off past this weekend.  If your in-laws get custody then things become a lot harder.  In a lot of these cases possession is 9tenths of the law.  That is, the court will find it easier to leave the kids in place rather than enforce a new order for custody.  RIGHT THIS MINUTE YOU HAVE CUSTODY.  You need to get your children away from the in-laws as soon as possible.  
Other than this there is not a whole hell of a lot you can do, probate can take up to a year in some places.  I hope your wife had a will and it would be nice if she had had a life insurance policy.  Good luck and sorry about your wife.  
PS.  The fact that you will have custody of the kids will give you a lot of leverage with the grandparents.  They sound pretty heavy handed and you can tell them if they don't back off a little then you won't let them see the kids.  Don't be a heavy handed jerk, and use your kids for blackmail, but you can sure sever ties with this family if they insist on treating you like a piece of shit.  ",0

My father passed away in February, sudden heart attack at 58. Not a day has passed when I haven't missed him or wanted to break down about it. 

Now as far as the kids, legally your in laws cant take them from you against your will, though IANAL. If it was me, I would try to focus on the things I can solve, i.e. getting the kids squared away and everything dealt with as far as your wife's estate, before trying to deal with the things that aren't as straightforward, like your own feelings about it. 

That's what I did with the death of my father. I did my best to make sure everyone else coped with it as well as possible, I don't like showing emotion so I prefer to comfort others. IMO it's cathartic.

In the United States, a Legal Aid lawyer is the same as any other lawyer.  You have passed the bar and are licensed to practice law.  There is no difference.  I know, I am a lawyer.

Custody goes to the survivng spouse.  Assets go to the surviving spouse, though a will or trust can change that.

OP needs to go to a lawyer, ASAP.  I can't give a legal opinion here for a variety of reasons (including a total lack of confidentiality, not knowing what state this is in, and having seen no relevant documents) but can say with total confidence that a local lawyer will know what to do.

Yes, I tailored my answer to Canada, as OP had mentioned living in Canada.

>In the United States, a Legal Aid lawyer is the same as any other lawyer. You have passed the bar and are licensed to practice law. There is no difference. I know, I am a lawyer.

In Canada, a Legal Aid lawyer - or to be more precise, a lawyer paid by Legal Aid - and any other lawyer are both lawyers. They have both passed the bar and are licensed to practice law. In fact, in my province, some people practise simultaneously as 'regular' lawyers and 'Legal Aid lawyers' - or to more precisely, some lawyers in private practice take both paying clients and Legal Aid clients. The difference, because there is one in Canada and it is a huge one, is that a privately paid lawyer would be entirely funded by the client (or their insurance or another third party in some cases) while a Legal Aid lawyer is, at least in part, paid by the Legal Aid. 

Legal Aid will accept to pay your lawyer in your case based on a number of criterial in my province, the income, family situation and assets of the client but also the nature of the case. For instance, it will be granted (if you satisfy the other criteria) in all cases of youth protection but it will never be granted (even if you satisfy the other criteria) if you want to fight a parking ticket. That's why I thought it was important to explain to OP that even if his Legal Aid lawyer told him he couldn't represent him regarding succession issues, he might be able to represent him with custody issues. Lawyers that either work for Legal Aid services or practice privately and accept Legal Aid cases will know the specific rules for their provinces (or know where to look), which is why OP needs to call again.

>Custody goes to the survivng spouse

Agreed, although at least in my province, this is not a question of being a surviving spouse. This is based on filiation.

> Assets go to the surviving spouse, though a will or trust can change that.

Not in my province; he would get about a third of her assets here. Abintestat assets would be shared between the surviving spouse and the children of the deceased (but OP would manage the money for them and be allowed to spend part of it on raising them). Note that this would only be concerning the deceased spouse assets, after the marital assets are split. But that's a bit useless to OP since we don't know what province he is in.

> OP needs to go to a lawyer, ASAP. I can't give a legal opinion here for a variety of reasons (including a total lack of confidentiality, not knowing what state this is in, and having seen no relevant documents) but can say with total confidence that a local lawyer will know what to do. This is not a DIY situation.

Yup, exactly what I said. That's why I made sure to mention it in each paragraph so that even if OP skimmed through, he would hopefully still get the message.",0
175,"Heart attacks in younger folks aren't at all unheard of, especially if there's diabetes, obesity, a family history of heart disease, or whatever. Diseases like atherosclerosis, while rare in younger folks, sometimes have a genetic component and are often silent for decades.

His wife is pissed at him because he plays too many video games instead of cleaning the house and being a parent. OP begins to spend more time away from home and finally stops coming home at all. OP returns to remove his belongings. Shortly after this OP's wife dies of a sudden heart attack (likely an overdose). OP is not present for this.  He doesn't know what happened and when his youngest child finds his mother dead in her bedroom, no one calls OP. Why? Because OP is in jail? Because OP has told them not to call him? Because OP didn't leave them a way to contact him?  Why didn't OP just go there immediately and collect his children?  His house was supposedly paid off, but how if he doesn't even have a job?  His wife paid it off? Maybe, more likely it was a gift from the ""evil"" in-laws. So OP isn't around when his wife passes away. His kids find her, they call the ambulance and try to call him but can't reach him.  So they call the grandparents. Grandparents then find children alone in home with dead mother (their own daughter, dead at the age of 36, having been deserted by her video game playing, mooching, non-parent of a husband). So they take their grand kids to live with them. OP doesn't try to get his kids or live with them?  WHAT??????  WTF is that? Now his kids have aged since then.  Was he there for his daughter's birthday? Why not? Anyway, so OP is fucking done.  That's it. He gave up whatever right he had to make any claim on anything.  He's toast. I hope he can get his shit together.   ",0

180,"TL;DR: Keep moving and you can do it. If you find yourself drifting from your weight loss goals or gaining weight back after reaching your goal, a Fitbit can help you get back on track by showing you your daily patterns. 

Long post ahead. Not looking for sympathy or anything, I got myself into this, I'll get myself out. Just thought I'd share. 

I was never a powerlifter, only occasionally went to the gym, but I was generally pretty fit when I was younger. Walked 10+ miles every day (sometimes wearing weights) kind of fit. This continued at college and I even started studying Capoeira with some friends. I weighed in at 195lbs with a 36inch waist.


Then things went of downhill. Stopped studying Capoeira. Broke up with the woman I was dating (and used to take multi-mile walks/hikes with every day). I bought my first car after my freshman year, so I wasn't walking just to get around anymore. Went from walking anywhere from 6-12 miles to barely walking 2. Kept eating like I always had though. Within a year I had gained around 100lbs. At my heaviest, I weighed 311lbs and had a 50 inch waist. 

I also had issues with my heartrate, and had to give up trying to donate blood as a result. I blamed it on smoking, drinking caffeine, stress from various sources, you name it. I was struggling just to walk up a hill to the parking lot behind the school, and being completely winded by the time I got to my car. One day I was trying to figure out where else I could park to, and I realized how messed up that was. I think that was part of what got me to actually stick to a plan to change things. 

Now, I weigh 267lbs and I have to stick out a leg just to hold them up long enough to put on a belt. There have been some ups and downs on the way. Got a fitbit, stuck to eating ~1,000 calories less than I burned everyday and I started losing 2lbs every week like clockwork. Then I changed jobs, and started working longer shifts sitting at a desk four days a week. Got a promotion to a job that allowed me to work from home, so even less day-to-day movement. I gained back about 40 of the ~70lbs I had managed to lose. I also managed to sprain my right ankle (that makes 3x in my life I've done that) badly enough to end up in a boot and needing crutches to get around. Now I'm active again and I've managed to lose another 14lbs. It's not as consistent a weight loss as it was before, but I'm learning to curb my appetite on days when I'm not as active (the Fitbit really helps here). 

Keeping the weight off is something seemingly everyone who goes through this struggles with. My best advice is to keep moving every day, and remember to rest your body when you need to. Moderation, while not necessarily appealing, is important. Hope I've helped. ",0
181,"I used to be all fit, even out from gym I used to run, swim and eat very healthy food.

But I always wanted to be big, reach 80kg and never passed the 60kg so I came to quit all and started eating a lot, forcing me to eat much more than my normal so, nowdays in exact one year later I'm at 80kg and am thinking on coming back to gym with my nem size and keep it.

I know it sounds like bullshit but I felt like doing this and I'm much happier now.

182,"Was working out 13 hours a week (dojo and gym) at my best.  Was a solid 180lbs.  This past May I was 235lbs and a fat fuck.  Since May I've dropped to under 210lbs and all I did was eat better.  I also have apnea, but I'm fighting the machine.  Losing weight and taking care of myself needs to be the way I deal with it or it'll become a crutch forever.

I highly recommend eggs.  I eat 4 eggs every morning.  Butter for the pan.  Garlic, salt(lightly) and pepper.  Plus two pieces of toast with country crock on them and a little ketchup for the eggs.  Holds me over a good 6-7 hours easy with all the protein.  I eat a small 100 calorie lunch and eat whatever I want for dinner (within reason).  I've been losing weight dramatically and the body changes are amazing.  Cholesterol from eggs is a myth.  It comes from sugar.  And that shit is easy to avoid.  I still drink diet Coke and I feel amazing.  In a few months you're gonna bounce back and feel great and kick ass.  

My advice is to focus on who you want to be.  Make yourself into something better.  You've probably got it easier than you think.  I'm doing it with 2 kids, a shit job, and an alimony payment.  Hang in there and keep your eyes forward.  ",0
183,"I was never cut, but for a few years, I was lifting 3x a week, and running 2x a week.  I was about 50 lbs lighter than I am now.  (I'm 5'5"", so it's really noticable).

I lost my work out partner (and motivator), and started focusing only on running.  That was fine - I didn't really put on much weight (maybe 20 lbs, as I wasn't eating as clean as I used to when I was lifting).  But I was running half marathons, and felt great.

The last half that I ran, about 3 years ago, I came down wrong on my foot at mile, and proceeded to ""power through it"" and run the next 10 miles with a bum ankle.

That did me in, and I ended up with plantar fasciitis, that took over a year to recover from.

In that time, I continued to eat bad, and completely gave up the gym.  Put on another 30 lbs.

So now I'm 50+ lbs over where I was 5 years ago.  I'm in my mid 40s.  I feel like I look terrible.  I've tried getting back into running, and maybe run once a week or every other week right now.  Every day I say ""today is the day I'm going to eat well"" and yet I don't.  Every week I say ""this is the week I'm going to start running again"" and I always find an excuse not to run on any given day.

I've got to do something soon, because I am starting to fear a heart attack myself, and I just can't continue down this path.  I've got to start eating clean (permanently), and start exercising again.  I want to get back into lifting again, and I do want to run, I'm just not going to try for halfs anymore.

185,"When I graduated college I was 160lbs.  I walked or biked everywhere, worked in a kitchen and had some free weights at my apartment that I used every other day. I wasn't buff, but people who i hadn't seen in years would comment on how fit i looked. 

After graduating, I kept working in kitchens and didn't own a car so I was walking/biking for another few years.  It was a good lifestyle for my health, because my job (dishwasher/prep cook) had me lifting and moving heavy objects all the time.  I saw a picture of myself from those days recently and was amazing at how buff i looked. 

As my life got better, i got less healthy.  I got a good job - at a desk.  I bought a car.  I started drinking more beer and eating out more.  I got soft, and it peaked (or plummeted..) in 2012 when I hit 219lbs.  I looked in the mirror and was so upset about what I had turned into.  That's when i started trying to get active again, and went on a diet.  

It's been really inconsistent since then, but today I'm almost down to 190 and am starting to like what I see in the mirror again.   It would take a lot more focus and consistency to get close to where i was at the end of college, but i feel good just eating healthy and getting in exercise when I am able to. ",0

On the other, you're increasing your calories burned to create a caloric deficit. They both have the same result.

There is no true answer. Kissing is simple. You put your mouths together and let magic happen. It's all about sync. 

The nervousness is the worst thing though. Unless you feel relaxed and comfortable, you will stumble, go out of breath, have weird unnatural movements and not enjoy it at all. 

It took me and the girl two nights/tries at which point she said she would teach me how to do it because I'm worth it. That alone put so much pressure off of me I was getting complements on my kissing skills ten minutes later. 

As for the actual part... 
Go for multiple small kisses, with second or two long and same time in between. Try new things. Kiss whatever part of her you want (and she lets you). Taste her like you'd taste new food. Find what she likes the most. Don't focus on her lips only, neck and ear are also important.

Not that I've had so many kisses, but I also had my first kiss at 19, and I know exactly what you want to know.

Ok first off don't make my mistake of thinking sucking face means you need to steal the air out of her lungs, now for the step by step.

1. kiss on the lips, tilt head slightly to avoid bumping noses.

2. go up and down with your lips in sync with her lips, now here is where it gets tricky, some girls like tongue, some like lips.

3. When mouth is slightly open either A. go for top or bottom to lip to gently nibble or suck gently, just the tip of the lips though, don't fit the full lip in your mouth or B. go for tongue, mouth is very slightly open at this point and you are just rubbing the tip of your tongue on her tongue.

4. If you did A. go for B if you did B go for A, this rule isn't set in stone, be attentive to what she likes

5. Ok its getting hot and heavy now, windows in the car have started fogging, when looping back to step 2 you want to get that mouth open wide VERY IMPORTANT PART HERE >> as your mouth opens more, tilt your head more or you will bump teeth, your heads should come to a close to 90 degree angle. You are consistently going for more lip/tongue along the way, or whatever feels right, if in doubt do what she is doing. Don't forget to be getting yourself some booty and boobies at some point

6. Don't be afraid to come up for air, if the mood is right good time to start taking off her clothes

198,"As someone who lost their mom when I was around 20 and am an only child, it's great to see so far that a lot of the comments are on point for reaching out and comforting your friend. 

Overall, make yourself available and extend your sympathies. 

Something to understand right now, for the next couple of weeks it's going to be a whirlwind for him. To correctly frame in your head, remember that while he lost his dad, it's a ripple effect for everyone else. Like, his mom lost her husband. The grandparents lost their son. Someone lost their best friend. And when a death occurs, the immediate family is the one that generally needs to handle all of this.

One thing I never really knew about a death in the family is how fast everything needs to be figured out afterwards. Of course, there's logistical things people don't talk about usually (death certificates, lots of legal paperwork afterwards) but even just the act of getting to the funeral is a lot. Usually people have funeral directors they can reach out to, but you have to do stuff like figure out what casket to get, where they're going to be buried, the headstone etc. And then there's the actual act of having to get the word out to everyone that this happened in the first place and then dealing with everyone's reactions to that. 

Especially in his situation being an only child, it's the mom and son who have to deal with this. Personally speaking, my dad wasn't in the right state to handle all of this, so I was the one that had to take on a lot of these logistical things. You start to get to this point where you sort of just get into an autopilot mode, focusing on things almost like you've got a homework assignment and have a checklist of go through to reach the finish line.

The reason why I'm giving you this much context is that for a lot of people, they don't understand the other side, and as guys, we rarely ever bring up or are transparent about this stuff. More correctly, it's some heavy shit and very rarely do we decide to revisit these thoughts or find a correct way to formulate it afterwards. 

You're going to reach out to him right. Let him know you'll be there for him and you're sorry for his loss. He could reply back with a simple answer. He could pour his heart out and be devastated. Or, he could just not reply back to you. Whatever the answer is, don't take it personal, and don't try to dig deeper (yet). Why? Because as I just said, there's a LOT of stuff that he needs to figure out, and (another thing people don't like to talk about) a body has to be buried in a certain time frame (cause well... it can decompose) so he's also under pressure to get get this stuff done ASAP. 

Very likely, he's going to be in auto pilot mode. For most guys, we're able to handle this. Sometimes, there are people who can't, and that's okay.

But understand that at this point, you should be there for him for emotional support, but only when he reaches out to you for it. Right now, he needs to stay the course and get his dad in the ground. After that will be him learning to cope with it. But level setting expectations that he might seem distant sometimes.

Cause the other truth people forget about is that as I said above, when a death happens, it affects everyone. What I mean is, you're going to make an effort and comfort him, but there's a very good chance there's a lot of people who are also coming out of the woodwork to do the same. Could be extended family, could be other friends. Could be people he only talked to one a year ago.

I'm a very nice, empathetic people who appreciates everyone around me. But I will say, when my mom passed away, I sort of had this weird reaction towards so many people asking me if I was doing okay and how they were going to be there for me. I think as humans, we just aren't equipped to handle this much outpouring of support, especially when you also remember that you've got the roller coaster of having one of the worst things happen to you, followed up by some of the best humanity needs to offer. 

My reaction was to close myself off and focus on the task. 

Your job is to keep yourself almost on call during these first couple of weeks. Because for me, I was on cruise control. And for a bit, it was fine. But then there's just those random moments on a Thursday night at 1AM when I finally have time to breath and can't sleep. And suddenly, everything I've been deflecting and bottling up comes rushing through me. 

When they reach out to you, it's not going to seem as bombastic. In fact, it might seem odd how casual it might be sometimes. Just a simple ""Hey, what are you doing right now?"" or ""Hey, want to go grab a bite with me?"" But don't ignore this call for help, because as innocent as that might seem, it's usually mean being at a breaking point and needing help.

If this happens to you and you're hanging out with your friend, be there and don't try to start anything. Meaning don't ask anything, don't bring anything up first. Let your friend be the one to vent and open up and just continue to listen and let them talk through all of these things in their head and allow them to let it all out.

This is important, don't try to give ""answers"" or try to fix anything. Death is something that can't really be solved. On top of that, it's something that is going to live with him for the rest of his life. It's now been almost a decade since my mom passed away, and there's nothing that will ever fix that, or have me truly learn to get over it. The only solution that's acceptable is my mom not being dead, and of course I understand that's unreasonable. Additionally, having a death in the family usually causes ""adult"" problems to surface. Things like family drama, finances, lots of things that were always ignored or swept under the rug that need to be solved. I'm sure you're smart enough to understand that this isn't a wise thing to try to offer an opinion up on. 

The goal is to be there for your friend on call until the funeral happens. This is when the dust settles, and like it or not, life has to go on. For me, it meant flying back to my college town and heading to class again; leaving my dad to deal with his own demons. It's not clean, and for sure you don't just integrate yourself back into life so easily after this. But it's necessary. 

Depending on how good a friend you are, I'll give you a final perspective that people rarely talk about when someone extremely close to them passes away.

I think the part that frustrated me the most at first was seeing just how... normal life was after my mom was buried. This is a life altering thing for me and while it was nice to have such a large amount of support within those two-three weeks, only to just have everyone go back to their lives. I know it's not their intention, but when you're on the receiving end of something like this, you almost thing that no one cares after that initial event. 

This eats at you. Because while I know for the people who I care about the most, they understand how devastating it to me. But the harsh reality of how the life is, is that the world just needs to keep turning and now your friend wakes up each day with a little piece of them gone. The part that most normal people get who haven't had this happen, is that there's not supposed to be a solution for this. For most humans, we have a problem in our life, and there's usually a solution for it. While sure, we have varying degrees of ""success"", there's a huge amount of things that can be solved in one way or another.

Death isn't one of those things. As I said before, the only way that you can fix this type of problem is for my mom not to be dead. And because of this, you sort of get into this weird groove where you just have a big part of your life not there anymore, and there's nothing that can fix that part. 

If this sounds sad, well it is. But as I explained before, you learn to live with this, because one, my mom (and his dad) would probably want them to continue to live their lives and be happy, and I make sure to honor my mom by living my life to the fullest. Since her passing, I went and graduated college, ended up getting my dream job and am now at the point where I can financially support my dad when he needs it. 

Does it suck to me to think that my mom was not there to witness these things? For sure. But in my mind, I think that she loved me enough to raise me the right way and every day I see myself having parts of her, from the way I look to the way I act she's always a part of me everyday. And I also know that if I always remember her (despite it hurting) she's never really gone. 

Your friend is going to feel these same things, and has to go through their own journey to ultimately find peace. The best thing you can do is be there for him and make sure to support, but not solve. 

There's going to be random times where he'll bring up his dad. You'll ask him how he's holding up, and he'll eventually reach a point where he learns to white lie and say he's doing okay, when he really isn't. This is just part of the process for it.

But I will let you know that even though it's been the better part of a decade since my mom passed away, I still remember everyone who was looking out for me and supported me throughout the good and bad times. Mad props to you for wanting to help out with this man. ",0

I loved this cat like you wouldn't believe, he'd fetch hair ties if you shot them across the room- he'd chase them down, bring it most of the way back, drop it and mow at you until you take a step, grab it, and do it again.  I'd leave the door open on sunny days until a big fly came in the house just so I could see him run around and catch it.  Lazers were his bitch.  The guy could jump six feet in the air, no problem.  He'd jump onto my shoulder any time I had my heavy coat on, and ride there (I'm 6'5"").  We actually thought he was mute because he didn't make a single sound until about three months after adoption- he got into the garbage (prompting us to buy a different trashcan) and when I went to shower him, he lets loose with this enormous ROWR that shocked the hell out of all of us, including him.  From that moment on, he was talkative as all hell, but still hated showers.

How to Train Your Dragon was OUR movie.  Not just my movie, ours.  He would sit and watch it with me.  Not just look at the screen, or just cuddle on my lap, he would *watch* the movie, follow the dragons in action.  Weirdest thing I ever saw.  That, on top of me swearing for years that the animators kidnapped my cat just to study him for the movie's animation, just made it ours.  We must have watched it twenty times in a year.  When my wife would go out with her friends, I used to watch kung-fu movies because she didn't care for them, but once HTTYD was on DVD, that was it.  I'd flip it on, he'd join me, and we'd chill together.

Three years ago, Jack passed away, December 23rd.  Traumatic kidney failure- no one knew, there were no indicators, and we discovered after the fact that someone had fed the poor guy antifreeze when he was younger (we adopted him as an adult).  We spent every cent of our savings, every minute of our time, for six weeks, trying to help him, and nothing worked.  We finally ran out of everything, and brought him home. One morning he looked at me and I could tell he was asking to be let go.  He was ours for five amazing years.  

I've only managed to get through How to Train Your Dragon once since then, and that was Monday.  Every other time the memories just hurt too much to continue.  I miss him so much that I'm sitting at my work right now trying to not cry typing this out.  This last Christmas, my wife got me a handmade Toothless plushie, in memoriam.  I love that she understands.  

I'd trade every penny I've ever spent on every game I've ever bought, if I could only take the time I spent on them and have my cat back.

204,"Well for me, I had to get out more. I've had social anxiety my whole life but a couple years ago after a rough patch in my life, I got hit with panic attacks and anxiety. I would stay in my house for weeks at a time, never saw my friends, was scared to go out for fear of anixety. I started to work out from home, that helped. Then I started walking more, even just going to the mailbox at the end of the road. The first time I really went out was maybe 2-3 months after my first panic attack, I booked a hair cut and forced myself to go. I would be lying if I said it was easy, I felt like vomiting and passing out the whole time. But once I had achieved that, I felt amazing. That was kind of the first step of many steps towards getting my life back in order. 

I started really focusing on my health, I gained weight because I was so underweight and I worked out. Tried sleeping on a better schedule, taking vitamins etc. It's been almost 3 years since my first panic attack and I feel pretty good. Back then, I never thought I would ever get back to normal. I think one of the most important things to do is talk to professionals, get help, don't do it alone. Places like /r/anxiety and their discord server are fantastic resources, but they don't replace a therapist. I wish I had gone to therapy when I was in a really bad state. ",0
205,"42m.  My dad passed away in June (father's day..) from a rare form of cancer, he had been given 3 months to live and they nailed it. To deal with it, I took the next 3 days off of work and sat by myself at my computer and put together into one directory all of the photos I had of him. I cried randomly for 2 days. Then I had to start making phone calls to notify all our friends and family. I cried some more but it really helped to talk to other people about it and I got all these great stories (fuck me, I'm starting to tear up typing this - keep it together) about him that I had never heard before. 

I started writing down bullet points about his life that I wanted to talk about when I spoke at the funeral. At this point after a couple days I was ready to be around other people again (besides my wife and 3 boys of course). 

Next thing you know, there are a million things you have to do and you're so busy booking funeral things and organizing and hosting people and planning and worrying about probate and legal stuff that you lose yourself for a week. You can think about them without breaking down by this point. You go back to work, life starts to move on. You think about them every single day from that point forward in your life. Everything reminds you of them. At first it hurts and then, over time, it starts to warm you a little.. because it helps you remember them. Eventually, months later you reflect on the time you did this or that and smile to yourself wishing you'd said something or other. 

I can't speak to further out than that, but, that's kind of how it goes. Just accept the feelings as they come, don't fight them, don't have conversations with them in your head at first.

If he can talk, ask him what he wants done (holy crap am I glad I did this.. it was not what we had planned to do at all). Tell him not to worry. Tell him that you guys will be ok. ",0
206,"I always knew mine was going to die relatively young, so in a sense I had years to prepare. He suffered from a progressive neurological disorder that slowly ravaged his body until he died when I was 20. He was in his mid-50s at the time and died in his sleep at home. I still remember the following morning and the days that followed with unusual clarity. It was a strange time and I was more numb than anything else. Having family and friends around helped, and for whatever reason so did taking the lead in organizing his funeral. I would say don't be afraid to lean on those close to you during this time, and avoid isolating yourself too much. Losing someone you love and admire is going to be horribly painful no matter what you do, but the common refrain that it'll get easier with time is very true. Nothing will ever replace them, but we can learn to adjust to life without them and with every passing year we can get better at it. ",0
207,"I admit up front I won't be the most relatable answer here.

My father has never been around by choice and lives on the fringe of society. I don't know him, nor do I care to.

I was raised by my grandparents and my grandfather did his best in old age to be a strong male figure. I knew even as a boy that I would likely lose him early in life and began preparing emotionally when I was in my teens. When the time came, I sat with him and, despite him being occasionally incoherent or irascible due to dementia, I found a great deal of humanity in him that had never been revealed to me until that time. 

I told him exactly how much he meant to me and recounted my most significant memories of our life together to him. In his moments of clarity, I asked him which times he remembered most fondly and listened, and tried to transport him to happier days. 

To this day, I've never cried over his loss. I think I handled his last days and passing better than any other challenge in my life and I'm happy that he knew how I felt about him and what his existence meant for mine.

Because you don't have adequate time to prepare, I personally would do what feels right, just as long as you face mortality alongside of him. You know your dad well enough that you'll be able to make a lot out of whatever time there is. We all acquiesce to death eventually, but that doesn't mean that it can't be met with dignity and conquered. 

We have faith in you, man.",0

I promise you he can hear you. No matter what happens, the people we love never really leave us, even though they are physically gone. Wishing you peace at this time. ",0
209,"My dad died February of 2016, I was 35 at the time, losing my mentor, best friend was the worst experience I've ever gone through. Especially losing him to pancreatic cancer, which is usually quick but his dragged on for 18 months and watched him become a man who was completely unrecognizable. This was the hardest part watching a man who was full of life, humour, dreams (1.5 years post retired at 62) disappear in the blink of an eye.  When he finally did pass away, it was a sense of relief, relief that he was no longer suffering, but the hole that his passing has left behind has been massive.

I tried to fill that hole with booze. I do not recommend this, the only things that has done has made me feel shittier, depressed, strained my relationship with my soon to be ex fiancee.  I thought I was ok with everything, and going to the bar and knocking back 6-10 pints 3 times a week was ""normal"" and a good way to ""cope"".  It isn't and it has only made things worse in my life. I had my last drink on December 29th and dont plan on drinking today or the foreseeable future.

210,"Honestly, I'm not really sure if I've really dealt with it. He died back in August after a traffic accident. However, I live in the US, and he and my mom had moved back to Taiwan back in April. Even before then, I had moved out for about a year and a half prior. I guess we had kinda grew apart in the meantime. My sister called me at 10PM to tell me that they had been in an accident, but they didn't know how bad it was yet. Then at 2AM, she called again to tell me it was bad, that he was possibly brain dead, and that I should get over ASAP, so I booked the earliest flight I could find, shot an e-mail to HR and my supervisor, and was on a plane to Taiwan at 9AM.

My mom had a broken leg and cracked ribs and a clavicle, so my sister (who had moved to Taiwan 3ish years ago) and so I stayed about 3 weeks to help care for her. While I was there, I forced myself to hold it together, and after I got home, it was already just kinda dulled. Out of sight, out of mind I guess. Every once in a while, I'll be doing something which makes me think of my dad, and then it's like ""Oh...  Right... He's gone... I've never get to see him again..."" and then I just kinda stop myself there and move on with my day. Seeing my mom's grief when we took her to see him before he passed, and then again when we told her we was gone was more heart-wrenching than my dad actually passing.

216,"Do you know what’s causing the elevated pressure? If it’s your weight, lose it.

218,"Damn, this one hits close to home. 

When I was 19 and just starting out in college my mother and grandmother died in quick succession. Felt like I was in a daze for the next few months and ended up failing a few of my classes. Decided to put the brakes on everything and ended up moving home to work with my dad for a semester. He owns a software development company and I was going for my degree in computer science so it worked out pretty well. The pay was horrible though so one day a couple months into the job I went into his office and started listing off all the reasons why I should get a raise. I ended it with something along the lines of “And that’s why I think the work I’m doing is worth $15 / hr” to which he replied “I agree, bring me another offer and I’ll beat it”. Pissed me off so much but it was exactly what I needed then. Signed back up for classes. That was about 5 years ago now and I’ll be graduating with a degree in Computer Science this May. I’ve also accepted a job offer and will be moving come July.

Some big picture stuff I learned:

-	Your mother passing away is huge. Sounds obvious but things began to get a lot better for me mentally when I started being more honest with myself about just how much I’d lost and how hurt and broken I still was. 
-	A lot of what I was interpreting as judgment of my progress was really just rooted in my own insecurities and fears about the future. 
-	Be very careful with the language you use in your own head. When you find yourself thinking “I should be X” or “I need to be Y” try to stop yourself and pick it apart. There are so many ways to live a life and the idea that there’s objectively a better one you should be living is ridiculous in my opinion. 


Some day to day stuff:

-	Try to go to therapy if you’re not in it already. If your life feels as blown to pieces as mine felt you’re going to need help navigating it. 
-	Dont let the small details of your life get overshadowed by the big stuff. Staying hydrated, eating healthy, exercising and staying in touch with friends go a long way toward keeping the larger goals of your life in focus. 
-	Find kindred spirits. I was very depressed and alone so a lot of this for me was done through books and documentaries. By chance I ended up watching The Roosevelts: An Intimate History by Ken Burns and I immediately gravitated to TR. The story of him losing his wife and mother on the same day and how he dealt with it really resonated with me. 


I’m sorry if this was long and all over the place. If you ever need to talk just message me. Head up, you’ve got this. ",0
219,"I'm a Buddhist. Our funeral rituals last for four days. I'd only ever attended western / Christian funerals before my great grandmother died a few years ago. Four days. On the first day, we had to kneel on the ground and the monks and nuns recited the Infinite Life Sutra for four hours, taking breaks to ring the singing bowl which meant we had to prostrate our heads to the ground. On the second day, we knelt for another two hours, chanting the Rebirth Mantra over and over, doing prostrations between each one. On the third day, my great grandmother's only surviving son had to participate in an offerings ceremony while the rest of the family knelt on the ground and prostrated. A monk gave us a dharma talk afterward. On the fourth day, we cremated her.

And then we had to observe vegetarianism for 49 days and perform meritorious rituals in which we would dedicate the karmic merit of our actions to my great grandmother's rebirth in the Pure Land (where she will study under Amitabha Buddha until she attains nirvana and escapes birth and death). On the 49th day, we held a [ceremony](http://i.imgur.com/WWAIrce.jpg) where we made her favorite foods and invited her, and any other wandering ghosts and spirits, to come feast with us. After the incense burned down, we (the living) joined in with eating (the idea is that the ghosts have until the incense burns down to ""eat"") and practice mindfulness of death, reflecting on the deceased, so it is like we are sharing a meal with them. This mindfulness-of-death ceremony is something my family now does every year on the anniversary of my great grandmother's death (and sometimes whenever my mother has a dream that tells her to prepare the feast again).

This whole experience was very transformative for me. My great grandmother was the woman who raised me, and spending so much time grieving for her meant I *really* grieved for her. It was an incredibly powerful experience and I appreciate that we come back to it every year and dedicate part of our minds to remembering our past loved ones, inviting them to join us if possible, and if not, at least extending warmth and compassion not only to them but to any and all ghosts.

My brother, who is much less religious than I am, told me recently that he still doesn't think he's come to terms with her death. And I felt really really bad for him. I hope he gets there someday. I hope our practice of ritual eventually helps and he can see their merit.",0

I don't know what's wrong with me because I act the part and petend to care but I really don't know how to, everything I feel and express in this life is meaningless because over the process of time passing it will all be ancient and forgotten anyway, in the grand scheme of things everything that we care about is meaningless just like our lives and nothing we do really matters.",0

225,"> But why does it seem women have a double standard towards men?

I'm not sure what you mean. In person, if I ask a woman about this, she won't gravitate towards the ""hot"" fit guy, she'll tend to give a non-answer. I suspect because she doesn't want to get in an argument with the man who asks her. But when you ask women online, who have some anonymity, they usually are honest, they prefer the ""hot"" guys. And studies agree with this. 

Anyway, now that I'm fit, I get more looks from women, but zero dates. I always ask them out on a first date 100% of the time. 
Just because a guys is fit does not mean a girl will ask him out. 
YMMV. 

As a skinny, fit person with high blood pressure, I'm probably  more at risk for a heart attack than a guy who has an extra 30 lbs. But I'm just guessing. I'd love to see a risk comparison though, as I otherwise eat healthy and work out 6-7 days a week.

She's a very fragile and insanely emotional girl, I am basically a stump that can talk. Things work between us for the most part, but she is super clingy and I like to have my own time and do things with friends from time to time. The way she has demanded attention constantly has stopped me from talking to my friends much at all in the last year or so. 

My friend just rented a house in Cape Cod for vacation and invited me to come along for free. I told her that I'm definitely going. I have not told my SO yet because this same situation happened last year and my friend accidentally brought it up at a party they invited us to and my girlfriend didn't know yet because I hadn't told her. She freaked out because I was planning something behind her back and we almost broke up over it. 

She has severe anxiety and depression. Also a heart condition where her heart gives out under high stress. She has had a few heart attacks because of panic attacks already. I had to learn CPR for her because she's so overly emotional and unstable that these situations come up regularly.

I need a fucking vacation. I have done nothing but work, study, and cater to my girlfriends feelings for a year and a half now and blew my last chance at a vacation. 

The ultimatum for me is: I am going to go on vacation with my friends regardless of what my girlfriend wants. I don't know how to approach her about it yet because I'm afraid she will completely fly off the handle and try to kill herself or something.",0

If not she is either a suicidal moron or simply doesn't have a heart problem (you know that panic attacks can present almost identical to heart attacks right?). 

Edit: if she is being responsible with her health, then you need to tell her that her current level of therapy isn't cutting it and she needs to talk to her psychologist/psychiatrist about treatments aimed at emotional regulation and appropriate responses to emotions. I'd highly recommend cognitive or dialectical behavioral therapy. 

As for this specific problem, simply tell her matter-of-factly, don't ask permission, and again suggest she call her therapist or other doctors if she starts freaking out.",0

The worst part was the numbing needle, which wasn't even bad. No worse than those things you prick your finger with when they need a blood sample. Of course, it's your balls, so you naturally panic. I went into (very) mild shock. Got that cold shiver, hands got numb, and I got a little cold sweat. Mostly nerves, because of the area being operated on. That passed in 10 minutes. Take a Valium beforehand.

The biggest thing is to go to a urologist. Do not just go to the hospital and get some random doc. Go to a specialist with his own office/staff, etc.. My doc was the top doc in the state, and had well over 1000 snips credited to him. 

Do not drive yourself home. While the surgery itself is nothing, any surgery will shock the area. the best way I can describe it is, it is like a hernia. All the muscles in your torso attach right above your dick, and they are going to get inflamed. Inflamed = easier to tear, and driving is almost all core muscle work. Don't pick up more than a gallon of milk for a week, so you aren't stressing the muscle tendons. No running, walk slow. No jumping jacks. If you can, get the snip Thursday evening, take off Friday and Monday and sit around and watch TV with a frozen bag of peas. Don't get up too often. After the initial 4-5 days, things get easier, and driving is sore, but easier (taking a dump sucks those days, just go easy). 

But don't do anything for another two weeks. Of my friends that got snipped, a lot of them had complications because they started being active too early. One picked up his 50lb kid, and blew out his groin, and to go to the hospital. The groin handles so much of your body, it takes longer for the inflammation to go down all the way in that area, because as hard as you try to keep off it, it gets worked all the time. You do not want to tear that area.

I had zero problems. I didn't even finish the pain pills. Took them for two days and then, nah, don't need them. Finish your antibiotics though. After 3 months, I was on the quad, lifting weights again, and all that stuff, no problems. I could have gone back to that stuff earlier, but I felt no need to rush. Give yourself extra time.

Seriously though, I don't believe those of us with a family history has any choice in the matter. My father had a quad in his late 50's. He was/is 5'6"" 120 pounds soaking wet. He is an avid martial artist and eats relatively well (an occasional hefty steak) and drinks a glass of wine a night (better than the cognac when he was younger). After his heart attack he ate even better and still had a second one in his 60's. 

My father's dad, grandfather, and brother have all had heart attacks. My mom's father and brothers all had heart attacks. I have **no hope** of not having one soon (I'm in my late 40's). 

This doesn't count the family type 2 diabetes. Everyone except my father and mother have it on both sides. And no, they aren't all fat. We just don't make the cut for Type 1. 

IMHO: It comes down to how you recover from family illness and not will you have it. My dad is still super active. To the point my brother and I yell it him to slow down and let us do it for him.

Several of his family members have similar stories as well.

I felt an impending sense of sheer doom - for no apparent reason, beyond the fact that my pulse was racing and I felt like I was going to die.  I went to the ER, thinking I was having a heart attack.  The ER doctor confirmed that I was not having a heart attack, but suspected an anxiety attack.  $2000 dollars later, and 1 refill for Ativan 5 mg, I have managed to live another 5 years without making the same mistake twice, and without having my insurance company discover that I probably have an undiagnosed anxiety disorder, that I control with meditation, exercise and sparing use of that same refill of Ativan (which has long since surpassed its expiration date).",0

I'll be honest I dwell on my flaws and failures a lot. I'm also quite self-critical.

It took my final exams to get me to stop obsessing about it. Now it's starting to come back, since I'm at home a lot this summer while waiting for more shifts at work and sussing out the next steps of my career path. 

It's a lot easier when I'm out with friends or otherwise occupied, though.

3) Taken. My difficulty is that I find it had to believe in my ability when I'm expecting myself to achieve 2 often contradictory things. 

The simplest example (and this has driven me INSANE throughout A Levels and uni):

-To be a hot guy I need to get/keep in shape, to do that I need to work out and watch what I eat (hotness varying on discipline) 

-To be a good son I need to please my mum, considering that my mum appeared to be upset by my new interest in dieting, to please my mum I have to eat as much crap as possible and avoid the gym at all costs

but to be a 'good man' (whatever that means) I need to do both. If I'm out of shape and can't attract I've failed; if I'm IN shape and making my mum worry I'm obsessed, I've also failed. Can't win!

It's only been this last year that that changed. Actually, yesterday my mum knocked at  my dad's and sad she'd restarted swimming to get in shape. That was when I realised, ""Yay my mum doesn't hate/cry about me being a gym bunny! She just wants me to be happy!""

Another example is: 

-in order to attract I need to be well-rested, in order to do that I need plenty sleep and early nights

-in order to be fun and outgoing I need to regularly stay out late, basically not stay in most nights, forgo sleep AND NOT GET TIRED. It's important that I prove that I can go without sleep and still be a really fun, charismatic, laid-back, cheerful guy. 

It's never worked. All it does is make me act like I'm drunk. One time I went to a party after staying up all night, and I nearly fell on the bowling alley mid-swing. Also it tends to make me very passive and sometimes depressed. Also it's plain dangerous. 


I'm beating myself up for stupid things like not being able to smoke weed or go without sleep for 48 hours without it triggering paranoia. I've seen my friends do it-even drinking-and they haven't ended up with issues, have they? So why did I? It feels like my weakness. I shouldn't stigmatise myself for taking care of my mind with a condition but apparently I do. Maybe that is low self esteem again.

I don't know why but it seems to be me taking the whole 'man up' thing to a toxic level. They're not even productive, they're some constant trials of manhood for the sheer sake of it that only has a detrimental impact on my life.  

I've been told these are strings of false dichotomies: never having cake again, eating a whole cake with every meal; never resting my eyes again, never having a late night again...Oh and stupid and dangerous 'trials' too. 

It's 3am, I'm falling to sleep and thinking a date is going to dump me because I can't smoke weed without it messing with my head is sounding pretty dumb. And fucked up. Women can have high standards and odd deal breakers but THAT is just a Spanish Inquisition.

Still believe it though..

I just get pissed off with myself that I can't handle mind-altering substances and sleep deprivation without having some terrifying break from reality and loss of control.

Break ups happen. You learn from them and move on. I know--easier said than done, but that's what you have to do. You can try to find hobbies to take up your time so that you're not obsessing over her. Eventually, there will be days that you won't even think about her.

>-To be a good son I need to please my mum, considering that my mum appeared to be upset by my new interest in dieting, to please my mum I have to eat as much crap as possible and avoid the gym at all costs

You don't think this is bullshit? What if your mom was displeased that you didn't come home with ten freshly killed little kids? Are you all of the sudden going to start killing kids to be the ""good son""? Fuck no. So why are you valuing her opinion when her beliefs about exercising and eating right is completely skewed?

>-in order to be fun and outgoing I need to regularly stay out late, basically not stay in most nights, forgo sleep AND NOT GET TIRED. It's important that I prove that I can go without sleep and still be a really fun, charismatic, laid-back, cheerful guy.

Uh, no you don't. What made you believe that you have to be a night owl to have fun? Does ""fun"" only happen past midnight or something? Are you only considered to be outgoing if you're staying up well into the night only to be dead tired the next day?

You have other priorities in your life, such as work. Anyone who puts partying late into the night over that is simply irresponsible. And if you're going to work out you're going to *need* rest.

There are plenty of ways to be social and have fun without staying up past midnight.

>It's never worked. All it does is make me act like I'm drunk. One time I went to a party after staying up all night, and I nearly fell on the bowling alley mid-swing. Also it tends to make me very passive and sometimes depressed. Also it's plain dangerous.

'K. Then don't party. Or better yet, know your limits.

You have a pretty skewed definition of what it means to be a ""man"".

How about this:

* Watch your health

* Be social

* Be confident

* Take responsibility

* Don't be a dick

* Have fun

* Find ways to improve yourself

Stop obsessing over being ""manly"".

If a date is going to dump you because you don't smoke weed, then who the fuck cares? Are you *that* so fucking hung over her looks that you're willing to look past the obvious fact that you guys are definitely not compatible and that she may be a immature bitch for dumping you over something so small?

The readings were off so the nurse left to get the doctor, doctor tried it and it didn’t work again so he asked me to see a specialist. The specialist used a more elaborate ekg system I think and same shit happened again so they put me on a table with my shirt off, called in like 10 doctors to stand around and see what was goin on and they gave me an ultra sound over my heart. I think what was wrong was that nerves or branches or something on the right side of my heart weren’t firing correctly, or off beat or something which causes ekg’s to get miss readings.

He had his wife, kids, grand kids etc. but he had been alone without his siblings or parents for several years. He was a veteran, first time he ever showed that much emotion.

A second co worker chimed in on he barely reacted to his dad passing but the minute his mother passed away he nearly committed suicide since in his words “my angel left me”. 

It kinda came together since at the time I worked in a union job and we had a large group of older unions members. All of them had stories of what it was like. It filled me at first with a sad dread of reality. But something about it was comforting.

As far as the pain, regret, remorse, anger, sadness and whatever strong emotion you might feel that won’t go away. I couldn’t go to my families thanksgiving the first year when he passed. I couldn’t listen to certain songs since they were his favorite and if by chance someone else was playing it i would just freeze and forget what I was doing. Radio always off when I drive.

Like when I was a kid and wanted a pb and J and we didn’t have bread but we had English muffins. So I toasted it and went to town, my dad stopped me said it was stupid then asked me to make him one.

My mom told me one of the last things he ate before he passed was a toasted English muffin pb and j and that it was the weirdest thing he asked for as a snack.
I never told my brother or sisters or mom that story. I didn’t know until he died that he would still have them.

The smell, sound, or sight of English muffins overwhelms me still.",0

288,"Welllll it took three different doctors and two hospitals six years to actually diagnose me with a cardiac problem.

Yeah. I’d go in with chest pain, back pain, left arm numb.

They ER’s would hook me up to EKG machines, do x-rays, draw blood... and then send me home saying I wasn’t having a heart attack.

The Docs would have me run on treadmills with EKG machines... and then send me home saying I wasn’t having a heart attack.

Stomach docs would prescribe more and more stomach meds that consistently didn’t work.

Finally after six years a *nurse*, watching me run in pain on a treadmill and an EKG machine (with normal EKG), said “You know what? I’m tellin that doc you need a nuclear stress test.”

Thankfully the doc agreed because the nuke found an “abnormality” on the left side of my heart.

The cardiac cath showed that “abnormality” to be a 99% block of the LAD (The Widowmaker).

One big ass metal soda straw later and I’m climbing up stairs and bicycling pain free.

But not symptomatic free.

I still get the same symptoms I had before, just not after exercise.

Turns out the nerves for “you’re having a heart attack” pain *are the exact* same nerves for “you’re having bad indigestion” pain.

Know what causes indigestion besides bad sushi?

Anxiety that’s what.

Anxiety and stress cause acid buildup and GERD and esophagitis.

Which causes more anxiety because everytime I go to the ER they draw blood, take an X-ray, hook me up to an EKG machine...and send me home sayin “You’re not having a heart attack”.

Here’s what I’ve learned about cardiac problems:

If you want to save someone’s life, carry chewable aspirin with you.

Aspirin and CPR has almost an order of magnitude better success rate over CPR alone.

Do Not just start taking aspirin without talking to a doc.
Even 81mg aspirin can mess you up over the long term.

STOP EATING SO MUCH SUGAR

No really. Sugar irritates the arterial walls and allows for cholesterol to collect on the walls.

I know. Its tough finding any food in a box or bottle which doesn’t have “added sugar” but it’s doable.

Alcohol counts as sugar.

Get up and move.

Go for walks.

Bike.


Fuck for a healthy heart.

Ok I’m done now.

314,"Wall of text, but felt like giving a complete answer:

tl;dr- if you feel pushed rather than pushing yourself, there is no point.

I am losing weight now due to certain issues, and while I was never super big (although technically well into obese category), this kind of question has been on my mind lately.

The truth is: I love food. I love the taste. I love the experience of tasting, feeling various textures, etc. I love the warmth and comfort of a full belly, especially gathered with other people. My only self-control is my standards that the food be made how it should be. Flavor is filling.

Even as I type this, my goal is to overcome my issues enough to allow me a piece of red-velvet cheesecake from a restaurant I frequent.

When I wasn't losing weight, it was because I didn't see a benefit in avoiding foods that I like, even for health reasons. I'd rather have a heart attack and choke eating my favorite foods than live trapped in a joy deprived life like a rabbit in a cage.

Everyone is afraid of dying, but what's the point if you are afraid to live. For me to lose weight, I have had to learn how to love life in more active ways and learn I can enjoy foods in small quantities and not just overwhelm my senses with the joy of overwhelming my body.",0
315,"Losing weight is one of the most difficult things anyone can ever do. I'm in the process of losing weight even though I still have a lot of it. It takes incredible discipline and planning in order to lose weight consistentlyn and even then most people are losing about 1-2 lbs a week. Some weeks you'll stay the same or even go up a little bit. All of these factors just drain the motivation away when you're at a restaurant choosing between salad and the double cheeseburger. And even once you hit the target weight, it only takes a few weeks to gain a good chunk of it back. 

I didn't start for a long time because I just didn't care. I was doing well in college, made the Dean's list consistently, had a girlfriend for about 2 years, and was getting some great internships. I never felt unathletic, since I played intramurals consistently and walked a lot. Nobody ever made fun of me for being fat, so that wasn't an issue. Overall I was lucky enough to have a lot of friends who saw past my weight and just saw me as an interesting person to be around. 

Now that I've moved to a brand new state, single, and without homework to do every night, I find the motivation is starting to appear. The motivation is there to go to the gym or for a run, while in the past I would just play video games or go to a bar. I have more control of what I eat, even though I still get tempted at the store. But a month in and the results are minimal. I think a few pounds are gone, but weight fluctuates more in fat people so I can't say exactly how much I've lost. You have to really be ready for a long stretch of feeling hungry and forcing yourself to exercise in order to see any results.

Losing weight takes a lot of dedication. I put my dedication in to other things at the moment, like my social life and work. Also, i seem to consistently be able to date attractive girls. 

That being said I'm not happy with my shape right now so i will be changing my diet next week after i come back from vacation. I need to lose 10-15kg or so. I'm going ulta low calorie, high protein. It works for me, haters gonna hate.",0

* I have a degenerative physical disability that makes it much harder to exercise then it was 5 years ago.

I **know** I need to drop 40lbs, but it would really be only for aesthetic purposes. My blood pressure, cholesterol, etc are all good, I don't have any cardiovascular issues or health issues outside the scope of my disability.

Exercise isn't so difficult; providing you're able bodied it doesnt take much to walk off maybe 300-400 calories per day. The issue for me is being consistent with my eating. 

It's only once you really start dieting that you become aware of all the everyday social shit that impacts it. Want to go out drinking with your mates? Better stay on the rum & diet cokes. Going out for dinner with your partner? Get ready for your calorie intake for that day to be screwed. Someone's birthday/retirement/leaving at work and there's cake?

I watched my father-in-law lose his eyesight, then the needle like pain shooting through his feet as he started losing those.   
I watched him descend into madness at being alone in the ""dark"". Helped my wife and mother-in-law pick him up off the floor, after a mild heart attack, so when the paramedics arrived they could easily access him. I heard him cry out in pain when a sudden stroke caused him to bite through his tongue. And I was there in the hospital room when the second stroke made him a vegetable.   
He died soon after that, thankfully.  
  
Now I am watching my dad start down the same path. He's in much better healthy than FiL was and is much older. But, knowing what lies ahead of him and, eventually me, scares the shit out of me.

I'd say it's been 75% about the diet and 25% about the exercise.

I use myfitnesspal.  It's an app that helps you track and count calories.  I got a food scale and I weigh/measure what I cook and eat.

The app came up with a suggested calorie target for a 2lb/week loss.  I tried to follow it as close as I could and also not eat back any calories I ""earned"" from working out.  This target goes down as you lose (because you are burning less calories at lower weight) but I cut it at 1800 calories a day.  That's what I've been eating for awhile and I don't want to go lower than that with my relatively good amount of activity.

It's hard, but the system works it's all about CICO (calories in < calories out).

(1) Some people do actually have lower metabolisms than the averages those numbers are based on.

If your number and record keeping is right, it doesn't matter what someone says you *should* be able to eat, just what you know you actually *can* eat.

(2) How are you sleeping? My experience is actually on the other end, a low weight person who has trouble eating and has to focus on weight maintenance from the other side of the coin. Sleep is really key, for me, for burning fat. When I'm going through a period when I can't eat and have to burn fat stores, I don't do that well at all if I don't sleep. Each time I wake up, I have an energy boost and the scale's gone down. If you aren't sleeping enough, that could be shooting your metabolic processes in the foot. ",0

Genetics dictate I might get diabetes if I didn't get healthier, as well as some heart pills if I'm not careful by 45. Should I keep avoiding cholesterol like the plague (like trans fats)? Or is there a good level of cholesterol to have?

So, two eggs in the morning, at least every other day, won't really hurt you in that department. In fact, dietary cholesterol is critical for production of hormones, such as testosterone.

Your blood cholesterol levels are affected by your consumption of fats. Keep your intake of sat fats down and focus on consuming a good amount of soluble fiber in order to keep your cholesterol levels under control.

And on the topic of fiber, I don't know how much you already consume on average, but more soluble and insoluble fiber probably won't hurt. It is another tool to help keep you feeling full, and is critical in the digestion process. So, don't shy away from those vegetables and oats.

My Doctor would ask me if I’m sexually active, but I would be the one to ask for STD testing. Perhaps she would have offered it if I didn’t ask, who knows. 


Now as a nurse I work in a hospital with many different doctors, some are gung ho about ordering every test and taking on every case. Other doctors are much more realistic and cost effective when it comes to limiting unnecessary interventions. Both of them are right in their own way. So with your doctor you can either get more comfortable speaking up (as I had to do with my family doc) or seek out a different doctor who may have a different personality. ",0
338,"A lot of, if not most, doctors are not going to order tests unless there is a reason to do so (ie: you have a symptom or a family history of symptoms.) Your stable healthy vital signs and lack of complaints of symptoms would indicate you don’t need investigation into other testing. 



If you’d like to have cholesterol tested otherwise then you should ask her. You can ask for a standard blood testing panel (things like complete blood cell count, electrolytes) as a baseline if you like. If you have a health diet, you are young and are symptom free with no family history of high cholesterol, then there is zero reason why your family doctor would offer a cholesterol test without prompting from you. ",0
339,"As someone who works in health care: My confidence in my own GP is like... 7/10. She's kind of apathetic but seems to know her stuff for the most part. I feel like she should take my migraines more seriously, and a few years back when I developed white spots all over my skin she was convinced I had vitiligo. Even after I found a very common fungal skin infection and said ""This is what it is, this is the drug I need"" she wrote me a script but said ""I still think it's vitiligo."" Guess what? The spots went away. 

GPs are good resources to get referrals and deal with minor complaints. They're also a good way to build a medical history to have passed on to hospitals when you do get sick. 

However I find that some people place way too much confidence in their GP. They're still human, they aren't infallible or a robotic encyclopedia. I've had too many people say ""Well my doctor told me [totally incorrect thing here]"" and oftentimes that totally incorrect thing is a common misconception or based on old medical assumptions that were debunked 20 years ago. Some doctors are stubborn, some just don't know current info on every medical problem ever, some have biases...  so people should always be down for a second opinion. ",0
340,"My mother is a GP.

She believes in homeopathy.

She still believes that saturated fat causes heart disease.

When I was a child, she would give me antibiotics for basically anything that didn't go away on its own quickly enough. She would also give me sleeping pills every time I had any difficulty sleeping (which, as I can tell now, was caused solely by spending too much time in front of the screen before bed and oversleeping in the morning), to the point that a few times I actually started hallucinating because she'd give me an adult dosage, or even a double dosage.

She freaks out every time I lift something heavier than 4kg because ""It's going to make your uterus fall out.""

When I once had a bout of anxiety so severe that I couldn't swallow a single bite of food for 4 days, she told me I was just imagining things.

She's significantly overweight, doesn't exercise, doesn't take care of her health in any way (but is lucky to be quite healthy, good genes from grandparents).

I actually *taught* her what PubMed is, she had no idea it even existed, but even if she did it would be of little use of her because she doesn't speak English (I'm from a non-English speaking country). When I asked her how she keeps up with the most recent research in order to modify her treatments respectively, she tells me she attends conferences. When I probe further, it turns out those conferences are 5% about medicine research and 95% about pharmaceutical companies advertising their new drugs.

And the worst part is, she's not an exception, at least where I live. I've been to the clinic she works at multiple times. I've never seen a single doctor under 40 with healthy weight. Her best friends are also doctors, we often meet. Here's a legit conversation between them the last time we all met during winter holiday, when at one point the topic turned to the effect of dietary cholesterol on heart disease and the efficacy of statins on blood pressure and cardiovascular health. One of the group, a cardiologist, was claiming that statins are, for the most part, bullshit because not only they have so many side effects, their efficacy is very questionable at best, because high cholesterol doesn't actually cause heart disease on its own, inflammation is usually the underlying cause, and artificially lowering cholesterol levels does nothing for health. All the other doctors, mostly GPs, including my mother, were arguing with him, but in the end he ""won"" because he actually knew his shit and could support his statements. Afterwards:

Doctor nr 2: ""You know, I really feel like I don't understand anything about cholesterol anymore.""

Doctor nr 3: ""Yeah, so are statins really bad, then? But what should we be telling the patients instead?""

Doctor nr 4: ""I don't know, I just keep giving statins because that's the standard procedure.""

Doctor nr 3: ""Yeah, same here. And if you don't give the patients anything, they get angry and complain to the administration, so it's just not worth the hassle trying to argue.""

I was just sitting there and thinking: ""... so these are the people whose hands we put our health into.""

Since I came to the UK to study, I've been to two other GPs  for an autoimmune skin condition that I have, and the experience was equally as preposterous. The first time, I told him that my current medication was thinning my skin so I wanted something else. He told me that I would have to wait six months to see a dermatologist (fuck NHS...), but he could write me a prescription for a different, non-corticosteroid medication, I agreed. He wrote the prescription. It turned out to be *exactly the same fucking corticosteroid I've been taking*, except with a slightly different ratio. I changed GPs and went to another one, he finally wrote me a prescription I needed... after googling for several minutes. But the thing is, both times the whole appointment took like 5 minutes. They asked no questions about me or my disease. I could have bought the damn prescription for myself if I was allowed to.

I've never been to a GP since then (for 2 years). Thankfully I'm in great health (aside from that one), and if I really need something, like a NSAID, I can just get it without prescription in a pharmacy or even grocery store. As far as I'm concerned, the only thing GPs are good for is being a link to the actual doctors specialising in something you need at that time; or maybe general things like regular blood tests. But far too often they seem to have no idea what they're doing. This whole system is rotten.",0
341,"If I listened to GP doctors, I'd be dead. 

Every single one of them missed and/or ignored that I had pretty much every textbook symptom of hypothyroidism starting around age 11. 

>You're too young for thyroid issues, you just need to eat less. 

It didn't matter that my mother AND her father had Graves.

It took until I was 25 before I found an endocrinologist who saw my numbers and was basically like ""WTF, why have you not been treated yet?"" 

My thyroid is now essentially fully failed. (For those familiar with dosages, I'm on 200mcg T4, and 10mcg T3 (5mcg twice daily)).

Remaining untreated, I'd be in heart failure for sure and likely dead by now. It's actually surprising there wasn't heart damage from how long I was severely hypo. 

Basically my trust in GP doctors is non-existent. Now they're for yearly physicals and to bully into getting whatever diagnostic test I need done for whatever.    ",0
342,"I don't care for my current one and am looking for a new one. The current one is an alarmist, ordering multiple tests for very insignificant findings, or things that we've already discussed. For example, I have high cholesterol which has a side effect of elevated liver function. When my bloodwork showed all of that, that's exactly what they told me. They also said ""but we're going to test you for hepatitis, just in case."" I told them that I had been vaccinated against hepatitis and had zero other symptoms of hepatitis. They refused to continue any treatment or to write any prescriptions until I took a hep screening. A waste of time and money.

Additionally, their office seems to change RNs every single year, so when I go in for a check up it's someone new every time. And then like clockwork, the new RN sounds the alarm over my cholesterol. I tell them that I've already discussed it with the doctor and their predecessor multiple times, and that unless they have any new info then I won't be coming in for a follow up consultation.

Resistance/weights is generally just 20 pushups in the morning, and another 20 at night (this has been helping, my pushup numbers have been steadily improving).

We've been through a lot together, she was there for me during difficult breakups, and I was there for her when her grandpa passed away. Unconditional honesty has always seemed to be our policy. 

I finally just asked if she would date me, and I told her to take all the time she needed to think it over since it was such a big question. She said, ""I don't have to think it over, I want to do this with you."" 

Sometimes, you just have to risk it for the biscuit, because you don't want to have that regret at the back of your mind, ""what if...?"" Years from now. 

I agree with the comments above, maybe he feels the same way for you too. He's been there for you when you needed someone, and he seems like he's not going anywhere regardless if he has feelings for you that way or not. You guys will make it work the best way it can for your situation :) good luck!",0
436,"I met my husband when we both worked a huge office building in downtown Seattle. We worked in neighboring offices for different companies. We started chatting as everyone had to pass my glass-fronted office to get to the bathroom, and I fell asleep at my desk one day. In the course of a convo, he told me he had to go as he was going to work out with his partner, Matt. Cool, I thought, nice gay guy, maybe we’ll hang out. I get VERY UNCOMFORTABLE around attractive straight men, so I was relieved. We became friends, I met and loved his friends, still thought he was gay. A few months later, his coworker told me, in the course of conversation, that he was not gay. The next week, he told me he liked me, we’ve been together 20 years, married for 18.",0
437,"I had a very similar experience as you with my best guy friend since high school.  We remained friends through out our lives and he would never fail at being there for me even if years had passed since we last spoke. Never fully realizing how important he was... till it snapped for me as well...and it took 20 years! That being said we are about to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary and we've been together for 5 years. Don't be like me...if you think it's a mutual feeling please go for it! I wish I had back in high school, we'd be celebrating 25 years instead!",0
438,"Oh yes! Me and my now boyfriend met through mutual friends and we clicked instantly. I caught feelings quite fast, but he was still going through a phase where he recently got rejected and was still sad about it. So I kept quiet about how I felt. Time passed a bit, we could talk all day and all night and I was madly in love. Fall came around, and after about 6 months of me holding in my feelings, he told me he had feelings for me. That was 4 years ago, and dating my best friend is the best thing that’s ever happened to me.",0
439,"You could say that my situation used to be just like that of your friend. I met a girl around six years ago, and we swiftly became very close friends. I was there for her whenever she had trouble or emotional breakdowns, trying to comfort her. I realized I had feelings for her around one year and a half after we became friends, but I hid those feelings because she already had a boyfriend. Half a year later they broke up, but I still kept my feelings for myself because I didn't want to confess right after she broke up, and I was also very scared. Another year passed, and I was finally able to speak up and confess my feelings. She friendzoned me, but our relationship as friends reamaind as strong as before. Fast forward to last september. During these three years I still couldn't stop having feelings for her. My friends and family kept telling my I should have gotten over it and think about other people, but I just couldn't. She confessed to me last september without me never thinking that she might have changed her mind before that.",0
440,"We started out as roommates in Uni a little over 2 years ago. Both of us got the wrong impression of each other initially. He thought I was a stuck up bitch, since I was friends with someone that was one. I thought he was socially awkward and couldn't tolerate me for no reason. However, we got to know each other more. I invited him to come home with me for thanksgiving for the week, since he had no where to go (he was an international student). I think that was when I caught some feelings without actually knowing it (or at least accept it). However, I didn't want to act on it since I was in a relationship at the time (but by that point, it was falling apart for other reasons not related to the roommate). I told myself that we'd be better friends. Time passes, and we strengthen our friendship. I eventually broke from that previous relationship because of the emotional abuse and strain in my academics that the ex was causing. Roommate helped me through the emotional stress. Got even closer to that roommate in terms of friendship. One night, he invited me into his room after watching a movie, since there was a party going on in our apartment by our other roommates that we didn't want to be a part of. It got late, and he let me sleep in his bed since neither of us wanted to go out. He initiates things by cuddling me, and then tickling me since he couldn't sleep. We ended up kissing, then having sex. That took me over the edge with him. 

We ended up moving across the country after graduating, since he got a job offer and I wanted to be with him. I agreed to move, since I was able to transfer my job and since I'm studying for med school. We just celebrated a year going strong. I love him more than anything, and can see myself marrying him.",0
441,"I hugged him. It was over for me in an instant, just passed our two year anniversary",0
442,"It was gradual. Once we lived together, we started developing deeper feelings for each other. We never defined the relationship or put any aspect of the relationship into words. It's all based on emotions. All relationships are like this, you can't identify specific instances or events that allows you to level up to the next stage. Life doesn't work like that. Certain things will improve or worsen relationships, but they should be treated as one-offs when considering the health of your relationship. You don't look at individual events, you look at everything.

Say currently you guys aren't on good terms, you can evaluate the situation 2 ways. One is to look at the present and disregard the past. You guys feel in love but the passion dissipated, so it's time to move on. Another way is to look at your entire history. You spent a lot of time together, maybe taking care of your memories and the emotions associated with those memories is more important than your immediate satisfaction in life right now. Or maybe you don't have much of a memory to begin with, which makes it a bit easier when making decisions.",0
443,"I’ll answer for my boyfriend. 
We were fuck buddies for the whole summer. We verbally agreed to be friends with benefits, but under two conditions. We stay friends first and we stay monogamous (we weren’t have sex with a condom at the time I know I know) 

We would mess around like bunnies every other day after a stressful day at school. I really liked him but I never thought a guy like him would like a girl like me other than for my body. (Which I was okay with!). 

Exactly one year ago my brother unexpectedly passed away. I got the phone call while I was with him. He didn’t know what to say but he just held me super tight until my friend came to pick me up. 

Soon after I noticed his behavior changing. He was much sweet. Offering to cook me meals. Cuddling with me longer. Asking me how I was doing. 

And then he asked me to be his girlfriend. I was super shocked. I noticed a change in behavior but I thought he was just being nicer. I unfortunately told him no because I wasn’t ready. We continued messing around and one drunken night he told me he noticed he really liked me because he saw how much pain I was in with the death of my brother and wanted to help me not feel that pain anymore. 

And that was the sweetest fucking thing any guy has ever said to me. 

I was finally ready to commit to a relatnship but by then he moved on and ended our FWB. (I learned that me rejecting him really hurt him) 

We later reconnected over the summer and now awe re fully boyfriend and girlfriend (FINALLY)",0
444,We were at a party drinking and hanging out in the couch talking to each other because we both don't like parties. Next thing we know it's about 4am and we're still hanging out on that same couch talking with each other. We eventually passed out leaning up against one another.,0
445,"I met my now girlfriend of two years in middle school, and knew almost immediately. She didn't have feelings for me then, but we were still great friends all throughout school, and a little past graduation before she decided to give me a try. We passed our two year anniversary in october and currently live together.",0
446,"My ex was my first serious relationship and was one of my best friends years before we started dating. There was always some tension, but we never wanted to have it affect our relationship or friend group. 

After a couple years we were no longer flirty and the sexual tension was non existent. One day, after a friend group event, while walking her to her car she grabs me and kisses me and I feel these butterflies rush into my stomach. It was awesome.

We dated for 3 years and I honestly thought she was the one. Best relationship ever! She helped me grow as a person and feel like I owe her for where I am in life now. 

Unfortunately we broke up earlier this summer and it was for the best. Though we made a great team and loved each other deeply we just weren't clicking. Sex was non-existent and it felt like we treated each other like siblings and not a romantic couple. We both had things we could have done better. Sometimes I wonder if I just didn't try hard enough but I've also realized I just wasn't happy and fell out of love... maybe she did too. The last time we had sex it felt mechanical and I felt nothing emotionally like I had before. That's when I knew we we're done.

Now I'm single and have had time to reflect on the flaws we each had and how the relationship broke down over time. I have somethings I need to work on not just for my next partner, but for my own happiness and personal growth. I've been enjoying being single and focusing on working on myself (gym, hobbies, self reflection, career). We haven't spoken since the break up but I wish her nothing, but happiness and if given the choice to go back in time and give it another go I would.",0
447,"This beautiful, smart, hilarious woman was transferred to my Resturant a long time ago when my then boss quit.
She was an amazing boss, the best I’ve had to date in fact. She was married at the time but not an issue because I was getting out of a terrible relationship (that ex was on tv cause she got pulled over and the police found homemade bombs in the trunk that they blew up on tv).
We worked closely together and became instant buds cause we both have a terrible sense of humor. I was not  anywhere near considering her as more than a friend bc she was married and I am not going to be the one who breaks up a happy marriage.
They divorced a month or two after she came to my store.
Later that winter we started going out for drinks with a group of my friends pretty consistently.
I noticed little changes.
Glances that hung on for an extra moment.
Began noticing when she was physically near.
Our group obviously saw it and on New Year’s Eve we were all supposed to go out and everyone stood us up.

Forced to be alone together and a bit into our cups we had our first of at least a billion kisses.",0
448,"Yes and no. We knew each other since elementary school. By the time we recognized we had feelings for each other, she was battling brain cancer and I had just had open heart surgery. So we made the worst mistake possible and decided not to act on it. She beat it the first time around after a long battle. Then I left the state for university, it came back and this time it was just too aggressive so she decided to go out on her own terms. She got a nitrogen tank, a breathing mask, and went out on her own terms and with dignity. I couldnt handle it at the time and had a job offer from a family friend to come work for his private military company. It was the perfect excuse to turn my emotions off and focus on work. I'd give anything to have her back.

During high school was when we first realized we had feeling for each other. I cant count the number of times shed call me at 3 or 4 in the morning, sobbing. So I'd get up, drive to her place, and hold her while she cried. Despite the massive medical issues we were both battling at the time, these were the best times of our lives. We were each the only ones in our respective lives that had any comprehension of how hard, and terrifying our medical issues were so we were also the only ones that could really comfort each other. I'd give anything to have her back.",0
449,Glad that your persistent feelings paid off. Godspeed!,0
450,"I completely agree with themezz. The best kind of relationship like that is one where you don't realize when the ""status"" switched. It sounds like you're comfortable enough with eachother, you may want to try going out 1 on 1 more, edging towards ""date-like"" things where you can without intentionally changing the relationship.

The risk will always be there though, and it can be scary thinking about what you can lose. But if you both can appreciate each other's presence, that can ease a lot of your worries. And even from the little you said, I'm pretty sure that compassion/care exists.",0
451,"This happened to me. Except way worse, and way more dramatic.

Had a group of friends. There was 5 of us in total. One caught feelings for me and I felt similarly. We dated for a bit. It didn't work out and things turned sour. We tried to end things amicably and go back to being friends but it didn't work out. He largely disconnected from the group. Now there were four.

Following that, I drowned my sorrows and vented my frustrations with another member of the group. He'd recently gone through a sour relationship too so we bonded over that. He caught feelings. I figured hey, why not, I like this guy, and we went for it. Another member of group also liked this guy, and was upset they were passed over, subsequently leaving the group. Now there were three. Said relationship eventually went sour. We fell out of touch. Now there were two.

I remained friends with this other guy for a while after the fact. Things always remained purely platonic between us and he was the embodiment of logic and reason. Things seemed pretty safe. It was several years after the aforementioned events and I had recently gotten back together with the second guy, only for things to fall apart again and for us to fall out of touch. Shortly after, the last remaining guy expressed interest. Clearly being an idiot and not having learned from all of this, I went for it. Things fell apart shortly after.

And now, there is no friends group.

I'm ashamed of how long it took me to learn that lesson and that I lost far too many friends over it. If I could turn back time, I'd have kept them as friends and nothing more. While each of them came onto me and not the other way around, I should have had the willpower and foresight to turn them down, to know how things would go. I miss having them as friends, but I know the damage is done - I don't wish to reopen old wounds by trying to contact them. Also, I highly doubt my current partner would approve of me contacting exes, and fair enough too - I'd feel the same way.",0

453,My buddy got drunk and passed out. Woke up to some chick giving him a blow job. He was totally grossed out and got really pissed. I submit that there are some times when a man might object.,0
454,"Use mouth and hand in same direction. It feels ver good when you are deep inside her mouth so ""on the down stroke"" get your hand out of the way to get him deep in there. On the upstroke, maybe take him out of your mouth completely, do a screwing motion on the wet glans with your hand, before taking him in your mouth again and doing another downstroke. Great stuff.

Alternatively, if your hand is very tired: Just grab the very base of his shaft an pull down to ""pull the foreskin tight"" makes the whole thing a bit more sensitive. Do normal blowjob thing with your mouth.

Similar thing: You know those plastic or metal rings a man can put around his balls? Use your thumb and index finger to simulate one of those. Stops the balls from wandering upward and delays orgasm, makes the orgasm more intense when it finally does arrive.

For some men: Give his asshole some attention, it's a bit taboo, but feels great.",0
455,"Rub my legs, back or butt.

Also learn to do the tongue trick. It's where you swirl your tongue around the head every time you pull back. Also be sloppy. Drool on it. Spit on it. Nobody likes a neat blowjob. Eye contact is also huge.

Also, ask the dude to jerk off for you so you can see exactly how they like to be touched. I do the same for girls because not all clitorises are the same. Some you can't even touch directly, and some need to take a goddamn cheese grater to it to feel anything.

Same with guys. Some like pure stimulation to the head, some like long strokes. Some like a gentle tug, some want a gorilla handjob.

456,"I have to say not everyone is all about the balls. I for one could care less if you touch them during oral. My experience is that if a girl can't go too deep with her mouth, using her hands around the shaft while she goes up and down feels great. But the BEST to me is when she uses on hand to stroke upwards (one motion), then alternates the other hand so one hand is always stroking upward but they keep alternating. Keep doing this while you're sucking on the tip",0

468,"25 M, been doing this for years.  The [Healthy Strokes](http://www.healthystrokes.com/TMS.pdf) thing linked elsewhere is interesting, but I'm not sure how accurate.  To me it seems a little judgemental, i.e. ""90% of guys do it the standard way so anything else is weird"" kinda thing.

One caveat - I do occasionally vary me auto-erotic M.O., and do it in what I guess is a conventional manner.  But, 90+% of the time, I do it prone.

I have sex fairly often, sometimes several times a week.  I've never had much problem with maintaining an erection (sometimes I do if wearing a condom, but with my girlfriend on BC I don't have to worry about that.)  

Sometimes it takes me a long time to finish, and every once in a blue moon I can't finish.  However, sometimes I finish in an embarrassingly short amount of time.  The vast majority of times I finish in a normal (I guess?) amount of time, usually with my girlfriend climaxing just a bit before, or sometimes I finish her off with my hand after.

The one thing that did (sort of) strike a chord with me is not coming from oral.  I never have.  However, I've never had oral performed on me for very long, i.e. just as foreplay and never as just the main event.  I'm actually not a big fan of it as foreplay as I'll come quicker after.  If it were the main event I think I could come from it.

Now that it's been brought up, I am interested if I need to make the switch.  I don't find the Healthy Strokes thing that convincing.  Does anyone have any info on prOnanism causing any lasting and irreversible damage?",0

Humping-style masturbation does use a lot more pressure than masturbating with your hands.

Be vocal. If you're opening your mouth to breathe and are really relaxed, you might find yourself being vocal than usual. Let it happen. Your voice resonates in your stomach, your chest, and your head. For your partner it gives them feedback, encouragement, and adds another sexy dimension to the lovemaking. For yourself, it makes the activities more visceral internally and helps make the session a whole body experience, Don't stifle your moans. 

Talk dirty. You don't have to voiceover the entire time, but when things get intense every now and then, engage and challenge your partner (or yourself) by narrating or questioning what's going on, e.g., ""You like when I got slow and deep, don't you?"" or ""Fuck yeah, stroke that cock."" or ""Fuck, that feels good.""

Explore. If you make sex about focusing on one area of your partner's body or your own, you're cheating both of you out of a tremendous amount of stimulation and experience. There are ares like chest, lips, genitals, and hips that most consider erogenous zones, but once you get someone going, pretty much any part of someone's body can make them tremble; neck, back, top of head, ears, arms, fingers, thighs, feet, Touch, stroke, squeeze, and grasp them all over. Touch, stroke, squeeze, and grasp ***yourself*** all over. 

Be self aware, mindful, attentive, creative, and communicative. If you're with a partner communicate and encourage communication from them.

There's this illustration of the stages of arousal called the Sexual Response Cycle. Starting with no arousal, you go to Excitement (teasing, foreplay, ramping up, etc.) to Plateau (the thick of the act where everything just feels amazing) to Orgasm (climax) to Resolution (all the tension washes away and refractory period can set it). Good orgasms feel great, but too many people focus solely on them. The Plateau stage is where you want to focus. Make the sex itself amazing and dynamic and elevating and the Orgasm will be that much better. With or without a partner, don't rush what could be a great meal just because you want the dessert. Have fun and be creative.",0

500,"I still don't have a freaking clue on how did I managed to get this girl to like me, let alone start a relationship and actually fuck me. Easily the best kisses I've had in my life, and the best sex by far.

EDIT: My 'bloom' was at 22 years old, she had 28 and my od I still remember her passion ten years later",0
501,"I've responded on here earlier, but this is more detailed. Failure did it for me. 

I'm about to turn 32 in July. Before 2017, I only dated one person in my lifetime and it was for 2 1/2 years. She and I have done sexual things, but we never had intercourse. She had been afraid, and then I became afraid. Lo-and-behold, she broke it off on Christmas Eve 2013.

2017 rolls around, and I began breaking out of my shell, making friends and building a foundation for my life. I convinced myself, somehow, that a relationship was the missing ingredient. Perhaps it was being the butt-end of my friends jokes for ""sexual inexperience"" and ""undersexed"" ... usually these jokes were passed by women friends ... regardless, I had become insecure. I didn't know the extent of my insecurity, but it motivated me to resolve the problem. So, I entered the world of online dating.

I went on 30-something first dates, and none of them ""worked"" and went beyond a 1st date. I didn't know what I had been doing wrong, and I felt they all saw something that I lacked any access to. As failure after failure began occurring, I became bitter and resentful. ""They see something wrong in me,"" you see, ""and I have no idea what it is, but I have this omnipresent feeling of being unlovable."" Indeed, I began expressing to friends that I felt unlovable. 

So, a long time crush of mine enters the picture (and I mean long-time crush). And she agreed to hang out with me and my friends group, but only as friends ... she insisted that she only wanted to be friends. I agreed. She came over. We drank and flirted the entire time. Touching, caressing, hand holding, you name it ... lots of cuddling and physical affection for someone that only desired friendship. So later on, I kissed her. She didn't like it. The last thing I wanted her to feel was threatened, and she was entirely valid in having that concern at this point-in-time. I didn't press any further that night.

I apologized to her soon after this night, and she agreed to hang out with me alone a second night, not two weekends later. I should never have had her over. I never realized just how bad inexperience can shape us out to be. Conversation was good. There was more cuddling. During the wee hours of the morning, 1 AM or so, she brought up sex. She asked me when the last time I had sex was. I said it had a long time ... it was about 3 years since my first ex came over for a ""hook up"" but without intercourse. I remember the look on her face. I kid you not, it looked like contempt. Of course, I may have been projecting that. But I felt something I never felt before ... I froze. I had never frozen up before. She got up from the couch, made it about me (showing her own insecurities, which I overlooked at the time), and quickly paced to the bathroom.

I felt like a shit-ton of bricks hit me. It was a simple rejection, but I had access to something I never had access to. I understood why I was unlovable. It took me many months to understand, but I had an emotional flashback to my stepmom dropping me off at a daycare when I was 5. I never saw nor heard from her again. I never healed from such an experience, and I carried this experience into adulthood. 

Abandonment. My experience had been unlocked. I had been emotionally attuned to my experience as a child. I blamed myself for the experience ever since.

I've been carrying this experience since mid-2017. I've dated two women after this experience, both of whom I've had sex with. I've determined I'm more comfortable not being emotionally open with partners. Sex is not tied to intimacy for me, and I felt neither of them loved me for who I am. 

This was a very painful journey, but I highly recommend anyone undertake it. Why? There's a flip-side to all this.

I learned how to express myself through writing. I became aware of my limitations. And I learned that I had bigger issues than a lack of a relationship. I'm grateful for the entire arrangement, because it pushed me into a spot that I'm not comfortable being within. And it allowed me to discover areas of my life that needed healing and self-parenting, parenting that had been lacking since I had been young.",0

504,"You are right. You can do everything right and still fail. But the chances of it working out are increased by taking an active role. You have taken an active role by seeing a psychologist. It doesn't mean you're cured but it means that you're at least closer toward overcoming your obstacle rather than willingly dwelling in it.

I also believe mindset plays a large role. I'm bipolar and depression and mania are something I have to live with. I don't let it control me because it is something I'm fighting, it's not something that defines me. I've lived an incredible life even though I'm depressed as shit for the majority and have experienced more failure than success. Hell I'm a late bloomer as well and have been rejected way too many times that i've lost count. But I'd rather be doing something than doing nothing. I can see the rejection as proof that I'm a piece of shit that nobody is ever going to love or care about, or I can see it as proof that the person rejecting me isn't the right person for me. That I deserve to find someone who cares about me and wants to be with me regardless of my issues. I can increase the chances of me finding it by taking a more active role. I can put myself out there, work on my issues, and keep trying. If my success rate is 1/1000. Then my odds are better by talking to 1000 girls than only 2 or 3 in my life. 

I've experienced one of the harshest rejections in my life by the person I cared for most in the world. I finally got my shit together and did everything right. Spent years working on myself and becoming the person I wanted to be. She was the first person I was sure about and was willing to be vulnerable with and I knew her for over half my life. She was the person who knew me best in the world and she said she loved me and needed me in her life. Then she ghosted me the next day. A month later she's with a friend of mine. It sucked and for a while I was broken. I had a choice wallow in self-pity or do something with my life. I chose to do something. I didn't want to undo all the years of progress I made. So I did something about it. 

Created a company with my best friends doing what we love, kept myself in check throughout it, and now I'm honestly happy for once. I started working out, caring about my image and bought nicer clothes, better haircuts, generated income for myself, and my confidence in myself went up. Actually I stopped giving a fuck before I even had confidence. The worst had happened and I survived so why not try. I got rejected more, and by more I mean a lot. Now I get dates at a higher rate than before and not all of them are going to work out and that's okay. I'm better now and will be okay. The company hasn't panned out yet. I'm not even sure if it'll succeed but it makes me happy, keeps me busy, and has been a crazy journey that shows that I'm at least no longer passive about my life. I'm grateful for the opportunity to fail and succeed.

I've failed more than I've succeeded but all it takes is for one to work out. So why not keep trying and increasing the odds of meeting that one.",0
505,"Diesel fuel is longer burning and more highly combustible, which means the engines are just made differently to utilize the diesel. They are bigger, and the piston rods are placed different and have more leverage. Regular petrol is ignited and burns instantly, but Diesel engines combust solely from heat and a compression point, and the fuel burns longer, which I believe is the main reason why they create more torque, which allows for longer strokes at low RPM.

One way to look at it, is a petrol car will reach its max torque firing rapidly, because the petrol ignites so fast, the engine is rapidly working and igniting that quick burst a lot faster.

The Diesel engine will reach its max torque slowly, it’s a long stroke and the fuel has more powerful combustion’s and burns longer, usually the whole time, so it doesn’t have to work rapidly to get that power.",0
506,"As the others have said, diesel fuel contains more energy than gasoline but is actually less combustible than gas. That is to say, it takes much longer exposure to higher temperatures to ignite diesel than it does gas. This high flashpoint has advantages, though. Because it's slow-burning, the air/fuel mixture will burn much longer which allows for a longer stroke and a longer stroke means more torque. The reason most big-bore diesel engines are inline 6s is balance. I6 engines are as close as you can get to perfectly balanced and you need that when you're designing an engine that operates on a principle that's naturally extremely violent and causes a lot of vibration. That said, there are diesel engines in every configuration that gas engines come in and even some that are unique to diesel like the Commer Knocker. It just happens that when it comes to commercial truck engines, I6s are the best balance of power, torque, fuel economy, and packaging. If you look back a couple-few decades, you'll find trucks that had everything from massive gas V8s to supercharged, 2-stroke diesel V12s (and they sound orgasmic). The concept of every new truck ever having a 12-16-liter, 4-stroke I6 is actually fairly recent.",0
507,"Wow, there is so much wrong in this thread.

First thing you have to realize is diesel engines and gas engines are nothing alike. Diesel engines operate at wide open throttle all the time and load control is done by fuel e.g. more fuel more power less fuel less power. Fuel is ignited by compressing air with the piston to a point it's so hot when fuel is added in it spontaneously combusts. Note the order here, air is compressed and then fuel is added. More over how fuel combusts in this process is constant pressure meaning the attempt is to have it burn for as long as possible during the expansion stroke. 

 Gasoline engines (Otto cycle) operate by trying to mix the exact correct amounts of fuel and air to just make CO2 and water, using air as the method of load control. Fuel and air is compressed and a spark ignites the mixture. The desire here is to have everything burn immediately at top dead center by igniting the mixture and having it all go up at once. 

Now Otto cycle engines/gasoline engines are more efficient than diesel engines at the same compression ratio (by a large margin too). Unfortunately remember the part where I said the air in a diesel engine is compressed then fuel is added to combust, well turns out if you try to compress fuel and air mixture too much it combusts prematurely (this is called knock btw), therefore diesels can achieve much higher compression ratios and therefore much higher fuel efficiency.

Ok so part one down diesels are always more fuel efficient than gasoline in reality (until some exotic cycles start coming out).

Part 2: Torque and engine rpm. Displacement has nothing to do with power, period, if someone tells you otherwise slap them. The main limiting factor in power generation of an engine is intake port size. Only thing displacement gets you is to peak power faster. Engine torque is directly related to how much you can pull, diesels generally make up their high compression ratios by a longer stroke and higher displacement therefore more torque. But remember displacement is how fast an engine makes peak power, therefore we can also assume diesels make peak power at low RPM, and they do. Generally somewhere to the tune of 1200-3000 RPM depending on the application. Which is great for pulling since you don't have to ring the engines neck to power and makes pulling alot more simple. 

Also remember all power is, is torque and RPM. Low speed means all the power is from torque. Torque is good for pulling so great. 

So long store short, diesels are more efficient, and make peak power down low and have high torque and low speed. That's why they're used for pulling things. 

Regarding I6s, someone else made a comment for engine balancing that's a good one. More simply because of the stroke and displacement most of the time configuration is based on what they can actually fit in the space. There's so much to consider with engine configuration it's not even worth getting into.",0
508,"Yeah no. You can go to the YouTube channel warpedperception. He has a gasoline engine with a see through cylinder head. Gasoline engines burn from a point, the sparkplug, and have a travelling flamefront. They burn through the entire powerstroke.

A diesel engine only starts injecting fuel into the cylinder when the fuel is supposed to start burning. Which means that all the fuel ignites immediately and burns at top dead center of the powerstroke

The sooner all the fuel is burnt the more power you get out of the fuel and the more efficient your engine is. Because piston engines work on a pressure differential. 

When all the fuel burns at the start of the stroke the pressure inside the cylinder is higher for longer, because the gas can't get out of the cylinder until you open the exhaust valve, meaning the area under the curve is higher than if you were to burn fuel throughout the whole stroke.

Now for power. A gasoline engine and a diesel engine might have the same torque. But the gasoline engine has the torque at 5000rpm and the diesel at a much more economical, more efficient, 2000rpm.",0
509,"Torwue depends solely on how long your stroke is and how much displacement the engine has.

Lots of stroke means lots of torque at the low end of the RPM range but the engine doesn't rev fast or high.

Lots of bore and very little stroke means the engine has fuck all torque but revs really high which gives you lots of power.",0
510,"You don't want the fuel to burn through the entire stroke. You want it to all burn at TDC. Because if it all burns at TDC you get a higher pressure which means more area under the curve and therefore more power and efficiency.

If you go to the YouTube channel warpedperception you can see a gasoline engine with a see through cylinder head. The gas engine burns through the entire stroke because it starts burning a A/F mixture from a single point. A diesel engine only contains air until it starts injecting fuel right when the fuel is supposed to start burning. This means that in a diesel all the fuel burns immediately and way faster than in a gasoline engine.

There's also nothing stopping you from building a gasoline engine with a really small bore and a huge stroke. It just won't rev very high.",0
511,"[Bullshit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Cutaway_of_a_MAN_V8_Diesel_engine.jpg). The thing between the valves is the diesel injector. And that's a MAN V8 diesel engine.

Every modern diesel engine has [common rail injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_rail) (Every diesel engine that has ever existed was injected. Either directly into the cylinder or into a prechamber.) That's why it needs a high pressure fuel pump. Because it injects the diesel right when it wants it to start burning and because diesel needs to be very finely atomized, a state which it really, really doesn't like being in, which is also why carbureted diesel engines aren't and have never been a thing. And the higher the pressure the smaller you can make the hole in the injector whilst still flowing the same amount of fuel but getting way better atomization and therefore a cleaner and faster burn.

 It injects the fuel  at 1'500-36'000psi (100-2500 bar) by the way.

Oh and if the fuel was in the cylinder during the compression stroke it wouldn't start burning at TDC. It would start burning about halfway up which would kill your engine very very quickly.",0

If you say so. Here's the thing, if I'm gonna catch a fish, I'm not gonna ask the fish what the best way to do it is, I'm gonna ask a fisherman. Stroking a girl's ego is a surefire way of getting rejected for coming across as desperate unless you already have a solid foundation of attraction.

We'd been expecting it for a long time, he was in poor health most of my life and had a stroke a few months ago. I wasn't ready to lose him, but I knew it could happen pretty much at any time, and he was suffering immensely. It was a stressful weight to carry for the whole family. In some ways I had been grieving before he actually died, especially during close calls. Little heart attacks and strokes happened from time to time.

I haven't really dealt with it yet. Not fully anyway, maybe not for years.

I will say that he went during a healthy point in our relationship. There was no unresolved tension, I was living with them and helping them at the time. He went peacefully too. He was a hard man to love, but I let go of my grudges when I saw his body and tried to find his pulse and breathing. Love is more powerful than resentment, and he was out of suffering. For all of that, I am grateful, despite the pain of losing him.

I did some funeral rights the night he died, I anointed him with oil and ashes and smudged the air, left him with coins and my key. Later, I went to a holy place in the mountains and prayed, left a tabacco offering. I know in my heart that he's at peace.

It's hard that I can't touch him, or share stories anymore. It's hard that I can't call him and tell a joke, or show him antlers or rocks I've found. I can't ask him for advice. But, I know that the best parts of him are the best parts of me, and that he isn't suffering anymore.

For me (and probably your friend too) things like kissing, cuddles and gentle strokes are like natural, integral parts of sexual intercourse. It would feel awkward to just fuck a girl like an animal

541,"Your feelings are *always* valid. Whether or not the immediate trigger concern is the issue or it's something else is just a matter of constructively critical examination.  Emotional logic uses experience and association, working through chemicals and electricity instead of language, but it does have logic to the process. It's not always clear, sometimes it takes shortcuts, sometimes it creates grooves that are hard to escape, sometimes the connection between causes, effects, and correlations aren't obvious... but that's just a matter of practice.

And yes, sometimes the chemicals go a little haywire on their own, for no external reason. Mental health issues suck and being made of meat sucks, but that's a slightly different topic. Sometimes no good answer is apparent after careful examination, but usually that just means you can't see it from your perspective yet. It could be a collection of smaller things that piled up (like a lack of water, food, or vitamin D). Sometimes it *is* nothing at all, but... usually not.

You've every right to have complex feelings and views on a topic. That's normal. You have every right to be upset, as long as you understand why you're upset.  Ideally, you can communicate those feelings accurately and are can respond proportionally\*.\*  Passion does not invalidate your reasoning, but it may require more succinct language.

Let's take a look at idea of ""red flags"" and compare it to the technical term ""[thin slicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-slicing).""  Your subconscious recognized a pattern (I'm guessing this incident is similar to past trauma), sends you a ""gut feeling"" alarm, which translates into anxiety, sadness, depression, etc., and encourages action of some kind (adrenaline response, ""fight flight or freeze"", repeating previous trauma feelz, whatever).  You've recognized the problems at that level, and the conscious part of your brain is attempting to make sense of those alarm bells, but they're loud and fussy and make it hard to think.

**That is normal. Your response is absolutely normal.**

*What you do about that* is the more important question.  What do you want to do? What do you need *to see* to feel safe and have your needs met? Can you get those things from \[This Guy\]? Can you talk to him about it? If you cannot communicate your needs or have them met in a satisfactory manner, well... your time together is over. That sucks. Mourn the loss of what it should have been, but do not *lower* yourself for someone who won't show you the same respect or effort.  Don't chase.

You deserve kindness, trust, love, safety, stability and respect. Everyone does. You deserve those from yourself to yourself, and you deserve those from whomever you're spending time with, regardless of the label on that relationship or the goals you share.

That can be really fucking hard, especially when you're dealing with past traumas, but it's a learned skill just like everything else.

You can do it.

Consider this article about [Tolerance vs Reciprocity](https://aeon.co/essays/reciprocity-not-tolerance-is-the-basis-of-healthy-societies).  TLDR: tolerance isn't enough. That *reciprocity* is now your standard for relationships, because *everyone does* and you are not exempt.",0

556,"Currently trying to build an electronically driven fuel injection for a 2 stroke engine. 
Its really hard, so I already gave up on direct injection and variable valve timing.
",0
557,"Yes this is correct, they absolutely do. The key is that they dont release a fixed amount of fuel, and they do it at différent time depending on the amount of fuel the release. They also do it a bit sooner or a bit later. They also control the ignition timing, which can also happen in advance or later. 

Am doing it on a 2 stroke because I dont have a small 4 stroke available to dabble on, but the basics are the same.

For example, if you are idling and the engine is cold, you ignite a bit in advance from the cycle, because it will take a relatively long time to ignite.
If you open full throtlle, the amount of fuel you want to release is greater, but also depends at which speed the engine is rotating. 
If you are moving fast, the relative wind will input a lot of air in the engine, so you can input more fuel to burn with it.
If the engine is rotating very fast, the air/fuel will be very agitated, very well mixed, so you ignite a bit later, because it will burn very fast. 
The injector itself inputs fuel at a fixed rate, so if you want to input more, you need to start earlier.

All in all, what I described is a multidimentionnal (heat, throttle, air flow, rpm, Lambda sensor) engine cartography. A carburetor does basically the same thing, but mecanically and only bi dimensionnaly, (throttle and rpm)

As for why .. well, because I thought it was really cool, also engines are interesting and wanted to learn all I could about them, but mainly because its the main key to every advanced ""electronic feature"" that engine dealer provide (traction control, etc) without providing any information or control to whoever they sell it. So if you buy a car, an rc plane, a grass cutter, (pretty much any fuel engine in fact), they dont grant customer full control over it, and your mechanic/repairman cant do much more than change the whole damn thing.
So if there was a free project, anyone could strip the ECU box from their cars/bike/stuff and put their own as a replacement for the original one that cost a fortune and does not let you tune your engine they way you want (yes some hacked firmware exist, but they barely scratch the surface of what can be done)

Consent is vitally important, and I'm glad you realize that men need to consent to sex just as much as women do. And yeah, early on in a relationship that is going to need to be made explicit -- and that's easy to do with very little effort. You don't need to phrase it like a legal contract, contrary to what some people seem to think. With time, people can get more familiar with each other and understand their body language and how they act when they are and aren't interested, and it becomes more possible to be confident that you have consent without laying it out verbally -- but if you aren't *completely* confident that you know someone well enough to recognize that, then you need to ask.

Not at all. If I’m in a relationship with you, I obviously trust you with my body. I’ll say “no” if I don’t want something you’re doing, and so long as you don’t physically hurt me or cause me pain, it’s all good to touch me.

600,"OP, you and your girlfriend fought that often? It sounds to me that it was for both your and her benefit this ended. Having been there, here a some things to keep in mind. 

1) being single is better than being in a bad relationship. 

2) every relationship you’re going to be in is going to fail until one doesn’t. If your goal is to get married, the vast majority of your relationships are going to fail simply because you only end up with one person. Most of your relationships will fail, unless...  

3) change the parameters for what counts as a successful relationship. So, let’s say you’re in a relationship you know is going to end (one of you is moving, one of you is starting school and about to be super busy, you can just tell this won’t last, any number of reasons), the question is, why continue with it knowing it’ll end. Because you’re getting better at dating. You’ll be better able to communicate with future partners. You’ll be better able to please and give your future partners the sort of support and help they might need. You’ll be better able to identify what if you want, and you’ll be better at asking your future partner for that, or you’ll realize your future partner isn’t giving you what you need that much sooner. Enjoying the moment together is enough to say you had a successful relationship. Who cares it ended? You enjoyed your time with her and you grew as a person. That’s what a successful relationship should be defined by. And finally...

4) if you’re stuck in an okay relationship, that means there’s a great potential relationship you’re not in. Why be okay with a passable relationship knowing, somewhere out there, is the girl of your dreams. And you’re the man of her dreams. You two would be perfect together! But it’s too bad you’re stuck in this okay, sometimes we fight, sometimes we don’t, relationship. Go find the great one!",0

I might get cozy with a girl at times, but its more about being with the girl than the touch as even then it can be annoying having someone else in your space. As for your conclusions about sexual it resulting in increased sexual desires i would disagree. I think if a man is lacking physical touch then they are less likely to be ""using"" women for sex, and more so perusing intimacy. The reason why men peruse sex more is not so much a societal flaw but genetic design. Men have an almost endless supply of semen, and biologically are looking to procreate as much as posiible and spread their seed, hence a higher sex drive. Women however have a limited supply of eggs, and when they do reproduce they have 9 months of investment. Because of this they need to be more selective about their partners and thus weren't programmed with the same level of sexual thirst.

616,"I OD'd on painkillers, woke up in the hospital a few days later. Spent the next few weeks in a neurological ward, then graduated to the psych ward after that. Spent the next two months there playing pool, watching TV, reading, going to daily counselling sessions, trying to avoid some other nut jobs in there and getting 3 square meals a day. Got weekend leave for a few hours to see my cat. And my mum would come in every couple days to talk. 

I needed to be in there and eventually came out with anti depressants/psychotic prescriptions. I took those for a few months and didn't like how they made my legs shake and took away my sex drive.

I quit the meds after 4 months and started walking everyday which lead to swimming and getting into the gym. Exercise and personal achievement/progression is a helluva drug.

I still have down days, but I'm back in to life, getting fitter, smarter and learning not to compare myself to others. Everyone is running their own race in this life so it helps to just stay focused on what you want and not what others have.

Stay disciplined, learn to be mindful of your thoughts, Count to ten when you start to feel bad. Think of yourself as a mountain and your thoughts and feelings as clouds that pass you by. 

Think of 10 things you're grateful for each morning. Exercise each day even if it's just air squats and pull ups on your door frame. Stop checking social media so much, eat healthy, Be honest with yourself.

TL:dr Educate yourself, stay disciplined, exercise everyday, these things have helped me alot after leaving the psych ward. (it sucks in there)",0

Some of them just completely lose interest.  I have a friend who is in his 50's whose wife told him she wouldn't be having sex with him because she's not interested in it anymore.  So now he's stuck in a sexless marriage.  Even my OB/GYN said it is common for that to happen to women.  

The thought of that happening to me scares me to death, to be perfectly honest.  I cannot imagine a day where my sex drive is zero.  If that ever happens, I'm giving my husband a pass to get sex from someone else.

And then i started with some music lessons, and as months passed by i just realized that my life will be better if i just played my guitar for living, wouldn't be awesome if i could just play my instrument all the time? The dream was huge and i had to work so hard to make it. My guitar teacher was a huge example, and he supported me even when my mom was just not sure for my future. 
And then i started to really think of it, and one day i made my decision. Still many people told me, that i was throwing my life away, that all musicians die starving and that i had no talent. Still i just stayed clear in my desicion and of course i had fear, but when you love something you just work it out, and the universe somehow makes it possible too. I'm now in my first year to be a classic guitarist, been fighting for my dream since late 2010, still i have to make a massive amount of work, but i know that i'm in the right place, there's nothing in life like living making the thing you love. Being a musician has changed my fucking life. My depression is still present but i know i'm working on it, and my shyness and my introversion are falling down whith each presentation i do. How do i know that i'm in the right place? when i look back to the time when i was in my other career, and i just know that i never want to go there again. Fuck system engineering seriously. I'm a proud man now, because i know that in spite all the things people told me, i'm working my dream out.

The throat thing *might* be indigestion or acid reflux.  You can confirm this by taking Alka Selzter or Zantac.  Shortness of breath can also be related.  Talk to a GI about that, and they can help.  Google for other symptoms.

This may also be exercise induced asthma.  It could also be allergy related.  I would suggest you talk to an allergist as they can check your lungs for asthma and allergy stuff.

Do you ever feel cold all over?  Shortness of breath at the same time?  I used to get that when I had anxiety attacks (from nearly dying from a blood clot in my lungs).  If the coldness goes away as you fall asleep then it may be anxiety.  I got over that after a year of therapy.",0

It was doing well for a couple of years but failed. Became an employee for 4 more years before trying again. Now my new company is about 3 years and despite many hardships, it is doing relatively well. 

HOWEVER, my personal life is completely non-existent. I've broken up with my girlfriend over 7 years just before considering getting married. Dating is impossible for me now. All my friends are getting happy marriages/relationships showing off their newborns or happy time together as their family on my facebook feed. While all i do is work daily, not that i'm complaining about my work, but rather i'm complaining about the lack of non-work stuff.

You haven't failed, maybe you consider your career as a failure, but as a family man, as a father (I assume you have children), believe me, YOU. HAVE. NOT. FAILED. You have just prioritized your family over work and that is a choice you should be proud of.

For me, even if my career is great, we no one to share it with, it is quite lonely. Unbearable at times, really. Not sure if it was worth it if anything. Alot of people, including me, are quite jealous of your status. So, please, cherish it.",0

I have furthered my education so I can move into an adjacent area, and hope that will help, but where I am now does affect my confidence negatively.

Not everyone hits the same steps in life in the same order. Many of those younger people could have had businesses but they aren’t going to tell you their first three start-ups went under or that they are lonely cause they passed on the wife/family card.  Someone else doing well doesn’t mean what you have accomplished is somehow worth less, I’m sure the age thing can be uncomfortable but if anything encourage him if he’s not a Douchebag. If he is actually good at what he does, tell him you admire what he’s been able to do and how quickly he could do it.  You might find out that things aren’t always what they seem...and if it is, he probably will admire you for being able to acknowledge his accomplishments because usually the work dynamic is younger bosses butting heads with older people.",0

Now a yacht will make you happy? And so on. Is it the approval/admiration of your peers? That is fickle anyway, most don't even care about you. And they will not start caring because you're ""successful"" except for their own gains.

So is having a ""winner"" career really winning? Or is it just a misdirection for 99% of the population?

You say, you have no friends because you have a caustic personality. I don't know what that means, but have you tried changing yourself? Your personality is not set in stone, you can have whatever personality you want to have.

What does ""failure at life in general"" even mean? As far as I know, there is no win condition in life. Biological life's only goal is to not die and pass on your genes, which you've done perfectly so far. So in that sense, you're an absolute success. You only feel like a failure because you believe in some made-up definition of ""success"". Just because most people think that having lots of money is ""winning at life"", doesn't make it true. At one point, most people believed owning many slaves was winning at life. Was it right because most people thought that?

What I'm trying to tell you is: you can't be a failure at life. Life is life and you won already no matter which way you live it. Now you just have to figure out how to live it happily, right now. What can you do right now that makes you happy? And not instant-gratification happy, like coke& bitches. What have you always wanted to do but haven't because you were so focused on your career? Spend more time with your daughter? Hang out with friends (I know what you said, you'd have to find new ones, which is possible)? Build a table? Do it now.

Broken heart syndrome is a temporary heart condition that's often brought on by stressful situations, such as the death of a loved one. The condition can also be triggered by a serious physical illness or surgery. People with broken heart syndrome may have sudden chest pain or think they're having a heart attack.
In broken heart syndrome, there's a temporary disruption of your heart's normal pumping function in one area of the heart. The remainder of the heart functions normally or with even more forceful contractions. Broken heart syndrome may be caused by the heart's reaction to a surge of stress hormones.

The condition may also be called takotsubo cardiomyopathy, apical ballooning syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy by doctors. The symptoms of broken heart syndrome are treatable, and the condition usually reverses itself in days or weeks.

Im in my early 20’s, I broke up with my last 2 girlfriends, the first one wasn’t nearly as bad as the second. I spent nearly a year of my life with this girl (which may seem short to others, but was the longest I’ve had to record) it was a slow crash, that’s what I remember it feeling like. After months of learning everything about eachother we fell into a routine. Day after day we did the same thing, day after day I felt myself slowly losing interest in her. She was a sweet girl, artistic, didn’t like to argue, she put me on a pedestal. She loved me more than anyone she’d ever been with, but I didn’t, at least not at the time. I got to a point where I just didn’t know what I wanted, I looked at this girl like a jigsaw puzzle, it seemed to me that I had found and put all the pieces together and now it was time for me to let go. So I did. I remember that night so clearly. It was late, she was sitting on the curb crying her eyes out while I watched her a trickle of guilt sprang in my mental pipework. Soon that trickle grew into something else entirely over the passing days, weeks, and months... all the way to now. It’s been long over a year and I see myself in the mirror every afternoon evening or night... depending on how late I sleep missing her.. maybe not her specifically but I’m missing that connection that I had with her. 

To this day I half heartedly swipe around tinder, looking for someone who will give me any amount of attention but I have yet to find a single soul that can even compare to my old love.

654,"When I was younger, I never really had the framework to deal with heartache/heart break. It took a lot of different relationships, with a lot of different people before I found how to cope effectively. I dont consider myself an expert, but my recovery time is mitigated significantly from what it would have been 15 years ago. 

If I had the oportunity to help my younger self, this is what I would say:

**The pain you are feeling is from a lack of understanding of your current emotional state. You need to be patient and explore your feelings. Look for the root of where they are coming from. You are a good person, and you have noble goals. Instead of changing yourself for others benefit, consider embracing your passions. Worry less about what others think about you and more about who you are. Establish a person that can exsist outside of a relationship instead of being a person reliant on one.**",0

I look at my peers who have already finished school and think, ""I can't bask in this yet, I'm not even close to the person I want to be."" I recognize this as potentially unhealthy, but I'm afraid to let go of this discontentment (almost a self-loathing, but I suppose channeled in a way the brings about positive change). I'm certain it's what's helped me get this far.",0

664,"Ahh, as in, you disapprove of their lifestyle choices. So when they imply that your disapproval is related to a fear of them, that they are taking a ""cop-out"", rather than to acknowledge that you disagree with that person at a fundamental level. 

It's really all about motivations. Anti and Pro LGBTQ tend to attack dissenters. For instance, the LGBTQ attack on drag queens/cross-dressing men, exclusionary attitudes, and even banning from public events. They call them damaging to their cause, etc. Odd, considering the gender constructs that they ask others to respect. 

LGBTQ folks are largely focused on the societal construct of Gender. They modify the gender construct, since sex is largely binary, outside of birth defects and chromosomal disorders.

They (LGBTQ) have been attacked since people were aware they existed. So they are hyperaware on the matter. I mean, if I were attacked constantly, I would also be on my toes. I don't think we all need to approve of each other's lives in order to get along. 

Many LGBGTQ hate religious people with a passion, yet demand acceptance from those people. 
Many religious folks attack LGBTQ and are hateful to them, yet demand that those people accept them as practitioners of that faith. 

The World is not filled with brightest people. For instance, people who absolutely hate the entire demographic, without ever acknowledging that there individuals, and that you should care for your neighbor's well being, regardless of your view on their lifestyle choices.

It's not always going to work out easily. Just be good to one another. I was originally afraid of associating with homosexuals, because of the Army, and as well, the challenge to my sexuality, and identity. I no longer have this trouble, but I still find some of the behaviors, that I have observed to be irrational, and irritating. Speaking with a pronounced lisp, people whose identities seem to be based solely on the fact that they are a homosexual, attempt to turn, etc. Somewhat incompatible for me personally, as an introvert, as I find the in your face attitude about it to be off putting at a human level, regardless on my views of homosexuality. (Everyone has free will, and the right to chose their lives, just be good to one another.) In all honesty, I've probably known people who are gay, who I never thought were gay, because they didn't play into the stereotypes.

I honestly think that the requirement that everyone know about your sexuality is a way to alienate people to start with. Perhaps it is a defense tactic. Either you need the validation, or you want to seek approval, or you want to spot potential threats.


My observations ymmv. If we cannot have a realistic discussion on the downsides, the irritating, the bewildering, or the hateful, we can never hope to understand each other to start with. ",0

685,"Welllll it took three different doctors and two hospitals six years to actually diagnose me with a cardiac problem.

Yeah. I’d go in with chest pain, back pain, left arm numb.

They ER’s would hook me up to EKG machines, do x-rays, draw blood... and then send me home saying I wasn’t having a heart attack.

The Docs would have me run on treadmills with EKG machines... and then send me home saying I wasn’t having a heart attack.

Stomach docs would prescribe more and more stomach meds that consistently didn’t work.

Finally after six years a *nurse*, watching me run in pain on a treadmill and an EKG machine (with normal EKG), said “You know what? I’m tellin that doc you need a nuclear stress test.”

Thankfully the doc agreed because the nuke found an “abnormality” on the left side of my heart.

The cardiac cath showed that “abnormality” to be a 99% block of the LAD (The Widowmaker).

One big ass metal soda straw later and I’m climbing up stairs and bicycling pain free.

But not symptomatic free.

I still get the same symptoms I had before, just not after exercise.

Turns out the nerves for “you’re having a heart attack” pain *are the exact* same nerves for “you’re having bad indigestion” pain.

Know what causes indigestion besides bad sushi?

Anxiety that’s what.

Anxiety and stress cause acid buildup and GERD and esophagitis.

Which causes more anxiety because everytime I go to the ER they draw blood, take an X-ray, hook me up to an EKG machine...and send me home sayin “You’re not having a heart attack”.

Here’s what I’ve learned about cardiac problems:

If you want to save someone’s life, carry chewable aspirin with you.

Aspirin and CPR has almost an order of magnitude better success rate over CPR alone.

Do Not just start taking aspirin without talking to a doc.
Even 81mg aspirin can mess you up over the long term.

STOP EATING SO MUCH SUGAR

No really. Sugar irritates the arterial walls and allows for cholesterol to collect on the walls.

I know. Its tough finding any food in a box or bottle which doesn’t have “added sugar” but it’s doable.

Alcohol counts as sugar.

Get up and move.

Go for walks.

Bike.

Got back together, broke it off, got it back together.

One of those growing experiences where we both needed to grow up. And we did. She was visiting--part of the cause of the breakup was she'd had to move about 200 miles away for work. After we both decided we wanted to really try, she was going to give notice and move back.

Within 48 hours, she'd suffered a paradoxic embolism. We'd only known each other two and a half years, I can't imagine how much harder it is when it's been a lifetime. And that last question, asking if she can go.. that'll be with you forever. I remember hearing the same, and there will be times during a day--quiet times--where I can hear her say it. Right next to me.

Talk to someone, please. Don't.. medicate your feelings away. I buried myself in a bottle for months after it happened to me, and all it will do is put things off. And that kind of emotional shattering, it accrues compound interest when you don't deal with it. And it scare people. 

There is nothing that you can do wrong, to try and find a way to get a sense of normalcy back. There are no rules for you, so long as you're coping. Eventually, you're going to get mad. And then later, you're going to feel shame about being mad at this person you love. Save yourself the trouble. Try to throttle that back, analyze why you're shifting in emotional spectrums, if it happens.

> How do I live anymore when all 26 of my years of life were spent loving somebody who I can't live for anymore? How do I make it worth it to go forward now? I want a life, but right now I'm living in a shadow and it's too much to bear even to leave bed some days. How do you handle it? Does it ever get any better than this?

Emotions are tricky. But in cases like this, you can use them to lie to yourself a little--to get through the day, even.

""What would she want me to do?""

She wouldn't want you to be broken. She would know you'd mourn, it's natural. But do you think she'd want your life to be forever fragmented? You wrote that you lived for her. I've never met you and I've never met her, but I'm willing to bet that she lived for you, too.

Honor that. Honor her judgment--make yourself worthy of that judgment. You don't need to go out and start dating, that would be a terrible, terrible idea. You're going to want to hide away, and for a while, that's expected. I am very anti-social, because large groups give me a lot of anxiety. But I found that, after spending a lot of time being.. very, very hurt and crushed, I found strength in being around others.

You'll see couples. And it'll be hard for a while. You had that once and you wish you still did. And then, one day, you're going to realize ""I had that once. And I want it again.""

I make no guarantee that, one day, you'll let this go. I don't think I will. But it'll become part of who you are. It'll integrate into your personality. Hopefully, you won't take a tinge toward bitterness, but that might happen. Whenever I wanted to be angry, I remembered how my girlfriend hated the look on my face when I was angry. And I didn't want to disrespect that, when I thought of her.

I wish you all the luck in the world. This will get better - it won't go away, but the pain will scar a little as it heals. Force yourself out of bed. Even if it's to take a shower, drive around the block. My girlfriend loved going on drives, and I avoided those routes for a long time, because they were *our* streets.

Not just in the sense that she would most likely have wanted you to find happiness and meaning in the future, but in the fulfillment of her passions, of her hopes, of the very things that made her the unique person you took into your life. Help move that cause she believed in, bring comfort to others in your shoes, be the son her family now needs.

A grief counselor can give you the tools and methods to help yourself process what you are going through and build your life in a healthier manner than if you were just slogging through it yourself. Please, utilize these people to help make a terrible ordeal less daunting and manageable. 

Also, it may help to think about what if the roles were switched? What if you were the one to die and she lived. What advice would you give to her. What would your hopes for her be? Follow that advice. Also, what do you think she would tell you right now? Just because she isn't physically here doesn't mean she is out of your life. She has left an indelible mark on your life, and as gut wrenching as that can be, it can also be a comfort. She may have passed, but you haven't lost her in that you probably know exactly what she would tell you to do. She will still continue to influence your life and that is a good thing.

711,"My wife and I have been married 12 years (been together for nearly 15), have two kids, and we have never freely farted in front of each other. We've farted in front of each other by accident, but when possible, we both make a reasonable effort to excuse ourselves from the room if we need to pass gas. We also give each other privacy in the bathroom. 

But, we also still have an excellent sex life and we both agree that making the effort to not be gross in front of each other contributes to us still finding each other attractive. 

Some people are free-farters and love being around the same, and others aren't. Neither my wife, nor I, are compatible with free-farters, I don't think. We're not uptight, but we appreciate  the effort made on each other's part to not just let ourselves go. Other's find comfort in it, I suppose.",0

713,"I'm sorry to hear all that... sounds like you've got some perspective on it though, and here's one thing I'd add on top of it. Carl Jung talked about a particular kind of healer that can only come from certain kinds of injuries early in life. I know it can feel like that kind of self sacrifice and that kind of love is worth something and valuable, it's seductive... and I think part of the reason is because it can turn into something genuinely rare and healthy that not a lot of people are capable of. Sometimes the things that fuck with us the most become our greatest strength when we work through them. It's worth continuing that journey, so good luck finding the right kind of help. (personally, i think everyone should go through a few years of therapy of some kind, really unfortunate how it's been demonized as being for 'crazy' people).

It definitely starts though with finding a passion and a purpose outside of relationships though. Somewhere you can find energy, worth, pride.. that you can then bring home with you after a good day of being the kind of person you'd be proud to be. ",0

The best thing you can do for your grandpa is to live your life as hard and as amazing as you possibly desire, then share as much as you are willing to with him. Introduce him to new ideas, new foods, and new experiences.

Have him share experiences with you! Listen to his stories. Ask him about his favorite old songs and use Spotify to listen with him. Let the playlist feature find new ones that y’all can both enjoy. What were his favorite things to do in his younger days? Do them in a way that he can now! 

More than anything though, take care of yourself. It’s hard enough to be alive and go through the day dealing with your own life. Don’t look back later and stress over what you did or didn’t do for an old man at 70 who’d given up. Sure, do your best so you won’t regret not trying.

720,"I work in mental health and here's what we suggest for older patients:


Seriously think about if he is depressed. Suicide is more common than you would think with older adults. They often fail to cope with limited mobility, loneliness, and aging in general. Also, they often have less protective factors than younger people. You mentioned that he had a bypass- talk with his doctor about the possibility of vascular depression.


Find an activity that he can do with other people on a regular basis. Older people often suffer from loneliness because of their decreased mobility and the deaths of old friends and family. Finding an activity with other people would give him a reason to leave the house and make new friends. Look into an elder care day program that he can go to a few times a month. Some non-profit organizations do it for free. (Obviously, this is not something you can do right now because of the COVID-19 outbreak, but you can plan for it when this is over)


Does he like animals? Think about getting him a pet, something that he would be able to care for mostly by himself. The bond with a pet can give he a reason to get out of bed in the morning.


He has a passion for maintenance work, so go with that. There are tons of forums and subreddits of people asking maintenance questions on cars, machines, anything. If he gets into that, you could even get him a webcam so he can see/talk to some people he's met online. 


Check out nia.nih.gov. They have good information that can also help.",0

723,"**(I'm not a guy but I was at a nursing school before my car accident and I just listed a few things below that we were taught)**

Honestly, when I was studying this in nursing, we were trained to basically just keep actively communicating with them; whether it's a one-on-one talk, bringing in the reinforcements (and educating their family on talking to them more often), or get our patients to interact with other patients who're going through something similar (sort of like a support group).

We're trained to let our patients do most of the talking because usually it involves some form of emotional/psychological trauma and/or response that is actively working as a barrier for them to ""get better"" (and yes, smoking and stress can always make things worse for patients).

You can try to get him talking about a topic he's passionate about, up to the point where you won't be able to say much but listen. We also only ask open-ended questions that lead to ""open communication"" versus ""closed communication"", meaning we only ask questions that doesn't require a single response for an answer. No yes/no questions. But simple ones like: Why? Why \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_? 

I'm not sure if this is of any help but that is basically the sum of a chapter of what we were taught. Also, pay attention to verbals and non-verbals. Always tilt/face your body to him while you guys are speaking.. don't cross your arms and/or legs. And don't stare at him. We also learned that patients don't like it when you stand over them to talk versus talking to them on the same level they are on (like sitting down on a chair if they're on a bed, etc.). Hope your grandpa is doing alright. And I hope you are too...

It helped my dad, his chest, his mental health some, the warmth helped warm him from the inside out kinda, lol. Not for hours... But for a little while. My dad really enjoyed it after his bypass, the sun is great and necessary, the vitamin d helps, etc. Go on short little walks.... Start super small.. Work up slowly. Literally around the house inside may be a starting point.. Then move outside, then around the outside, around property line, out to the mailbox, then to the nextdoor neighbors house, then try one more house after walking several times to the first house, love into second, get comfortable walking that far, move onto the next house, etc. Tell him you NEED him to do this. If not for himself right now, then for you. Talk to him about his past, his adventures in his younger years, working in the mines, what it was like, was he ever scared? How did he overcome those fears? You may even consider voice recording or even video recording him during these conversations. Tell him, be brutally honest and open about this, how much you learned from him, that you learned what it meant to be a man. Find things y'all could work on or fix together. If he can't handle doing it with his own hands, request he guide you since you're going to need some knowledge as you age/ grow up too. If you can't figure out something to have him work on, see if you can find any old things from a thrift store near by that you can get and say you really liked it but can't seem to get it to work. Or check out eBay or Craigslist for some older electronics, tools, etc. 

If he's being a real piece of work, an ass or being a dick to others sometimes (hard and set in his stubborn ways that sometimes can lead to grumpy old guys being an ass to others, lol)... Tell it to him straight. Be honest. Say you're being a dick about this. You still have life to live. We aren't done with you yet here. You havent seen me do these things, experienced these with me, etc etc. I know it's hard. I know it hurts. But we all know your a badass and can handle it. So do it for us.

735,"What has he taught you about being a man? Can you elaborate what that means to you and him? I cannot be sure but it might be part of the problem. 

What happens often to old people or those with increasing disabilities is that they can lose their sense of purpose and meaning. You are describing a man who has worked his body to the bone and who now physically cannot even get up to mow the lawn. It is likely that he equates a lot of his value to feats of physical labour and to providing financially for his family. (You know, the way capitalism can inspire men to think of themselves...)

Now his body is broken and others rely less and less on him. On some level he may think a man shouldn't rely too much on others and he doesn't want to waste other people's time and effort trying to fix him while they could be doing better things. 

If this is the case, then the most important thing is this: Your grandpa has value even if he cannot work. Your grandpa has value even when he's just sitting there waiting to die. You already know this, because you made this post. It's likely he doesn't know. You may need to point-blank tell him so and also that you love him regardless of what condition his body is in. If you cannot say this, say it with actions. The best way to do this is just to spend time with him without any expectations of his recovery. Talk to him, be as open as you can about your life, ask him for advice or his opinion on things. Or say nothing and sit in the garden or in front of the TV together. Just be there.

He will enjoy it and feel he contributes something to your life and to others in ways that he possibly hasn't considered much before (just by being someone's friend, by making people laugh, passing on knowledge and skills, etc.). If he can value life through that perspective he just might get up and do the work to stick around longer. Not for himself but for others. In the end it will be his decision to make, but if it doesn't work, you will at least still have made the most of your time together.",0

I think he finds comfort in being listened to (as we all do). That is the only advice I have to give, do your best to spend time with your grandfather and ask him about life and even the uncomfortable things like how he feels about death. Old people aren’t afraid to talk about uncomfortable things. Try to understand his perspective as much as you can so that you can make peace and respect whatever decisions he makes about his life. It may inadvertently give him a will to live, especially if you find out things he likes and make plans to do things with him in the future like make his favorite food for him or whatever.

I littered some links below as well for more reading. 

To be clear yes, we are talking about Magic Mushrooms.  Yes they are halucinagenic, yes they are really far out, but they also tend to transform the lives of those who use them for the better especially in the case of end of life care. 

Now I understand that this suggestion might seem extreme and the payoff lofty, but I have personally had a trip change my life. I was a single 350lb disabled veteran who was on the verge of suicide. I was offered to try mushrooms by a friend and it was the single most transformative experience in my life. 

Since then I have lost 70 lbs, found a person who loved me for who I was we got married, discovered a love of philosophy and an appreciation for the world around me. More over I learned to accept myself and remembered that I was worth making effort for. It truly changed my life. 

Now I know what you are prolly thinking. ""This guy is nuts"" but there are studies that back this up and if he wouldn't be massively opposed to it, you might consider this route.  I really and truly hope that he is able to remember that he is worth trying for, with or without a trip. 

Good luck friend.

743,"> I’m just getting over my own “waiting to die” mentality

My grandfather passed away in 2014. He was older, obviously, but not old. If healthy, he'd likely would have had another 20 years in him. Sadly, not at all healthy. 

When we've discussed my grandparents, my mom has always said ""They've been old my whole life"". Basically - Even when in their 20s/early 30s raising my mom and uncle, they acted like elderly people waiting to die. Not active, adventurous, ambitious, curious, nothing. Not feeling like the world is positive or happy or reliable. Always bitter, really.

It blew my mind when I looked back and realized they were in their 40s when they became grandparents (when I was born). My entire childhood memories with them are ""elderly"" so I just figured they were always old. The only TV they watched was the weather channel on mute. They woke up at 3-4AM every morning as long as I can remember. They spent their days sitting in rocking chairs occasionally saying a short sentence to each other or doing a word search puzzle. But most of all, so little seemed to truly bring them happiness. 

Long story short - I am glad you've found some help and peace <3 I wouldn't wish a miserable ""waiting to die"" life on anyone else.",0

751,"It's far easier to reduce your need for willpower than to increase willpower itself. To do that, you need to reduce stress, increase energy, decrease your mental burden and increase your mental reward.

You reduce your stress and increase your energy by exercising and stretching. Of course, you might need willpower to exercise, but imo, if you're going to use your willpower anywhere you should use it for exercising. It's really that important.

Decreasing burden and increasing reward are basically about improving motivation. It's become popular lately to dismiss motivation and say that discipline is all that matters. While I agree that motivation isn't necessary to actually do anything, and that discipline is often necessary, I disagree that motivation should be ignored. Motivation can be constructed and maintained through CBT techniques and writing.

Mindfulness meditation is another thing people will mention. I think it's helpful, but mindfulness is kind of like discipline because they both involve a bypass effect in the mind.

With mindfulness, you bypass your normal brain activity by maximizing awareness. With discipline, you bypass your normal brain activity by outlasting its effect. In both cases, you're not directly doing anything to existing circuitry, you're just waiting for the brain to choose a different path. Over time that will result in changes, but it's definitely ""over time"".

But with CBT and writing, you do something that's nearly the opposite. Instead of bypassing normal brain activity, you crank everything up and reverse the ""flow"" directly at what's troubling you. It's violent and much more immediately effective. Instead of constantly having to bypass brain circuits you don't like, you just destroy them.

At least, that's how it feels to me.

I actually disagree with CBT's insistence that thoughts ultimately cause emotions, but I can't argue against the effectiveness of the writing exercises. They've helped me a lot and I now immediately go to writing about my behavior when I'm not satisfied with it. The book that really helped me is, ""Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy"".",0

Heart disease runs in my family too. My dad had a heart attack when he was 52. He was/is very fit. In fact, he'd run a 10k the day before and won his age group, and was a Boston-caliber marathon runner when he did longer runs. Before that, his mom had a heart attack and quadruple bypass. Several of his family members have similar stories as well. 

His cardiologist actually mentioned that my brother and I should start getting screened for heart disease when we turn 40 since there is such a strong family history. It might be worth looking into when you're older. In the meantime just take the best care of yourself that you can. ",0

My step moms been taking it seriously for the last decade since my grandfather passed, making sure my dad eats healthier.

But them being that overweight in the first place is not the root problem, it's only a symptom of something more sinister, a disorder so deep that they did not care a bit about their own health and were on the path to slow suicide. 

If they had a true endocrine disorder, they get a pass. If not, they might have had some emotional disorder, and I'd really wonder if they had really treated it properly. Surgery only treats the weight issue, it does not treat any underlying emotional problems. This is why I'm frustrated with the show ""My 600lb life"", they mention nothing about treating the patient's emotional status.

762,"Well, my dad died when I was in my early 20s. I was older than you, but still basically a kid. 

The first few of years were rough, especially since it really changed the way my family interacted. A major focal point for all of us was gone. We all kind of scattered. I honestly dealt with it by drinking too much, and distracting myself with music and movies and trivia. It numbed my head and helped me smile and forget, but resulted in 3-4 wasted years. 

I still think about the guy often, but it doesn't hurt now (almost 20 years since he passed).

It still hits me like a ton of bricks in certain situations. My 3-year-old boy asked me where my daddy was the other day, and why he couldn't meet him. Not easy to answer. Other times, I just smile when I catch myself using one of his old expressions. 

Advice? I don't know, man. Try to maintain strong friendships, stay in touch with your family even when they piss you off, allow time to pass, and do the kind of stuff that would make him proud. Use the time that you have. Distance and life experiences are the only things that will really heal you. Sorry for the clichés, but it's all I got. ",0
763,"It was not my direct experience, but I was with my wife for about 6 months when her father died. He actually had a heart attack before she and I got together, but we were friends, and that actually brought us a bit closer, since she didn't really seem to have anyone who was checking on her or her situation.

Their relationship had been rocky since she was a kid, but within the last few months prior, they had come back together, he had really worked on curbing his drinking (he was an alcoholic, and apparently not a very nice one), and they were seeing each other regularly. She was finally able to have that bond she had wanted, and then it was ripped away from her. 

He never fully recovered, and was bed-ridden from that point on. He showed some signs of possibly being able to walk again, and was working on his speech, but it eventually got to a stopping point. I believe he stopped at around the mental capacity near a 4-5 year old, and was not strong enough to feed himself.

Eventually he was sent home from the care facility, and he began to decline a bit more rapidly. He stopped eating, and lost weight quickly.

Once he got that sick, my wife (girlfriend at the time) went and saw him more regularly. 

Eventually he passed, and I was actually out of town working at the time. She was crushed, and at 18 had to help plan her father's funeral. I cannot imagine her feeling.

She actually came to work with me for several days, because she actually couldn't handle being at work, or sitting at home alone after they sent her home. She would just cry at certain points, after something would remind her of him.

Later that week, we went to his funeral (fitting weather, dreary, rainy, and cool), and that was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. She was obviously broken up about it, and once the ceremony started, it was horrible. Seeing her so crushed and upset really got to me. She said her goodbyes, and we went and spent some time with her grandparents, since they lived close by. We hung out for a few hours, but still had a number of hours to drive back.

She asked me if we could stop by the grave site one more time before going home. Little did I know, the hardest part was coming.

We went back out to the grave site, her still upset, but not currently crying. We walked back out to his plot, and the tears just started up again. I asked her if she wanted some time alone, and she said yes. I walked away to give her some space, and just watched from a distance. I've never seen anything just crush me and make me cry like that. Seeing a daughter who had finally been able to re-kindle her relationship with her father, and then that was ripped from her within a year's time, and having to say goodbye in a secluded graveyard in the dreary rain was something I don't think I've ever felt such sorrow over. And it wasn't even my father.

I do often times have questions for her about how she's doing, I try to not ask too much as I don't want to continually bring him up, but I don't know what it's like, I've never been through it. 

She tells me she has her good days and bad days, but that it can hurt just as badly on some of the worst bad days. The bad days seem to lessen in frequency, but I'm sure they will probably never go away entirely. I just try to make sure I'm there for her when she needs me. ",0
764,"There wasn't one determining factor or specific incident that made me want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just woke up one morning, and I knew. It helps that my wife was my best friend before we even started dating. She's kind, compassionate, selfless, smart, funny, hard working, and beautiful. We shared a vision of what we wanted our lives and marriage to look like. She's my biggest cheerleader and a teammate I can count on to always have my back.

765,"She’s amazing, but she has awful situational awareness and is far too trusting of/open to people.

I’m pretty hypervigilant (I grew up in the hood), where she is a sheltered white lady...so I spent more time than I’d like “managing” her so she doesn’t get us into some dumb shit.

She’s one off those “Strangers are just friends you haven’t met yet” people. She sees the potential for a fascinating interaction.

I see the potential for all sorts of problems.

She’s the type of person to try and invite strangers to interact with us because they’re there, and she’s “Curious about people”. One time, we’ve got a giant Jenga game to ourselves, and she spots another couple:

“Diablo! Do you want to invite those people to play Jenga with us?” She asked excitedly.

“No”, I replied, unable to think of anything I wanted less in the moment than a needless exposure to two complete strangers, their biases, and their problems.

For me, it’s the choice between continuing to play this game with my partner in peace, or hang out with some random people who are probably crazy.

Not a hard choice for me. We already got the game in lock. No need to sully it with other people.
 
She’s the type of person to see a person tweaking out and slow WAY down as she walks past instead of speed up, because if she moves too quickly, she he might spot her.

That was last week.

The type to tell random passers-by in the lobby of our AirBnB where we’re from, how long we’re in town, and nearly what apartment we were staying in had I not nudged her with my foot to get her to stop spilling our business.

The type that will decide that the middle of the sidewalk in downtown Chicago with our suitcases is a great place to just stop while we look for directions because “it’ll be fine!”, instead of find somewhere out of everyone’s way where we can look up directions and not announce to the world that we are from out of town and don’t know where we are.

The type that will try and stop and have a conversation with the Jehovas witnesses in the crowded train station at rush hour while we’re running late for an appointment, our train is coming in, and people are actively trying to get past us to the platform to catch the train, like we should be doing.


Basically, if there’s a bad situation to be had, she will try to find ways to insert herself/us into them, create them through lack of situational awareness and/or consideration for the people around her, or involve us through needless involvement with the people around us.


You ever play a game where you have escort an NPC through a stage, and the hard part is that the NPC keeps running into danger or alerting the enemies to your presence?

Hanging with my SO around other people is like that.


We’ve talked about it a few times, and we’ve reached some semblance of a compromise, but I mostly just try to arrange our dates and steer us so that we’re not around too many people.

If I see a crowd of people a block ahead, I know to hang a left, because she will want to go check out what the crowd is doing, talk to a bunch of them, breathe the same air, and exchange information about our personal lives with them.

Rather the dinner in a populated area, I’m picking somewhere secluded so she’s not constantly trying to invite people to talk to us.

Boiled down, I try to avoid being around her AND around other people, because she’s drawn to people.

It’s fine, except when she tries to drag me along.

**tldr**

She’s gregarious and extrovert. I’m insular, misanthropic, and introverted.
She tries to interact with people when we’re together, I try to avoid people when we’re together, and awkwardness often ensues.

Aside from removing us from threatening situations, most of what I deal with is annoying, dead-end conversations with meaningless people...so I try to arrange things to achieve minimal opportunities for exposure to people.",0

Not the is-she-faithful or will-she-blow-my-money kind of trust, though those are certainly important. But, being able to trust her perception of you won't change the first time she sees you cry, the first time you can't open the pickle jar or the first time you are blindsided by an anxiety attack. As men, we have an image we like to maintain. Your life partner is the one person in the world you no longer feel the need to maintain an image with.

768,"Therapy.  I'm serious.

My father was an abusive alcoholic for a lot of my childhood and adolescence, though he's since gotten his act together.  When I was a little older, I learned a bit about his history - a parent who died when he was a toddler, emigration in childhood, and a few other things that would definitely send someone spiraling if they didn't have the capacity to cope with it.  And he didn't.  Recently I reached the age he was when things started going downhill for him - he had two kids and a mortgage, and I've got a two cats and a goddamn playstation.  It was stress on top of trauma, and he didn't know how to handle it.

It is *incredibly difficult* to have compassion for people whose trauma, through little fault of their own, has been dumped on you like that.  I'm getting there - I recognize that there were forces that he just didn't have the tools to deal with and I had the misfortune of being economically dependent on him.  But acknowledging that doesn't get my adolescence back, and I still have occasions where I think back to what's happened and become extremely angry - at him - in the moment.  It feels like one step short of a flashback.  Over the last ten years or so I have made incredible personal strides overcoming the effects that living in that household for 20 years had on me, which only further illuminates the possibilities - the person  that I could have been - if things were different.  It's wasted potential, an alternate reality that thinking about feels like watching a party through a living room window from the sidewalk outside before continuing on my way.

You seem to have the right outlook - you appear to be angry at the situation and not the person, and you want to not feel the way you do about an unwell individual.  It is my recommendation that you tell a therapist everything that you put in your OP.  It's well-written enough that you could probably just print it off and hand it to him/her.

Good luck.",0

771,"It depends on what you are going through but **PATIENCE** is a big factor. It takes a long time and a lot of work to be in a position where you are able to support yourself while simultaneously being in pain.


**DO NOT BLOCK** out your emotions and try to ""push through it"". Try an approach like this example. You are feeling anxious/sad/angry over something. Notice that feeling. Say to yourself, or more accurately to *those emotions*, ""thank you for trying to help and protect/defend me, I appreciate your efforts, but I don't need that right now.""


Find a form of **EXPRESSION** to get it out. Set some time (just 5 or 10 mins may be enough) daily or as needed to journal on pen and paper or spam your keyboard with what's in your head. Allocating time can alleviate the fixation/thought loop aspect of it all. Additionally any artistic form works. Poetry, drawing, crafting, making music. Creativity is a good way to get into flow state. Just DO some activity.


**LEARN** about everything your mind is going through. The psychology of it, the nuances, concepts of experiences, how they affect you, triggers, reactions you have, how to react better than your default, outdated wiring. Read, watch videos, listen to podcasts, research. Anything that directs you to better understanding is useful.


Have a little set of **PHRASES** you look at every day to affirm things and solidify positive concepts in your head. E.g. ""This too shall pass"", ""self-compassion"", ""patience"", ""accept how you feel and allow it to pass""., ""Remember to breathe"". It's cringe but it can be useful to nudge your mind in a better direction.


Use mediums that **HELP YOU FEEL** your way through things. Music, movies etc. They can be good tools to comfort you in your pain through empathetic means. Music for me is like a best friend.


Add moments of **SELF CARE**, it doesn't have to be as drastic or cringe as people use the term nowadays, just small moments where you treat yourself to a casual treat. Crack open a beer, let yourself outside for some greenery and air, put on a face mask, make some hot chocolate, take a nice soak in a bath. Something small to distract.


If things are more severe and you are seriously in a bad state of mind and unable to escape, call your country's hotline (it isn't only for if you are about to jump off a bridge). Sometimes we really are pushed to require other people, and an actual voice is necessary at times. Before this stage, if there is any possibility of contacting someone you trust like a friend or family member, do that first. It can be incredibly hard to reach out and use others but I believe it's necessary as a prerequisite to making yourself your most reliable point of contact.

790,"> do you sometimes worry about your friendships... Do you sometimes feel forgotten or passed over?

Not really.

In Nicomachaean Ethics, Aristotle posited that there are three kinds of friendship:

* The Friendship of Utility: You're friends with this person because they're useful to you somehow. This is the guy who spots you at the gym but you otherwise don't hang out with, or the coworker you get along well with but have no clue what goes on in their personal life, or the neighbor who lends you their lawnmower when yours is in the shop.

* The Friendship of Pleasure: You're friends with this person because they're pleasant to be around. This is your FWB, or your weekend drinking buddy.

* The Friendship of Virtue: You're friends with this person because of their qualities, not because of what they have to offer you. Each of you inspires the other to be a better person.

It's not surprising when the friendships of Utility or Pleasure taper off and end: once the person's usefulness to you (or yours to them) wears off, there's really no reason to keep investing effort in the friendship.

The Friendship of Virtue is the kind that lasts and is worth investing yourself in.",0
791,"IMO, as long as we're initiating with our friends enough, we should never be forgotten or passed over.  
Particularly after we get out of school, friendships take effort to maintain.  If we aren't putting in any effort, then the other person/people are and that's when we start risking being forgotten or passed over.",0
792,"I feel guilty for not keeping better track of people sometimes, but not forgotten or passed over.  I'm terrible at maintaining relationships and I know it, so I can't exactly feel like someone did it to me or it was some result of life's randomness I had no control over.",0

The more difficult task really is to ensure you don't go so far overboard the other direction that you screw your child up in another way.  

If you practice a degree of restraint with everything, and everything is done in moderation, your children will be fine. 

What they really need are:

* Your time, care and concern.
* Proper discipline on behaviour, manners, etiquette
* Proper setting and enforcement of boundaries
* Set expectations & encouragement

Just moderate. It's fine if you aren't perfect, but make sure you show them another side as well. For example, if you reprimand them, make sure you also praise them at other times. Make sure you are fair. It's only when they grow up hearing reprimand all the time or praise all the time that they end up imbalanced and messed up.

It's even OK to tell your child you are disappointed, as long as you also regularly tell them how proud of them you are.

Don't get so caught up with trying to undo your parents' flaws that you introduce other flaws. Children are resilient. As long as you are fair, they will understand.",0

I’ve learned that about my parents, and sometimes I catch myself being less than I want to be with my kids. The kicker is that, despite your best efforts, your children may resent you for something they deem to be wanting in your role as a parent. Let them have their opinions. You have yours. But love your parents and your kids either way, and stuff will turn out for the best. It’s a tall order, but what we practice, we usually become good at. Practice compassion.",0

Honestly, do whatever you want when you pronounce the E. That I can forgive. Hell, make it a silent E for all I care, it would still be less irritating than hearing you consistently say the word ""chi-pol-tay"".",0

816,"I ditched most of my high-school classes, then tested out in the last few weeks of senior year with a generic pass-fail grade. I lived a block from the school, and had a swimming pool, so I'd show up for homeroom, and my comp-Sci and physics classes because they had the same teacher and his wife worked with my mother, so if I didn't show up there, I'd have been caught. But then at lunch, I'd gather up my friends (mostly girls) and we'd hop the fence and go back to my house to hang out poolside. Good times.

But the classes were not difficult. Granted it wasn't a great school. But I easily aced all the exit exams without any study. And I'm smart, but not a super genius or anything. The only thing I struggled with academically was paying attention. Glad My parents didn't put me on rittolin like so many other kids of my generation, I'm happier not being a 4' tall meth addict like most of those other kids turned out.

820,"I think you should get an appointment at your own bank in order to get someone to help you build an investment portfolio. I have a friend who did that when her mother passed. She now have a secured future financially and she didn't had to be a financial mogul to get there. Respect and listen to everything they tell you. Also keep some money aside for you. If you invest the whole thing and need money in a year from now you might loose a pourcentage of it. Lots of investment needs to stay at least two years (sometimes more) before you can withdraw them without penality.

If you want to trade you'd be safer starting with mock account. Lots of platforms offer this and use the real stock market which can help you understand. Read a lot about it. It's not easy as movies and YouTube videos would like us to think. I cannot stress this enough do not trade your money without taking the time to read everything and get informed properly 

Real estate can be a good investment. Not financially wise. With this economic climate don't invest in real estate thinking you'll be the next Barbara Corcoran because you most likely won't. I personally see Real Estate as a good investment in your future. A friend of mine bought a triplex and his mortgage is paying itself with the rent from his two renters and he has a almost free of charge place to live. Real estate ain't like it was before it is a long shot long run investment but it is a good one!",0
821,"Since it's AskMen and not any of the finance subs, the way I've always dealt with windfalls is in thirds:  1/3 for stupid shit ( the ol' hookers and blow fund ... or whatever your stupid thing is ), 1/3 for paying debts and investments, 1/3 for capital improvements to your life ( purchases that make your day to day meaningfully better over at least 10 years -  a new car or a new microwave or whatever friction cash can fix in your day to day ).

With millions, the hookers and blow fund might be ginormous so you might want to scale that back.  Or donate it to causes you ( or the giver ) care about.  Or give it to friends and family or whatever.  Or buy your buddy a lambo.

The capital fund is probably best for your house and cottage at that scale.  Just make sure that it doesn't hurt your career.  If you're living paycheque to paycheque and hate your job go back to school and use the fun fund to get it done.  The point is to spend this bucket on meaningfully ( and it's key that the purchases are meaningful ) improving your life.  If you don't know what's meaningful to you, roll this into the debt and capital fund until you do.

Pay all your debts first and then talk to a financial advisor for the remainder in the investment fund.  This is what you'll pass to the next generation and it's your responsibility to manage it well.

Also, windfalls are never things that change my job's ability to fund my life - that's always mine and earned by me through my work and personal luck.

No matter how much is left to you, I would watch out for the ennui from not needing to work or living solely off of passive income and having nothing meaningful in your life besides the next mai tai.  It also makes it easier to deal with guilt and imposter syndrome and whatever else negative comes into your life from having a pile of cash.  If you like your job, don't tell anyone and just keep at it.  Just because you can do nothing, doesn't mean that will make your life happy.

Best of luck!",0

You have to cultivate your circle for the time.  Some people will remain in there forever, and some people will pass through.

Look at the human population (7.8 billion... BILLION) rather the 200,000.. it can make anyone feel small but the reason I’m bringing this up is how many people can you give a f#$k about? Because we are busy.. busy humans dealing with whatever bull$@&t we were born into and trying to live out everyday with the need to constantly satisfy ourselves. 

Taking all this situational BS into account some people don’t care even for their own keen, it’s sad truly; but that is what makes it so beautiful when you find people to call your own.

Finding people you can call your own can be tough sometimes but looking at people who care about another person at a lower level, you can take this comment section as an example for we cared/had a respect for this person we didn’t even know about and taking the time/emotion to share with you.

Something Iv done is start by understanding yourself and I know that sound fickle and cliche to say) but knowing that you probably think and review everything you see and do constantly, and take great consideration into your action and are probably pretty self aware, it does the mind good to take a step out of yourself and understand yourself outside of your own shoes and try and think of yourself in a grander scale. Yes we will all be one of those deaths. And being known or appreciated and missed seldomly actually coincide, the my most humble greatest man that has ever lived has came and passed and I'm sure not a soul ever really knew him or appreciated him and is probably lost in time. People will love and miss Kim kasdashiam and Justin beiber but have no inherent value. Don't let your value amd people perception and care for you share their meanings. We are all going to live here and being able to live with yourself is a value of its own, doing what your can for the people around you truly with out appreciation has its own rewards, and just being apart of a community anyway you can will give you some center, because trust me wanting the need to be known and understood is a fruitless effort cause if your pushing to have it, that will get further away, in that respect, let that part come to you",0

He used to show me old black and white horror movies when I was a kid (Night of the Living Dead, Dracula, etc.), and I've rewatched some of them and checked out some new ones recently. To someone looking in it probably seems like I just enjoy old movies. Sometimes people care in their own way.

833,"It’s true that if any of us pass along the world will continue, as it always has for eternity no matter who dies, such is the nature of the world.  But I feel your sentiment too.  my younger brother feels a lot like what you describe.  He attempted to leave the family in a really weird way which I won’t get into too deep (but he sent an email basically saying goodbye), but he though that no one cares about him and it wouldn’t be a big deal and he wouldn’t be missed.  He was wrong, very wrong and we made sure to let him know this. The thing is that he has always been a bit of a know it all (he’s 28) and distanced in life, no matter how we approach him he knows it all and has always been distant and pretends like everything is ok
When it obviously isn’t - avoiding being honest with your situations in a way denies those around you to respond to it honestly. Basically some elements of it are mental health related for him and some of us how he has chosen consciously or not to engage with the world.  I’m not saying this is it isn’t what your going through I can only share my experience that your not alone in this feeling and hope some sort of it provides some insight.  And I would tell you the same thing I told my brother and why I have experienced.  Don’t believe everything you think, and about what other people think especially.  Some family really does suck though, I recently lost my father and I think that sort of put him over the edge.  The upshot is he’s finally starting to deal with his feeling or recognize that he has been suppressing them which is a step in the right direction.  You are not alone, I have a big family and in our grief each of us goes through that process differently, so it is for everyone it’s not really for anyone else to determine how one “should” process such things, us humans don’t come with instruction manuals lol.  while going through that process I learned that some people I thought were my rocks in life turned out not to be, and some people surprised me with how strongly and supportive they were especially in the beginning when I was going through such a tough place.  We think we know so much about the character of the people around us but in truth we all live in our heads more then we do in reality and it can color our experience Ma and behaviors.  On close friends I am of the type for quality over quantity, but I hit a couple phases where I realized my circle was a lot smaller then I thought and it was tough, but with the right mentality those tough times ended up being my times of greatest growth (I’m in my early 40s).  Focus on what brings you joy and the relationships with the people that do so as well, for me this is a combination of intuition/feeling and logic.  The people around us tend to react to a combination of where they’re at in their headspace and where we’re at in ours, both influencing each other, keep the company of those that have a healthy dynamic with you in this way where you make each other better.",0
834,"Do you want people to sit around and dwell on thoughts of you a lot? I don't think that's a reasonable idea. People are self centered. They are concerned with their own wants, needs, desires. If their concerns involve you then you are thought of frequently. If you are more peripheral to their experience, then you are thought of much less. Being understood is a whole other kettle of fish. To understand someone, really KNOW them, requires exposure to them over time and a variety of situations. A track record is created until they KNOW what you'll do or say...and then you do or say something they didn't expect. Humans are a very multifaceted critter, that's what makes us semi interesting. I consider myself as pretty average. The people who KNOW me is an extremely small number. There are some people who have experienced facets of me, but there are facets of the diamond they have zero clue about. I like it that way. I am a very self contained person, need very little in the way of validation or approval. Others are very much different. Social platforms are their natural habitat. You are familiar with people who live their lives on social media. To me, that is totally alien. With all that said, I am quite empathetic and conscious of others moods and feelings. I have a step daughter who literally felt compelled to 'make' everyone like her. It was hard for her to absorb that there are people who simply are NOT going to be wild about her. My attitude is 'take me or leave me', and usually I'm happy if they leave me. Different strokes for different folks.",0
835,"You can have a life where people care about you. But, that only happens through selfless acts. You don't draw many people thinking only about yourself. I don't know your background or what trials you've faced but, for me I know this to be true experientially. When I was going through a trying time in my life I met a person who I can't even really call a friend but, they bought me food when they saw I was starving. This was all they did yet I remember them still almost a decade after they died and still I miss them. Just a chance meeting caused that much and more. Because they were kind to me I lived long enough to be kind to others. Compassion and selfless acts are like a fire that grows and grows warming each person who comes to it. Each person taking some warmth away with them perhaps to start their own fires.

And if this warmth is all of me that will live on, i'll be remembered more than well enough. I don't know if you know this but, it's very common for people who are abused to abuse their kids in an self replicating cycle. It's a sad truth. However, I believe it's also true that a good heart and right treatment may be passed down as well. So perhaps the good acts you do will never truly die.",0

There was a guy who I took some classes with. We sat next to each other, shared study guides, and talked about future academic plans. We never hung out outside of class. 

He took his life in our senior year. It sucked and it hurt so deeply. I never told him, but I really admired him and was excited for his future. I still think about him frequently. I hate that the world was deprived of a genuinely awesome guy. I hate that he didn't get to live out his goals or just experience his life. 

Everyone in our class, everyone in his really close friend group went on to graduate. They went on to find love, travel, or land dream jobs. The world kept turning. 

But we all still think of him and hurt for him. Some of his friends had set up a mental health fundraiser. Some became more compassionate. 

You shouldn't aspire to make other people miserable; you should aim to leave parts of the world better than you found them. Things as small as holding the door open or as big as helping someone in a bad situation. It all counts.",0
838,This is a western perspective. If you really want inclusion and warmness from others you have to get out of the U.S. or europe. Game theory has ruined us all and we don't know how to be compassionate anymore because society has control of our behaviour. I spent time in Latin America and people there will take you in as if you were family the first day you meet them.,0
839,"I would just like to add that you never truly know how much of an impact you have had on those around you. Before covid, one of my brother’s best friends died in a car crash. I hadn’t really seen him in years or even thought about him but it’s been a year and it still hits me that he’s gone. I am sure he never knew how important his impact on my high school experience was, because to him he was just looking out for his friend’s little sister. However, even just the gesture of looking out for me and making sure the guys I was around didn’t hurt me ended up helping me get out of an actual abusive relationship later on. I really wish I had told him how much the little things he did in passing helped me feel safe and valid enough to leave that guy. 

So yes, we tend to overvalue our position in people’s lives and it can be a rude awakening to realize you aren’t as important as you think you are. But, you never know who you have helped or impacted greatly.",0
840,"First of all, having a bunch of people that actually care about you is, I would say, necessary for your psychological well-being. Being surrounded by your family, although I know that not everyone is lucky enough to have a nice supportive family, is a huge boost. For those who aren’t blessed with one, get yourself out there and make some friends. Don’t force anything tho. Always remember, you are awesome and you deserve some awesome friends too. Don’t expect to build a friendship with anyone, since we are all different and we can’t connect with everyone. That’s also ok. If you find hard the whole process of making friends, I know that this will sound cliche, but start a hobby, which you find interesting. That way, you surround yourself with people who actually share a common interest, a common passion with you. That worked wonders for me. Lastly, I wanna mention my opinion on your question more specifically. Whenever I think that people, the majority of them at least, don’t actually care about you, I feel a sense of freedom, relief and refreshment. Just think about it. You can do whatever the fuck you want and not expect everyone to understand, agree, disagree, support or discourage your actions. Plus, in a imaginary world where everyone cared about you and supported you in every step, you wouldn’t find those special people who would care about you in every case, like the world we live in. The last statement is based on [this video](https://youtu.be/MRJ3WfVe31U), while the rest of this essay are just things that I ended up realising during those wonderful 19 years that I’m on this planet😂.

847,"There will always be at least one person who cares about you more than you think. When you pass away, it doesn’t matter how large the funeral is or how many admirers you have. It’s why funerals for older individuals are smaller, most of the people they know (minus their family that’s younger and kids) have already died. But I can guarantee you that your death will severely impact someone. Whether it be your parents or close friends or maybe someone you didn’t even think would be affected. 

My dog didn’t have a funeral, and my friends didn’t care about my dog as much as I did, and most people didn’t care when she passed. It doesn’t mean that my dog was any less special. I think about her ever day and her death was one of the hardest things I’ve dealt with. It was so hard because of how much she mattered to me and how much I cared about her. My aunt also felt that people didn’t care about her, and I wish people told people how they felt before someone dies, but you should have seen how many of us were at her funeral and an absolute wreck. 

You don’t live your life for the people who don’t care. You life your life for the very few who care a lot, even if you don’t realize they do. You don’t need to feel like it’s a popularity contest. Make it count with the people who matter and when your time comes those are the people who will care.",0

I'm joking, I'm sure this isnt true and even if most dont, some still do, right? You cant expect everyone to just lose their mind and break down because you disappeared or passed away.

You should get some therapy, you sound very emotional and in all honesty a little immature. You need a different perspective.

853,"A few ways:

I remind myself that I don't know that. I've seen people's lives end, and many people around them whom I thought didn't know them, or didn't care about them, have their world *rocked*. 

Related to that one, I don't tell hardly any of the people I care about or who are important to me just how much I care or how important to me they are. It's likely they're all doing the same.

Being important to people doesn't add or remove any time to my life, nor any impact to the relationships I have which do have reciprocal importance/care. 

Statistically, it's been the same exact scenario for the vast majority of humans, and I have it a hell of a lot better than a good portion of them. 

I don't know whom I may grow a relationship with which will foster mutual care and importance. 

Everyone else is likely thinking the same thing. There have been billions and billions of people, all with roughly the same sort of thoughts and ideas in their head. No thought or worry any of us have is very likely to be unique at all. 

I can still build a life that means something *to me*. Find a passion and pursue it. Most people love passionate people, so, if being cared for is something you feel you need, being you, and strongly, is a great way to help foster that.",0

I’d be honoured I touched someone’s heart enough to have them be sad about it but I wouldn’t want them to be ripped apart. 

If I make a big enough impact in someone’s life that they remember me every once in a while after I’m gone, that’s good enough for me.",0

859,"Embrace these feelings, it can only serve to make you a more well rounded individual. Understanding and accepting that you are infinitely small makes all of your lives, passions, relationships, and desires infinitely more important, because of the ephemeral nature of it all. Eat the cheesecake, pet the dog, kiss your SO, because we are small, but that’s okay. Beyond that, worrying about who would and wouldn’t care if you were gone is futile, because when the time comes I am certain, within human understanding, that you will no longer care about who thinks what and why. Chin up, pal.",0
860,"I used to think like this, sometimes maybe I still do. But I learned that you have to put yourself out there, you have to ask yourself, do you care as much about the others as you want for yourself? If yes, finding people like that can be difficult, but it comes back to what do you provide for them? The laughs, the moments, the hangouts, the invites, do y'all have a good time together, connect?

I needed to find a way that helped me shift my focus from instead of caring about people's health so much for example, I should shift it to enjoying my time with myself and others as much as possible whenever. It changed my perspective and made me happy overall.

A part of me shares that even if I do die and they don't remember me, that's okay. We have so much going on in our lives and the number one thing people will remember is how much you made them smile or laugh and the good moments you enjoyed together. Bonus if you did activities together like skiing or art classes, if you do hobbies together it's very likely they'll continue it after you've passed. And being human, the activity would help them remember you, hopefully bringing cheer every time they ski or draw.",0
861,"I mean, the fact I don't mean much is a very freeing thought. I don't have to worry that when I die, many people will be overly sad. At the sane time, it means that in my life, I can do things without worrying about posterity. 

I am an insignificant speck adrift within an indifferent universe. Any feeling of existential dread is pointless, as it won't change reality, so i might as well enjoy life.",0

863,"I partially agree with you. Last September, my girlfriend passed away. We both lived together as foreigners, and we both have different nationalities. As far as I know, just her close family got sad about this event, and probably not of her friends is nothing her disappearance. In my case, I deeply feel her loss, and it hadn't passed a day I don't think of her. 

Steven Pinker in his book ""Better Angels of Our Nature"" says, death tolls are just numbers, namely when you speak about WWI and WWII, +40M and +85M, respectively. It is difficult for us as humans to process such a big number of casualties. For the same reason, when you see a documentary explaining that something terrible happened to hundreds or thousands of people, they just develop an individual case, then they extrapolate the problem.

In my case, I know very few people will care if I die, and definitely, the show must go on, but quite sure there will be one or two that would perceive the void that your departure left. Honestly, I can live with that.

In the Nausea for Jean-Paul Sartre, the protagonist manage to overcome the fear of losing his existence in a process of writing a book because he knew that people will remember him thanks to his work. I'm far from creating a work of meaningful value, I just try to make the life of my acquaintance no so miserable. Just remember as Bob Marley said: "" Don't live to make your presence noticed, live to make your absence felt. """,0
864,"Counterbalance that with cherishing the people who ***do*** care about you. There's nothing wrong with having one or two really close friends and a thousand acquaintances. Life is how you make it out to be; if you don't like the idea that *everyone* you're around is just ""passing by,"" then go out of your way to slowly build up relationships with people. Coworkers, preexisting friends, family, etc.

&#x200B;

>I can usually understand people to the point where they sometimes ask me how I can read their minds, but I've never felt understood myself 

This is a great trait to have, but it definitely comes with its drawbacks; not feeling like you're getting the same respect or attention or care as you're giving out is very common with people who go above and beyond the average person, so don't feel alone.

I regularly go out of my way to help others in my community, and I ***used*** to regularly get pretty annoyed at the amount of people who didn't do the same for me. It wasn't until I grew up a bit (not sure how old you are) that I realized ***most people suck***. Obviously it's not as black and white or as harsh as that, but the average person is just that - average. *Most* people aren't going to go out of their way to help someone, and *most* people aren't going to try to build up strong relationships, as there is time, effort and risk involved in that.

I genuinely feel like a beneficial member of my community regardless of if people recognize my involvement or not, or if they reciprocate with similar emotions or actions. If someone says to you it seems like you're *reading their mind*, take that as a seriously nice compliment and move on. Don't expect the same from them. Communication isn't a strong point with most people, so the fact that someone has told you it seems like you're reading your mind is their way of saying ""thanks for understanding me,"" even if it doesn't feel like they're really saying that.

My best advice is to not expect anything. Don't expect people to act a certain way. Don't expect people to appreciate things you do. Don't expect people to do anything *for* or *with* you. Because when someone *does* do any of these things, that will be a person you can get closer with.

The people who you interact with *do* care about you (maybe not in the exact way you *expect* they care about you), but by little comments they make, they're acknowledging something positive you've done for them, which in my opinion is more than enough to feel cared for in a community.",0
865,"> the majority of people who I know personally wouldn't really care if I disappeared or passed away.

That doesn't sound true.

In between ""friend"" and ""person I saw at the grocery store once"", I have many acquaintances and coworkers who, if they died, I would be saddened.

I miss people from my childhood who are probably still alive. I miss coworkers who quit or were fired years ago.",0
866,"I once worked with a guy. I wouldn't really call us close friends, or anything more than acquaintances at any point that I knew him for. We would talk every now and then, he seemed like a decent guy. One day he stopped coming to work because he relapsed on heroin. About a week later he was found in his car, dead. I knew him for less than a year, I never met any of his family, any girlfriends or anything he might have had. I never knew what he really wanted from life, or just how much he was struggling with his addiction. But I will never forget him, for the rest of my life.

One day I'm going to die too. I'm gonna stop being part of my friends and families lives, they'll be sad for a while, then they'll get over it, eventually they'll live their lives like I never existed, and one day, I'll be completely forgotten. This is a good thing, it isn't right for me to weigh on other people's minds long after I'm dead and gone, it isn't my place to be a burden on others' thoughts at that point. When I die, I will tell those around me not to be sad for my passing, after all it won't matter to me, but to instead be happy for the life I've lived. OP I think you want to know that your life has meaning, and the only way that it can have meaning for you is for you to make your own life meaningful. Build something, be a creator, get involved in a charity, do something that you see as inherently valuable with your life, and then in the end it won't matter whether you are remembered or cared for by those around you, you'll have lived a good life in your own terms, and that's all anyone can really hope for.",0
867,"Maybe it would help to see some perspective from a female view. Because I suspect it may be a problem of inherent worth (because I don't care that most people don't care, but I don't think it effects my worth). And it's about maternity/paternity but I think it's relative to the worth people put into guys.  

I am pregnant and have joined a lot of groups for information they might have. And I am increasingly frustrated by the over inflation of ""women need to lift each other up"" and ""mums this"" and ""mums that"" and a lack of... well anything FOR dads or representative of dads. It pisses me off. There are so many people who do a great job of being a parent but they're treated like they just make money and nothing else. So many trashy posts come through Instagram pages for example, where they ""jokingly"" bitch about men. But it's ALL about how women are super heroes... *eyeroll*  

It's fine to have a place to have meaningful conversation and support but not when it's so one sided.  

I guess my point is that on a human level, it might seem like masculine appreciation is downplayed or non existent, but there are more people out there who do inherently appreciate you than you think they would, because that's normal and they think of it as an expected world view.",0
868,"The problem is that you are only half right. Will the world forget you eventually? Yes. In the 50ish years after you die? Of course not. Your kids and grand kids will definitely remember you, although they may not think of you every minute.  I share a passing though for my dad nearly every day and it's been over a decade. Don't mistake people's ability to function through loss for forgetfulness. They just can't spend their lives grieving.  Those that love you won't forget you. Close friends will drink to the good times several times a year, kids will cherish that old blanket you gave them, significant others will keep the ring on a shelf and you in their hearts.  You won't be forgotten until the people you truely hope will remember you are joining you up above.",0

870,"Yes! It's not malicious indifference! it'I just indifference. Most people in general are positive about others, so for example if they'd heard that someone they knew passed away, they'd still be sad about, but it just might not be for long. So slightly positive indifference? :D",0

887,"Hey dude,

First of all, so sorry for your loss of your loved ones. It's hard as heck. 

I lost my 10 year old cat in December due to cancer and I had to put down my 1 year old car yesterday due to a neurological disorder that affected everything in her system this past month. 

The way I dealt with them passing:

1. Cried
2. Cried a lot
3. Watched videos and pictures of them to make me smile
4. After smiling, cried again
5. Told friends and family so they could be understanding during that time 
6. Ate comfort food
7. Made cremation appointments
8. More importantly, made (will make for the little one soon) keepsakes that can hold some of their ashes
9. Remember them and always talk about them, even when it's hard
10. Watched more videos and pictures of them. 

It's never easy when they pass. It's even less easy when you try to look for them and then remember that they're gone. 

But the thing that you have to remember is that you gave them a good life. Lots of love, cuddles, treats and endless kisses. Unfortunately, as someone else said in the thread, they're not here for our whole lifetime, but we are here for theirs. 

Hope this helps and take care of yourself.",0

As my muzzle is greying

My eyesight fading

And my body weakening

I understand

Before I go to rest

Please grant me

One last request:

When I can no longer eat

When I can no longer sleep

When even your loving tough

Starts hurting too much

Please let me go

And set me free.

 

When I am ready

To take that last journey

Stay with me until I’m free.

Say a prayer to give me peace

Stroke my body to bring me ease

Hold my paw to give me strength

Kiss my face to show me love

Close my eyes to let me sleep …

Assure me that you’ll be ok

Whisper my name

To guide me on my way.

 

And Mom, Dad

Please, please don’t cry

Know that you have given me

A wonderful, wonderful life.

889,"Grief is simply the love you still have to offer that animal that's no longer here physically. Grief hurts for sure, but nothing is stopping you from expressing that love you still have. Cry It out, talk to them like they are still here. Express that energy so it can make it's way back to them to receive.
I lost my best friend 5 years ago and I STILL cry for him. Even with another pup who I love with all my heart, I still cry out for my lost baby. THAT is how much love I still have for my childhood dog. My Avalanche was with me from 11yo to 27yo. He was with me thru literally everything. So why wouldn't I cry out for the coolest dog in my world? 

If you have love for another living being and you have the ability to offer them a safe home for them to grow in, then you need to recognize the love they have for you. You need to recognize how incredible you truly are to allow these other species to exist freely with you. For an animal to die near a human isn't normal for them. They only die in places they feel safe. So your animals passing away WITH you means they literally trusted and loved you so much that even in death they wanted to be near you. 

Grief comes with love.
You love these babies and they are showing you that even as they die, they love you the most. I think you're doing great and if you truly want to love these babies, you'll find your way to your next adorable furbaby. 💓💔💓",0
890,"In my experience, the pain and loss forever stays the same and hurts the same no matter how much time has passed. However, time absolutely does heal. The pain comes sharp and fast at first and nearly unbearable, then not quite as often, and after a while you'll realize that a quite a long time passes between memories and sadness. You then know your gratitute for your time together outweighs the pain of losing them. Then, oh then...a new friend can come in and you fall in love again, and you remember why these relationships are so amazing and important and why we love and lose our family time and again willingly. We are only here for a short while. Love while you're here, because we can't love like this in these bodies anywhere else.

Just because we lose the physical part of those we love, doesn't mean they're gone, and it doesn't mean loving isn't worth it. It's everything.",0

I know when it's time for my golden retriever Billy to go to the rainbow bridge it will break me and I'll be unconsolable and grieving for a long time. Even thinking about it now is making me tear up.

Know you gave them the best life you could, that animal loved you and was comforted by you and your presence so much they felt they could trust you and sleep by you. 

When they pass on, a part of you which you dedicated to them passes on too. But it's your duty to remember all the quality memories you have of your beloved pets, every moment you came home to see them jumping for joy, meowing or boofing their fluffy hearts out as you come through the door, keys in hand from a hard days work. Every cold miserable day where you woken up to them by your side in bed, to have them lick your face and or hands relentlessly, to have them drooling on your lap as you eat and share a cheeseburger with them.

They love you just as much as you love them.

This is also a part of what life is, loving, losing, and learning to love again.

I try not to replace them right away as some sort of respect to how much they meant to me. And I never get the same breed on the next one either. I do not want to diminish how much ol sparky meant to me by getting a clone. But I know people who do that and it helps them cope. Just keep in mind that you gave  them the best life. They experienced true love from you. You both were always there for each other and they will always be remembered. Yes it hurts but it’s life.,0
907,"It feels like losing a family member because you are losing a family member, the animals we choose to spend our lives with can be just as important to us as people. I work at a equine rescue ranch and sometimes we get animals in that have conditions they simply cant recover from and years later they will pass away and its always very very hard. How i get through losing animals is first; mourning. Its important to feel that grief but not let it consume you. Know that the animal you had lived whatever part of its life it had with you feeling loved, cared for and protected. Your cat sounds like it had an amazing and loving home that they wouldnt have traded for anything and even though they arent here anymore the memories and love is still there. Its also important to know that getting another animal dosnt have to be “replacing” another, i would highly recommend rescuing the next animal you get. Knowing you gave them a second chance at life and knowing they lived the best life possible once you got them is what gets me through losing my animals from dogs to horses.",0
908,You are focused on the wrong thing. I am a grown man who rarely cries. I bawled when a had to put down my Shadow. But the truth is we saved each other I gave him a warm loving home when he was returned 3 times from the shelter I got him. He gave me love and companionship I will take with me the rest of my life.  Save a pets life by adopting from a shelter. the pain you feel when they pass is nothing compared to the joy in sharing their life.,0
909,My pets are the only children I will ever have. When they pass away it is brutally painful for me but I know that I gave them the best life possible and they loved me as much as I loved them. Doesn’t stop me from getting another furball in need of love later.,0
910,"My wife (with my support) created a shrine to our lost dog (I only knew her for a year-ish but she had her for ~10 years... passing at nearly 13.5yo) She was one of the first dogs I loved and even at 13 was like a kid knocking over stuff all around the house. Your sentiment is very accurate. The phrase ""time heals all wounds"" doesn't have a duration so... it wasn't a night or two ago where my wife broke into tears about the loss that was a month or more ago. I'd gladly give you a hug  and a shoulder to cry on if we were actually face-to-face.

I don't have additional  specific advice but to relate it to humans (e.g. relatives) sometimes you have to cry yourself to sleep many times until you've exhausted yourself so you can move on.",0
911,"Grief is natural. All that love you had for them unfortunately hurts. I lost my childhood pet nearly a decade ago and I still miss him like crazy. Myself and my partner lost our cat about 7 months ago and I still get mixed up because I sometimes hear his gentle meows. It will hurt I'm afraid and always will, that is the price of love. 

The thing that keeps me going is, to have had them in my life as I did I will hold the burden because I gave them the best life I could and they gave me the best they could and to have had them is better to have not.

Edit; I should clarify, lost as in they passed away.",0
912,"I'm having nearly the exact experience as you, OP. This Friday will mark one year from the date I had to say goodbye to my big orange cat George, who was just a month shy of his 13th birthday. He was diabetic but well-controlled and otherwise healthy, but one Monday morning I awoke to him seizing on the living room floor. He passed away at the clinic three days later. My vet thinks George somehow ingested some sort of rodenticide.

With this dark anniversary just around the corner, a lot of the grief and sadness has come flooding back. I still weep from time to time about losing him, especially so suddenly. I'd had him since he was just 7 weeks old. He was with me through graduate school, a long and frustrating job search, and so many other rough patches. I know I'll never not think about or miss him. I know with time the pain will ease, but I doubt it will ever be completely gone. I guess that's just the inevitable consequence of opening my heart to him and loving him for all the wonderful years I did have with him.

Take care, man.",0
913,"My family has had 4 dogs in the home through out our lives. 3 have passed, while the 4th one is still very young. It sucks everytime when they pass, but the 13+ years of joy and love from those precious little fur balls is worth it every time.",0
914,"I don't like to say ""deal with"" like grief is the dishes I'm too big a man to be bothered to do. ""How do I mourn my best friend"" is like, the oldest question we have. The best advice I can give is to let yourself grieve, let yourself cry and feel miserable. There's no way to bypass grief.  **There is no way to bypass grief**. **Take care of yourself while you grieve.** Keep showering and getting dressed in the morning like today is important. Eat good food and make time with your friends. Play, and if you have a partner be a good partner back. As long as there has every been anything, and everything that has ever been, has ended or will end. The only thing you can do is savor them while it's here- and while you're here. It sounds like you really did that with yours. Keep saying goodbye, it's like a cold. There isn't a medicine for it, you just have to treat the symptoms and take better care of yourself while you go through it. When you're ready, if having pets is something you love, there are other animals waiting to be loved the way you loved yours.",0
915,"The joy they bring day in and day out for (hopefully)years is worth it. In my opinion. It's fucking hard when they go, I had to put 3 down in one year. But time is a good healer and I've found the time it takes to move on from their passing is much less than the time you're with them.",0
916,"Most animals don’t live as long as us. That’s just a fact of anything. One day my cats are going to pass away, and I can’t do anything about that. I don’t think I’m sad about it though. The animals we let into our homes live their full lives and die peacefully. Caring for them during that time is something that gives me great meaning. I guess my message would be complete acceptance of what is. The sadness will come. We have no control over that. It can come from any part of our lives at any time. Trying to control when and where it comes from will only increase it.",0
917,"when my 12 year old bird passed away I didn't got sad neither grieved, death is also part of life so I just buried it and moved on like nothing happened. I don't know it's probably because I'm heartless I never get sad over death or things I cannot change",0

Got a new dog only 5 years after he passed away, still couldn't call my new dogs the same nickname I gave him. I still talk to him, saying he's still my best buddy and I miss him terribly. I still am afraid to look at the few pictures I got him when he was still with me.

Some ppl think that's too much, but I too, grieve hard.",0
922,"Agreed. It’s totally ok to grieve for our pets. They are part of the family. 

My 13 year old dog passed away last year and i cried for days. Took a small gateway vacation and then got a kitty about 2 months after. Fell in love. She suddenly passed away last month and I cried for a week straight (she wasn’t the healthiest cat to begin with though). Time helps.

I definitely understand the feeling of wanting a pet, but also scared because you just had someone so dear to you and don’t want to replace them. And you don’t. You just provide a loving home to another animal. I’m taking some time before getting another animal though.",0
923,"Parrots leave a particular wound on your soul in my opinion. They’re just ... unique. Kind of like how no 2 humans are the same no matter how similar they are. Parrots have these eccentricities and quirks that just feel irreplaceable.

Another baby parrotlet I had died unexpectedly after only 2 weeks but our bond was strong enough to have me in grief for weeks. Birds are immensely beautiful creatures, they really leave a mark on your heart and I feel your pain ❤️",0

With me and my pets, i would talk to them (they would meow back or bark back. To tell what they said, soft tone = want, loud tone = excited.

The next day she passed away. She was trying to tell me that she was not gonna live much longer. And that, to me, just because they can’t communicate, doesn’t mean they are robots. They just need to be discovered and treated, similar to how a hurt human can be blossomed into a blooming flower.",0

929,"Depends. If you’re in the passing lane you need to move over. If you’re in the right lane do nothing. If I’m cruising around town on a small two lane road doing the speed limit or 5 over I get petty and just downshift and keep slowing down until they back off or pass lol

Btw as a side note, as a driver in the US, no one (and apparently a few in this thread) knows how to use lanes correctly. The left lane isn’t a “fast lane” it is a PASSING lane. After you pass a car move the fuck back over so faster traffic can pass you. In my state riding in the left lane is a traffic violation, although apparently rarely enforced lol",0

I actually let everybody else pass me on purpose sometimes I even pull over to let them pass but the freedom of not being at the front of the pack is unbelievably liberating.

Try it sometime, you may never go back to driving fast.",0
932,"Last night I had some goon tailgating me. He was so close my back-up sensor alarms were going off. We pulled away from a red light and he maintained about a foot of distance between him and I for a quarter mile while we be were accelerating/cruising. I pulled over to let him pass.

When I pulled over, someone was turning onto the roadway ahead of me and didn't expect some idiot to come flying around me and they ended up cutting him off. He then tailgated them up to about 10mph over the limit.

Just let them pass if you safely can. It isn't worth the stress headache you get from being angry combined with staring into your rear-view.",0
933,"I tailgate people (confession time). It has nothing to do with roadrage 99.995% of the time. It's because there is open road ahead, and they are preventing me from reaching it. But most of the time they are a. camping in the left lane, b. running neck and neck with another car making it impossible to pass, or c. going slower than the reasonable flow of traffic. I don't care how fast you want to go, just as long as you're not obstructing my path. On the flip side, I rarely get tailgated any more. That's because I am a. constantly watching my mirrors, especially the rearview, b. aware of gaps in the road and get over to fill them, and c. running with the fastest traffic. If someone is tailgating me, it is typically impossible for them to pass or go faster regardless of what they do because I am going as fast as that moment allows. A final thing, at least with my vehicle, is curves. Nothing brings me greater joy than watching someone who was tailgating me fall back because they can't hang with me. If I don't feel like getting over, I'll just outdrive them.",0
934,If its a normal road 55 under if im doing five over ill gradually slow to the exact limit and ill let em pass me if they want to if im on the interstate 60 up ill move over so they can pass me.,0
935,"I get out of the way, if I can't, I tap the brakes a couple times so the lights light up without me slowing down to let them know that I don't like that. If they don't respond then I will gradually slow down to make it easier for them to pass. I did call the police on an officer who was doing it to me for about 10 miles. He could have safely passed sooooo many times! I really wanted to jam the brakes on but I would never do that because I'm not going to let my anger crash a car. This is probably going to piss a lot of people off and I don't do it anymore..... But I learned to drive as a very stoned teenager and I've always followed the traffic laws as strictly as I could to avoid any attention so I can just get where I was going and not crash or get pulled over. When I hear people talking about being badasses on the road I point out that the whole point of driving is to get where you're going ""Why would you mess with someone in any way""",0
936,That pisses me off so bad lol. I normally start slowing way way down until it forces them to pass. One time I got all the way down to 30 in a 55 before the guy passed me lol.,0
937,"I usually just hit the brakes,  I couldn't give a fuck if they hit me. In my country, you're automatically at fault if you hit someone in the rear and my cars a company vehicle so they'll just get me another one. Funny enough, never been hit, but I've caused two tailgaters to crash by doing this, and another who had failed to strap her kids in had them all hurtle into the front with her. The last one was a cunt with two dolled up blondes in an Audi 4×4. His wagon was a few years old but he thought he was the dogs bollocks and was really doing his best to impress these women, flashing the lights etc. I could see the women laughing and he looking all smug. Well I done my thing, suddenly the 3 of them looked horrified as he stood on his brakes. The lassie in the back had been between the seats, so she came flying into the front. He swerved about me as I took off again and as I pulled away he done a mad fishtail and almost flipped. It was very enjoyable. Fuck them. 

By the way ordinarily I do let them pass, but the really aggressive ones? Nah, they get the brakes.",0

939,"This can definitely be stressful.  I typically ensure I'm in the non-passing lane and then simply flick on cruise control so I don't find myself unconsciously going faster.  Eventually if they are consciously tailgating they'll realize they'll need to pass you if they want to go faster -- problem solved.  OR, they actually didn't realize they were tailgating you, that's just what they perceive to be a normal following distance.  Ergo, they're not actually tailgating you they're just not great drivers -- problem solved.",0

944,"Mixed.

It won't be a popular opinion but they do better at some roles then others. 

When I was in the CF they had a physical test for the men and a different one for the women (not sure if its still like this), this was for people all doing the same job. In terms of front line combat roles if they can pass the same physical tests as the men I have no issue with it though. But giving certain people a free pass on standards just puts the lives of everyone else in the unit in danger. 

I also saw some of them get a free pass in other areas like weapons handling drills and marksmanship, that absolutely will get people killed. I assume this was because the higher ups were afraid to rock the boat given their gender but I can't say that for certain. I just know the NCO's would look frustrated repeating drills with them over and over but would pass them regardless. For context this was somewhere around 15 years ago.

If they pass the same identical standards as men with no slack at all, no problem. If not the military needs to be able to wash them out like anyone else. Also for pilots and stuff like that I have no issue at all.",0
945,"I don't understand why women-only combat units haven't even been proposed.

I guess (US perspective here) ""separate but equal"" has nasty historical connotations, but in sports we segregate the sexes and few people any beef with that.  And if any human endeavor mimics sports, it's war (actually I guess it's sports that mimic war...).

All-women units would eliminate at a stroke most of the complaints and dire predictions of those who advocate against women in combat.  You won't have to worry about men being chivalrous and making bad decisions to protect female soldiers.  Nobody can get pregnant.  If they have to rescue each other, they are closer to the same size.  The training can be optimized to women's physiology to prevent stress injuries.  Their gear loadout can be similarly optimized for their weight-carrying capacity (I wouldn't be surprised if they figure out a different weight distribution across the body works better for women's bodies).

History has ample examples of all-women fighting units kicking ass and taking names.  Are there people back home expecting them to fail?  Good!  It will only drive them to train and fight harder to prove the bigots wrong.  When they succeed, nobody can say the men did it despite being burdened by the women - there can be no doubt it was all the women who did that shit.  If they are fighting an enemy who can't be trusted to treat prisoners decently, women have an extra layer of concerns about being taken prisoner.  Against that enemy, watch them fight like demons from hell to win.

I'm skeptical about integrated combat units, because that's experimental and I don't like the idea of playing games with people's lives when they are already volunteering to go into danger.  All-women units, however, I don't have a problem with it.  Because although it's somewhat experimental, it would be an experiment that everyone involved will have volunteered to be a part of.  And the fact that they have something to prove is likely to make them more effective, not less.

And all-women units could be a proving ground for women in combat, and that could be a good stepping-stone to integrated units, if anyone still wants them.",0
946,Whatever happened to the 2(?) Women who passed Ranger school? Did they ever see combat? And if so did they kick ass?,0
947,"From my experiences its about an 80/20 split. 20% of women I worked with when i was in the military were fine, they had no problem showing up, doing their job, and generally pulled their own weight.

A child with a gun can kill just as easily as a woman or man. If they're grown ass adults and can pass the physical tests then there's no reason for the discrimination.",0
949,"The Israelis had it right decades ago. Servicewomen must be present in combat in women-only platoons, and never in front line duty. Women can fulfill a useful role as auxiliaries holding positions on targets already secured, or as REMFs. They can also serve in any role by air or by sea where they can pass the same strict examination as men. 

A less strenuous PT requirement would then be permissible, as it already is for a lot of armed forces. 

What's I've noticed is that in cultures with a longer history of volunteer-only standing forces, like in Anglo countries, there is a fixation feminists have on esprit de corps, because military institutions are the single example of masculinity where no woman can enter without spoiling the whole institution. Yet the pageantry and cult of valour is too irresistible. Hence why the more recent schism in sexual politics has been to neuter everything.",0
950,"I think the concern is the military may give them a free pass in certain areas to meet certain quota standards and be afraid to wash them out due to potential political backlash. This actually happened in the Canadian Forces.

If that happens its not doing anyone any favors including the women enlisting since they are not meeting certain standards which were set for a reason. And the consequences for not meeting them can be rather dire during an actual conflict.

But yes if the pass or fail on the same standards as everyone else I have absolutely no issue.",0
951,"Why not just create a two tiered system - one with the current or higher pt requirements, and another with lower requirements for non combat roles?  Anyone can join either force,  but they simply must meet the requirement.  That way there's no weakening of standards, and you may even get more recruits passing the tests due to more people being able to pass the lower standard.",0
952,"Well ours have been passing with the same requirements for half a century now. Looks like it only turns into an issue if the military is sexist in its training, which defeats the entire purpose of training them like you said.",0
953,"That's effectively how virtually all modern militaries already operate. It leads to resentment because lower requirements still doesn't get enough extra female recruits, yet there are very sensible reasons for keeping them in separate quarters. There also isn't a twin rank structure, which would be self-defeating, so a lot of men I used to work with absolutely detested women NCOs and junior officers, and they more often than not were promoted just to look good on paper for all the civil servants to pass on in a memo to the secretary of defense. It harms the integrity of the whole force, but politics doesn't care. 

Now if we did have a Starship Troopers scenario of co-ed facilities and higher requirements to entry that most men couldn't even pass, that at least gave recruits enough emotional support and opportunities to return to civilian life without any societal guilt, then we'd be onto something.",0
954,"I agree with you. My only counter thought is doesn’t it come down to the military chain of command? 

You have rankings in every platoon/division. Hypothetically if your front line/high ranking guys who passed the more strenuous PT tests all get taken out, and you’re in a lower level (even as admin or whatever) you’re the next highest rank until support comes. You then have to lead those below you. While you have a PT assessment to pass, it’s not to the level your higher ranking have to meet. I wonder, could that PT differentiation end up being very important in an extreme situation?",0
955,"Service members have a natural instinct to protect eachother. Regardless of race, color, creed, gender, waist size, preference of coffee color, etc. 

The idea that a leader will throw down his life because ""she's a woman"" over throwing down his life for some other squad mate is an asinine and childish view that only someone who hasn't ever had to lead a combat unit would argue. 

And believe it or not, there are plenty of men who don't make it through basic infsntry training as well. Plenty of 5'2 110lbs can't-hack-its who sign up for the infantry only to suffer skeletal injuries or the inability to buddy drag their 200lb squad made. 

The physical standards are there to weed out anybody who can't handle it, male or female. So as long as we don't move the physical fitness standards, I say we let em all in and whoever passes gets to join, regardless of gender.",0
956,"I am not obfuscating their role. Because of the actual history behind it I just do not want to use Soviet WW2 recruiting standards as a template.

If women can meet exactly the same standards on a pass or fail test that the men can I have no issue with it. If they can't pass the same tests then they don't belong there same as any men who would fail.",0
957,"I get what you're saying, and you have a really valid point about the almost erasure of gender roles in our society today. 

However, what I am saying is that the role of attraction or love between a male and female impacting combat readiness, would probably be a lot lower than we think. I think this for two reasons;
1) If sexual attraction was a key factor, we would see units be adversely affected by having gay service members. If you argue against having women in combat arms for the sake of 'romance' (we can call it that to keep it simple) then shouldn't we also be worried about same sex romance impacting the unit? - this is a wild stab here, but I imagine the percentage of women that could pass the physical screening would be similar to the amount of gay men who are already in these units, pretty low -

So I think we are over selling that point or the argument. 

2) PTSD is a significant cause of veteran suicide, and a leading cause of PTSD is the ""learning about the violent or accidental death of a loved one"". ([this was hasty Google research, don't hate](http://Learning about the violent or accidental death or injury of a loved

Read more: https://militarybenefits.info/ptsd/#ixzz6nak7Ut2S)

Based off of that, we can see that the amount of love servicemembers have for eachother is staggering, so much so that they literally kill themselves over losing one another. How many men do you know that kill themselves because they lost a spouse or girlfriend?  About 1% ([again, more hasty research, I'm on my phone so...])(https://consumer.healthday.com/mental-health-information-25/depression-news-176/young-widowers-at-high-suicide-risk-509039.html) veterans commit suicide due to PTSD at a much higher rate than that. 

So I think we are downplaying the amount of love service members already have for eschother. 


Tldr: inter-service relations matter way less than we think, and the bond between servicemembers already matters way more than we think.

But I can pass to you what I’ve learnt from my experience so far.

Ps: My father was absent for the most part of my life so far we picked back up our relationship when I was already “formed” for lack of a better word.

• Never take out a loan against anything that’s not a “investment”, for example taking out a car loan for an A to B car is fine as it will allow you to get to work and earn more in the long run but I actually worked with a guy who thought it was okay to take a loan out to go on a holiday and buy a new PlayStation.

• Learn basic nutrition, do your check ups with the doctor or see a nutritionist your health is your wealth and no investment spent on it is useless, I found out I have a genetic iron processing disorder through this, which would’ve caused trouble in my older years.

• Learn some basic philosophy, it’s a good cure for Nihilism which is the dominant thought at the moment. Nietzsche lived a mediocre pessimistic life but he’s a good read to understand the prevailing subconscious of western society. 

• Learn basic politics read the communist manifesto, Moustache guy politics and free market liberalism should have you 90% more equipped than most of reddit.

• Understand the hidden sub context in life , “Why does he want me to do this?”  this is a good skill that’s kept me out of trouble, and it’s like a knife you sharpen I’m not saying be paranoid but hone your intuition.

• Pay notice to people’s body language, I worked in meat grinder sales for 1.5 years.

A smile ear to ear without movement in the eyes is usually coming from a Machiavellian motivation, genuine smiles and laughter engages the eyes and you would see more teeth.

People turn their feet towards the people they like or trust most, and easy way to make someone comfortable is to look them up from the feet to the head.

The first one to speak always loses in a negotiation.

In an interview back straight with your hands on each thigh or closed fist together with wide legs.

Look people in the eye and look away every few seconds so they don’t think your a psycho.

• Never give a bad handshake.

• Cliche, but don’t be a consumer, hold on to things for as long as you can and enjoy things you used to have don’t always move to the next product iPhones for example I’ve been an Apple user for 4 years I’ve only had 2 iPhones and they release one every year or quarter I have a 7 and I think we are on 11. I have  pairs of trainers a few times and then use them as gym/running shoes before tossing them, only toss a trainer that has holes in it you paid $50+ for them.

• Watch what you say in 2020 the thought police is out in full force and they are undercover and patrolling constantly , I can’t even make jokes which I usually do in my writing because this would be removed I’ve banned from more subreddits than I can count for lewd language don’t be me. **More Importantly** *you can’t go in to work with toilet talk anymore or you are asking for a 1 way ticket to the HR office.*

• Don’t do class A drugs, no excuse.

• Limit alcohol consumption, your asking for nutrient deficiency’s, low testosterone and a small wallet. Alcohol isn’t manly it’s “consoomer”

• Be careful of the modern “energy vampires” which are E-Thots, Porn, gaming, social media, advertisers, salesmen, politicians, modern religions they all want 5 minutes of your time and your money you don’t need them no matter how much they spiel on about benefits.

• Find a hobby and get good at it.

• Do a basic fitness test if you can’t run 4K and do 10 push-ups you are very unfit, start by running and or going to the gym.

• Caffeine is a false economy it makes you worse over time and most people drink to much, it depletes nutrients and a large percentage of people are genetically sensitive. Sleep and water are better energy alternatives.

• Be an asshole with money, it’s yours and unless someone really needs it hand it out, remember that father I mentioned? I ended up paying a lot for him and realised this rule the hard way. Now I’m Mr.Krabs incarnate.

• Learn basic maintenance, how to use a hammer, screwdriver, drill etc.. and the safety behind it I once seen guys welding without using a visor because he thought squinting would work, ever get welders flash?

• If you take on any job spread out let them know how much knowledge you have in different areas “diversify” you are more employable in a recession, during lay offs etc.. but as a counter point don’t be a corporate slave respect yourself.

• Understand hierarchy’s and how to Identify who’s in charge and who thinks they are,  very important rule.

• If you want to know anything read a book on it, YouTube videos and Articles are usually far away from the actual theory/advice/knowledge and you are reading from 3rd person. Chinese whispers and that.

Their high points and how awesome you felt about them when they got that science award, or won at soccer...or hell, my son blocked the ball with his chest on purpose and he is six. That moment I saw him make the decision  to take that flying shot to the chest and leap forward eyes closed, fists flailing backward instead of cringing into a ball...was a moment where I am proud of him. Proud of him for taking a little pain for the prize. I asked him afterwards if it hurt. And he said ""yes, but it was the right thing to do

Don’t let the men in your life govern how you live/what you do with your time. Do what YOU want to do, not what makes them happy. If they love and respect you, they should want you to pursue your ambitions in your own way.
Your mom, if you have a good relationship, can be your best friend and closest ally.
Your 20s are about field testing everything you’ve learned about life so far. Use them to seek and experiment with whatever life you think you will enjoy. Expect some failure. It’ll suck, but it’s important to learn what doesn’t work. The more research you do ahead of time, the more catastrophic failure you can avoid.
Go to the dentist regularly. If you eat well and have good family health history you can probably skip a few check ups with your GP, but don’t skimp on the dentist.

I was always interested in art. Coming from a solidly blue collar family, most folks would think it hard to get encouragement.. but I got a ton.

My dad said ‘if you truly love what you do, you’ll feel as though you won the lottery...
And you’ll spend more hours at your job then you will with your family, so for gods sake don’t waste it on something you are indifferent about...
You have a talent, so look at the world of art, design etc... and think... where can I make the biggest and best contribution... where can I fit in...Don’t try and chase the money... money will be the by product of your passion and hard work... so make the work the priority.

My dad (retired now) was an electrician... and he LOVED being an electrician... so he wanted me to have that same feeling...

Best. Dad. Ever.",0
991,"I lost both of my parents when I was in my very early 20s. Was closer to my father by a long shot than my mother but it wasn't by much.

I try to think back to what I honestly learned from them. To be honest the time for the things you truly learn, good and bad, and have them shape you has probably long passed. 

Still I'll try with some things I learned from my father.


Always make sure when driving that you never stop your vehicle so close to the vehicle infront of you that you can't see their back tires. This gives you room to get out if you need to.

Always keep a panty of foodstuffs you use the most and things you can make a couple quick non perishable meals. For example if I use ketchup pretty often I keep a spare bottle in the pantry. Once I use the one I have in the fridge I open the new one and put it on the list. I also keep things like canned corn, rice, canned beans, canned mushrooms, just odds and ends for filling out meals or to whip something up fast when you've had a hard day and just need to eat. 

Hate is not the opposite of Love. Apathy is the opposite of Love. Never allow someone to have so much control over your emotions and you as to hate them. If you have hate for someone you need to self reflect and ask why they're so important to you. If you don't have a good answer it's time to let your hate and let them go.

The most important thing I learned from my father, which I cannot say without sounding cliche so I'm not going to try that hard, is to always remember we're all human. 

Our life in this world is extremely brief, don't let things like hate ruin the time you have. Do your best to empathize, treat each other not with ""respect"" but empathy. To really respect someone there's something about them you need to be able to connect with at some level. However even the people who have different political beliefs, religious beliefs, cultural beliefs or anything inbetween deserve your empathy too.

That's not to say you must subject yourself to toxicity, infact you need to be responsible for taking that out of your life. Still, this world would be a much better place if we could understand each other and genuinely want in our hearts for us all to live healthy and happy lives.

Good luck",0

Remember that you are a product of love. You don’t owe anyone anything and you’re OK the way you are. You are not defined by your successes or failures. You are a gift to this world. And so is everybody else. Give everyone a chance. 

Also, I believe there is no objective right or wrong that anyone can impose on you. Don’t ever let somebody else’s belief system override your conscience. And don’t do that to others either. 

Everything you do has consequences but they aren’t magically fair. You’ll never know the full picture. Don’t let bad luck make you stop believing and don’t let good luck make you haughty. Keep learning. 

Finally, there’s no magical perfect soulmate for you. Relationships are hard work. It’s up to you to decide who is worth your investment in them and what kind of investment. If you want to be alone, that’s ok too. You’re not defined by your mate. And they make their own choices. Sometimes you’ll do everything right and it still won’t work. Remember that your first relationship is with yourself. Invest in that one first and foremost.

Be careful with too much partying...some of the hard drugs can rewire your brain forever. Care about your health and cherish it. Don’t be so materialistic. Things don’t buy happiness. Rather spend your money on experiences with people you care about. Learn about investing and plan for retirement early even though it seems too far away. Tell the people you care about that you love them regularly because you never know when they will be gone. Don’t keep your eggs all in one basket as far as your career. Have backup plans and keep learning new skills. You never know when you will be laid off. Learn about philosophy and skepticism. You can never be too skeptical. Seek truth and avoid being scammed. And remember, the journey to a goal has to be more important. You can’t just be happy when you reach a goal. Learn to really enjoy the process because most of this life is the process. Enjoy every moment, even the failures. That’s how you learn and grow. I’m 35 now and I have learned all of this in the last 10 years. Good luck, wish you all the best :)",0

WHEN I play on my fiddle in Dooney,

My cousin is priest in Kilvarnet,   
My brother in Moharabuiee.   
   
I passed my brother and cousin:           
They read in their books of prayer;   
I read in my book of songs   
I bought at the Sligo fair.   
   
When we come at the end of time,   
To Peter sitting in state,    
He will smile on the three old spirits,   
But call me first through the gate;   
   
For the good are always the merry,   
Save by an evil chance,   
And the merry love the fiddle    
And the merry love to dance:   
   
And when the folk there spy me,   
They will all come up to me,   
With ‘Here is the fiddler of Dooney!’   
And dance like a wave of the sea.",0

My nieces and nephews are growing up now in the same poor town as me and I see them all misbehaving at school and they will leave with terrible grades go straight into minimum wage jobs and that will be there life. I try and get them to dream big but they don't realise they can do anything they set their mind too so they don't try, nobody expects anything else of them.

So I will say. You can do whatever you want to do in life within reason, dream big, do well in school because it will open up doors for you.

Even if the people around you don't have any expectations of you or aspirations of their own. You can do whatever you want to do with your life so think about what would make you the most happy then take steps to achieve it. 

Don't just settle for bare minimum. Try and reach your dreams even if it leads to failure sometimes as it also leads to success so never give up and find a way to fulfil your dreams.

And install exercise as a habit in your life as well as eating healthily.",0

1006,"Invest wisely. Save an emergency fund for you to live on for a while if you need to. When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time and act accordingly. Trust people but get receipts. Don't commit crimes, it's not a matter of if you will be caught, but when. Never talk down about anyone's family member or significant other, even if they do. Even if they act like it's ok, it will build resentment eventually. Take care of your health. Once it's damaged you usually can't get it back, and when you're healthy you can't fully appreciate this, but your health is everything. Without it everything else goes to shit in ways you can't imagine on many levels. Not everyone needs to be in your life, don't keep toxic people in it, but at the same time be careful burning bridges. Not everyone you dislike needs to know it, you never know when you might need someone's help. A lot, and I mean a lot of the time it's not what you know, it's who you know, so make connections.

 Invest wisely, especially investments that bring passive income, that bears repeating.",0

If something goes different than you wanted it doesnt mean it's over. Say ""good"" and move on. Didnt get that promotion? Good, now you have more time to better yourself. Didnt get the new hear you needed? Good, now you can learn to improvise and better your creative thinking skills. In every situation there is some good, you just have to find it


Never ask your subordinate to do something you would not or have not done yourself. Pretty self-explanatory. Dont just be the leader in the office, get out there and show your subordinates you are doing stuff too and that you are willing to work with them


Be a leader for the boys (or girls). Be there for your subordinates and make yourself available. This doesn't mean that you be a push-over, but also have a compassion for those you are leading. Shit happens, just be sure to be the leader you would want to have

1009,"Not a Dad, but this is the fatherly advice I received from the male role models in my life. 

Learn to budget your money. Being smart with your money no matter how much you bring in will always be important.

Don't settle but also don't be so quick to push away. Whether that's with a job, a friend, a partner. Always look at the whole situation, break down the good VS the bad, and when you want to run, give it a few days. 

Learn simple tasks, basic first aid, how to change a tire, how to recognise a potentially dangerous situation, how to use a paper map and compass. Things you may not always need but when you need them you really need them. 

This more so applies to being a young man (at least for me being male), but I feel applies to both sexes. Learn there is no wrong way to be a man (or woman). You don't have to be 6'2"" with big muscles and a gnarly beard. Meat headed gym nuts with shallow attitudes are only appealing for so long. Kindness is what counts. Apply that to being female however you feel suits you but its true.",0

I’m 28 so not too far off from you. And my father passed away 10 years ago, at that age I didn’t have a good understanding of budgeting so I learned the hard way. And the only way I actually did learn was thanks to my step father. 

It sounds simple but I will give you an example and use easy numbers to make it as easy to understand as possible. 

Let’s say your -

rent is $100. 
Cable $40. 
Phone $40. 
Car ins. $20.
Utilities $100

Total is $300

You take home $150 a week. $600/m with a 4 paycheck month (some months will be 5)

You need to put away $75 a week to pay all your monthly bills. As soon as you get paid every week take $75 and put it in the bill account and this way you will always have your bills paid. 

You want to save $10 a week just to save, take that as soon as you get paid and put it in your savings. 

Now you are left with $65 and that’s your anything money. Gas in the car, food, spending.

Really makes life easier when you know your bills are always paid.",0

1014,"When looking for a lifelong mate as in marriage please focus heavily on how they communicate their needs and wants. Communication is a central factor that can make or break relationships. After that talk openly about your expectations for sexual expression and fulfillment, of you want kids - how you and your partner were raised - your expectations on parenting, talk about your faith and values - what makes you passionate or angry, talk about how you view money - how to spend and save. 

Lastly watch how they interact with others - especially when they are not “on” like with family or even a waiter. Watch who they mode themselves after - who do they look up to and and want to be like. Not just who they say but actually how they act. 

If you hesitate to ask any of these questions or they are resistant to answering - deeply consider whether your relationship is mature enough for marriage.",0

It’s easy to look as learning as a big time investment. Maybe you’ll want to go back to school or take classes and think, it’ll take forever to finish that. Is it worth months or years to get into shape, learn a new skill, get a degree?

Remember that the time will pass anyway. In a week, a year, or a decade, you won’t want to look back wondering where the time went.

So do something memorable, something you’ll appreciate. Take a trip. Learn a language. Learn to cook. Build a kite. Call a friend. Become a phlebotomist. Whatever fits you — whatever you’ll be glad you did, spend time on that.

1021,"Take interest in things. Be mentally engaged, be mindful.

 Don't rely on others for happiness, find your worth in yourself, in your hobbies. And it's ok to spend money on your hobbies.

I wish I learned that last bit sooner. I was never told it, but figured it out watching my best friends father. He always poured himself into any hobby he enjoyed. Archery, gaming, golf, guitar, fitness, growing weed, and now flight simulators. The guy built himself up from a janitor to making over 120k a year with 100k in the bank. He has taught me alot about being a person. 

With work, I'm mentality engaged, mindful of what it takes to stand out. Trick my brain into learning things I would otherwise have no interest in. The trick is, I wanna move up stand out,  if X = praise and a drop in the bucket of success, I'll do X exactly as it should be done, covering all angles so it's perfect. X outside of work means nothing, but at work it's everything and I don't forget it. 

This applies to everyone, never rely on anyone who didn't have a long track record of reliability. Example I have 5 great people in my life. If I need anything I can call them, they willf stop what they are doing and help me. One is my mother the other 3 are life long friends and 1 is my life long friends father. I didn't have a father growing up and my mother taught me that friendship is thr most important thing, that blood means nothing, trust and respect is earned. 

Mostly love yourself, enjoy ther little things, the sunrise, fresh cut grass the way the wind blows as the trees move and the birds chirp, your friends laughter, good moments in time that are often overt looked by daily stress and the passing of time.

I wasn't told most things, I figured it out, mirrored successful people, found my self worth and lost it many times, but I always seem to find it again. 

Fathers are important, but they don't nef to be blood related. My real father hasn't been in my life since I was 8 or 9. You don't realise how damaging that is until you grow. But it doesn't mean I don't have bonds with older men. If that's not possible you will still manage.",0

For love:

Learn to love yourself for who are are first. Then you won't be desperate in looking for love externally.

• a small kit of hand tools like hammer, screwdrivers, scissors, wrenches, saw, files. Have someone show you how to use them if you do not know. (you will be amazed how many people will go out of their way to share tool knowledge with you if you ask.)
• a good, wool blanket (army surplus or LL bean or Pendleton, does not matter.
• a couple of those shiny metallic emergency blankets. They work.
• a gallon of water with about 6 drops of bleach in it will stay clean for months; It has a thousand uses and if there you will use it for a lot of them. As an alternative that does not need to be refreshed, get a LifeStraw.
• a few power bars to nibble on, they can last years.
• a USB rechargeable flashlight
• a firestarter or two (matches, a striker stick or some fuel-soaked bits in sealed packaging)
• a small airplane bottle or flask of good liquor. Not vodka or tequila, those are for spring break at the club. Whiskey, Scotch, Bourbon or go hardcore and use plain moonshine or everclear, which can also be used like starting fluid for a carburetor or a campfire.
• a sealed container (even a ziplock bag) with some aspirin, ibuprofen, toothpaste, toothbrush, bandaids, tums, eye drops, cough drops, safety pins, a razor blade, a couple of any meds you must take daily
• a roll of gorilla tape. Not 3M. gorilla tape.
• a compass.
• a dry pair of socks and underwear in a ziploc
All of these things seem obvious enough, but during your travel through life, if you need these things or someone you meet needs them, having them on hand is a magical experience.

1031,"I’m sorry you lost your Dad so young. I’m trying to imagine what I’ll be advising my daughter at 22.

Relationships: Some will truly love you and some just want to use you. What they say can be misleading. Pay attention to what they do, and don’t do. That will show you their priorities. Trust and respect are key. Liars lie, they don’t stop... best to kick that trash to the curb.

Money: Don’t get sucked in to credit card debt. Don’t put more on a card than you can pay off in cash. Live a little under your means so you can save. Pay yourself first, 10% off the top of you can, set it up to automatically come out of every paycheck. If your company has a 401k match make sure you save enough to get it all. It’s free money don’t pass it up. Every time you get a raise, bump your savings rate +1%. If you do it with your raise, you won’t miss it. When you get an SO, be the one who manages the money. A lot of girls give this job to the man—don’t! It’s too important. If your SO is really better at investing and you want them to handle, still make sure you know where all the money is, have the account #s and passwords, go over the statements regularly. When it’s time to treat yourself, experiences are part of you forever, things either get lost or clutter your house.

Repairs: Learning to do simple home and car maintenance can save you a lot of money, and also give you a great feeling when you succeed in fixing it yourself. Get yourself a decent set of basic tools and don’t be afraid of them. YouTube is great for this. Ask friends for help, but ask the person to teach you, and you do it with their guidance don’t just sit and watch.

The Three Be’s: Be kind. Be true. Be brave. In that order. Honesty and authenticity is important but if you have a choice between brutally honest vs kind, choose kindness—that’s why it’s first. (Don’t forget to be kind to yourself, too.) Bravery—standing up for yourself, standing up for others, taking risks, those things are harder but sometimes you need to ask yourself what would you do if you weren’t afraid, and take that leap. At 22, now is the time to be taking some risks. If there’s something you want to try or someplace you want to go, do it don’t wait.

Finally... Volunteer! Meet people, learn stuff, be part of something bigger than yourself, make a difference.

Best wishes!",0
1032,"Surround yourself with people that treat you with respect, love you for who you are, and encourage you to be the best version of yourself.

My oldest daughter is 10.  Is there anything your dad said or could have said to you that I could pass onto my girls at this stage?",0
1033,"
Wow! A lot of people gave some really great advice. Here are somehings my dad never taught me, but life taught me through great people and experiences “listen” a skill we often forget the older we get. We get wiser everyday, but that doesn’t mean we should stop listening. The world and it’s people has so much to offer us and if we don’t listen to it or the people in it, especially the people we hold most important to us they/it will slip away. Practice it as much as you can because the older you get the hard it gets. 
Pt 2. “Sensitivity” crying, being confused, being emotional, hurting non of these traits will make you any less of a “man”. Part of this monologue from the movie call me by your name kind of explains it a little Better Ethan I can “We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster, that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to make yourself feel nothing so as not to feel anything ― what a waste!” My father was cold and would only show anger. I pity him. He has lost his ability to express sadness or hurt because of the world that made him. Don’t let yourself be “bankrupt” of emotion. Feeling is a sign that you care. That you are alive and is shown to be more of a man than most.
Pt3. My final lesson is a little biblical. We are all creatures on this earth. We all bleed the same blood, breathe the same air. Don’t let bigotry or ignorance control you. Every person on this earth is your brother and sister they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. It doesn’t matter race, creed, gender, sexual preference, we are all people. Love people fiercely. Love people until there is nothing left. Show them compassion where the world may show them pain. It may drain you. It may leave you vulnerable to pain, but in the end i grantee you it’s worth it

By doing that you wont be swayed by other people’s opinion.

Example:

Someone: “Haha you are a slow thinker”
You: “Yes I realise that. I prefer to think first to take any decision wisely. I am also improving my thinking process speed”


2. Sociopaths exist around us

Learn about sociopaths. Avoid unnecessary drama by simply avoiding them in your real life. Learn their characteristics so you know who to avoid, and if you happen to have to deal with one, learn how to deal with that person safely.


3. Consistency leads you to success

Not your IQ, not your money, not your network, not your hardwork, not your luck.

A person might have all of them, but if he is not consistent in working it out, he wont be successful.

This is why successful person will still be successful even if he start everything from scratch or even debt.


4. Dont be afraid to try new things

As long as the new things do not have long-term consequence, such as unwanted pregnancy.

Learn many things, understand how things work.

Leadership, communication, hand sign communication, morse code, other languages, magic, relationship, understanding man, understanding woman, programming, video editing, puzzle, drawing, arts, practicing expression, how to find out if someone is lying, math, physics, religion, fashion, hairstyle, etc.

Also, if you go to college/university, work hard from the beginning and learn well. I didn’t study enough at university and, while I did pass my classes, I can’t remember some of the material (chemistry) and it threatens to kick me in the butt in future jobs.

Take time to be out in nature. It is healthy for your body and your mind.

Get enough sleep and exercise.

Learn to function alone. Whether at home, at work, with friends or family, etc become comfortable with being alone. Friends will come and friends will go, and family may not (unfortunately) be there for you. You will grow stronger and be more capable if you are able to function by yourself and value your own company.

Read. It can lead to wonderful adventures, and will help you to continue learning. Knowledge can save your life.

Learn first-aid and some survival skills.

1045,"1-Career. Find a career in something you love and is financially rewarding. If you have a particular edge such as customer relationships or a special skill you can branch off and likely will become a successful entrepreneur. Go at everything 100%. Do not trust any boss or corporation. They will always throw you under the bus if things take a downturn. If you want a career in government, make sure you get your pension, it is the most important aspect when you are older. 

2- Personal finance. Save at least 10% of your salary/income, hopefully more. Seek wealth not things that show off to others or stroke your ego. Have a separate emergency fund. Only buy a home if you know you will be in it for 5 years or more OR it is a quickly expanding region with increasing demand. Buy things you will cherish over time and fight the urge for spontaneous purchases. Do not buy things on the spot, especially timeshares.

3- Marriage. The person you marry will not be the same person in 20 years. Marry someone who would be your friend gerneally, rather than someone where you mainly have physical chemistry. Half of people get divorced and many still married are unhappy. The best thing in life is having children of your own. Love them unconditionally.",0

""Find a man that will treat you with the same respect and protectiveness as I do. He's not supposed to harm you, but protect you from those who do. Find a man that will be the safe space when the whole world is on fire, not be the arsonist himself. Find a man that will be offended when you're scared - since you both know he has everything under control. If a man questions your beauty and humanly worth, he should be out of the door, because there's no circumstance under which he'll be right about that. Find a man as such, so that when I'm no longer here, I can rest peacefully knowing you're taken care of."" 

I'm so sorry your dad isn't with us anymore, but he'll always be with you. And whoever you are, whatever you do, I can almost bet that if he were to look at you now, he'd be hella proud.",0
1048,"Dear u/InsomniacReaper,

First off, I just wanted to say how sorry I am that you lost your father. Losing someone that is supposed to be such a large part of your life hurts and if you need to, talk with someone you trust. I know my comment will probably lost to the wilds of Reddit and I’ll probably repeat a lot of things already said, but I wanted to pass on some things I learned while making many mistakes and hope that you’ll never have to make them. If you have any questions or need me to clarify anything don’t hesitate to reach out and ask any questions you may have.  

1. There is nothing worth having if you hate everything you had to do to get it. 

There are a lot of things we want to buy and there are a lot of jobs in the world. If you’re staying at your job because it pays well or just seems like the thing PEOPLE DO at this point in their life... then don’t stay there. Find something that makes you happy and then find a place that makes you feel good and will help you pursue whatever career you choose. 

2. Don’t let the fear of something not being perfect prevent you from pursuing it. 

This can apply to so many things but I’m speaking more along the lines of people. No one is perfect and you shouldn’t expect them to be. Also, don’t expect yourself to be perfect either. I’m not speaking just romantically either. Friends, family, co-workers and even strangers. People are a complex mess of thoughts and emotions trying to get through the day. Don’t go looking for only the negatives and take the time to find the worth of another person. You might be surprised to see how many good people are out there. 

3. Your health is something worth investing in. (Physically and Mentally) 

I was constantly told this by my father growing up and I never listened. Holy shit do I regret it (Sorry I tend to swear a lot and we’ll touch base on that in number 4). I was young and ate Taco Bell basically for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I was always active and still am, but there are two things that I wish I paid more attention to. First of all, nutrition is crazy important and can be the difference between feeling like crap all day and feeling ready to tackle anything that comes your way. Secondly, take time to heal! Physically and emotionally; never disregard your mental health. I would get hurt and try my hardest to just keep moving on. Whether it was a break up or a broken leg. I ruined a lot of good relationships by not taking the time to heal. I’ve also ruined pretty much my entire leg from pushing it when I should’ve just allowed it to heal. There is nothing weak about taking care of yourself. 

4. Always be your true self. 

I know a lot of people who try to be different when they are in public or at work. They try to act like how they believe people would like them to act. The problem is no one can fake it forever and eventually people will come to know who you really are. I’m not saying fuck it all to socially accepted or work appropriate behavior. Just don’t pretend to be anyone than who you really are. If you try to fake your way through everyone is eventually going to find out and you’ll just be THAT person who lies about who they are. This also applies to your faults. I’m not perfect. I swear a lot and make way too many inappropriate jokes to my wife, but thankfully she accepts all those things about me. I also use to be so angry and irrational sometimes. I had to be honest and true to myself about those things too. I was unnecessarily short tempered and rude just because I was having a bad day or stuck in a bad place. I was lucky enough to have someone in my life that called me out on my bullshit and I was honest about who I was and learned to better those parts of myself. 

5. Always be open to learning.  

Yes, school is important, but there is so much more to learn outside the classroom. Not only is there a lot to learn about this amazing planet we live on but there is a lot to learn about yourself as well. Finding new things to learn about is probably one of the best things I could have ever done for myself. Not only did appreciate more of the world around me and the different places, history and cultures of the world. I found out a lot about myself and who I wanted to be. Never miss an opportunity to learn. At work this has made me an expert in my field because I was never afraid to admit other people might know more or have something to teach me. I have yet to find a single downside to the benefits of learning.  

6. Find someone who wants to grow and wants to do that with you. 

This time I am speaking romantically only because that is where this experience comes from. No matter who you are, no matter how much work you put in to yourself. You’ll never be “perfect”. The same goes for anyone you fall in love with. My wife isn’t perfect and I sure as hell am not perfect. We both accepted these things about each other and made a very conscious choice to work together and grow as a couple in a direction we both want to move in. It’s a cliché but communication is everything in a relationship. Be honest with what you want out of a relationship and what you expect out of a relationship, but don’t just dictate these things (I did that a lot when I was younger). Ask your partner what they want as well. What do they want to improve on? What do that want for their career? What do they want for a family? The right person will want to talk with you and grow with you. Also, never think having this conversation once is good enough. Having these conversations a couple times every year, is what helps keep my wife and I on track. To ensure we are growing together, not apart. 

7. There isn’t anything you can’t do. 

I hope all parents would tell their kids this and I hope someone has said this to you before, but if not, here we go. You are a strong, beautiful, brave, intelligent and amazing woman. I believe in you and don’t have a single doubt in my mind that you will go into the world and conquer it. You are everything we as parents to the next generation could ever hope for.  

I could go on for years telling you all the things I’ve learned from messing up. Probably could fill a few dozen books actually... I’ve messed up a lot. As will all things, I have to stop at some point. Just know if you ever have questions, I and all of us here will always be around to help answer any questions you have.  

Hoping for the best of everything for you and your life,

1059,"I don’t know if I’m the best equipped to answer that question, but it depends on what type of martial art you want to do, since not all martial arts are created equal or even similar. Definitely don’t go to any “strip-mall martial arts” type places, they tend not to be super great. Places you’ve heard about by word of mouth are worth checking out (ie if you’ve got any friends on social media that ever post about them or whatever). Find yourself someone whose passion it is to teach self-defense, they won’t let you down. Now to help you decide what type you want to do, let me give you a run down of a few martial arts I kind of know:

Kuk Sul Do - A Korean martial art. This is the one I did for the longest time. It is fairly traditional and fairly balanced between kicks, punches, and throws. My instructor also did Brazilian Jiu Jitsu so so we did a fair amount of ground work too (like wrestling/grappling, chokes and locking limbs). So our dojang was extremely well balanced.

Tae Kwon Do (Taekwondo) - Also a Korean martial art. The differences between this and Kuk Sul Do are fairly minimal, but imo Taekwondo has a larger emphasis on kicks and utilizing the lower half of your body. Great for starters, but easy to accidentally join a mediocre gym that focuses more on money and business rather than teaching their students well (because this is one of the most common ones).

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) - This is the martial art of martial arts, as in these guys will beat you the fuck up, since BJJ is one of the most dedicated and hard-to-progress-in martial arts. Jiu Jitsu un general focuses on getting your opponent to the ground and then finishing them off there, so ifs basically all throwing people, taking falls, and grappling others into choke holds and submissions. Probably not good for someone who doesn’t want to get serious about martial arts, although it is imo one of the most effective martial arts.

Aikido - I think that’s how it’s spelled. Idk much about this one but I had a few friends who did it. They said it has emphasis on using the momentum of your opponents body to either throw them, get them out of the way and create distance, or manipulate them into a submission. Idk if they do any punching, kicking, etc.

At the end of the day, most people are *very* nervous and feel awkward walking into their first martial arts class, but don’t worry about it. Nobody is gonna judge you no matter your body type, or how weak or strong you are. If you stick with it you’re sure to find your fit eventually. Good luck!",0

1072,">I'm thankful for the heartaches and the romances that have passed. Trying to objectify women for years has actually done the complete opposite- the more I met and slept with women, the more I realized that it doesn't matter.  

I'm not sure you appreciate how important it was for you to go thru that. I completely agree with most of what you said.  In my 20s all I cared about was having as much sex as I could with as many physically attractive people as possible.  Once I hit 30 everything changed.  

But we're both speaking from positions of privilege in the sense that we were both able to have those experiences and learn from them.  A lot of guys (or people in general) aren't able to have that.  If a person yearns for sex because they have had very little of it in life...I wouldn't come thru and say, ""Sex is as desirable as eating, sleeping, or shitting. It's great for a few moments and then it ends. It's the life you live before and after that matters. There are many more satisfying things in life, filled with much more substance"" because that would be a very tone deaf response and doesn't empathize what they're going thru.  

I think you should celebrate the fact that you were able to experience these opportunities to grow as a person...and give yourself credit for being able to do so (because a lot of people DONT grow).

3. Needing a partner to ""complete"" your life is a red flag. You first learn to be happy by yourself, then you integrate other people as complements, not as the main focus.

But it kind felt like from age 15-25 that was literally the only goal in life and that everything else was just a fun way to spin my wheels between romps in the sack. Like everything was about getting laid. Going out with the boys? Hoping to meet a girl. Doing well in school/work? Hoping success will bring interest from women. Getting good at almost any hobby? To impress women. Hell even hanging out with the boys and no girls around felt like it was about somehow impressing non-existent women who are not seeing the activity were up to, and yet it felt like I was still trying to turn fun time with the boys into ""Stories later to impress women."" if you catch my meaning.

Now I've got a lot different focuses and a lot more stuff on my plate worth delving into instead of looking for my next proverbial shag. I also met a beautiful amazing woman who I married and is more to me than just sex object.

But I also had *lots* of sex from age 15-25 and so on. That isn't a brag, it's just to help inform. Someone who has been a stone cold virgin until they were 25 or older may feel differently about sex since they've only recently started having it. But I've known at least half a dozen women, done it a lot with a few of them, and done it in almost every way you can, even had a threesome or two.

Sex is like eating, it's fun in the moment but the feeling doesn't last and when you're done you've got nothing to show for it. I've found that while I enjoy sex, a huge part of why I was chasing it was the validation that went with it. It wasn't that I thought sex was objectively super fun, it was that I liked feeling desired and wanted when I had sex.

Fast forward and after fucking what is probably close to a hundred different women I've slowly realized that it doesn't really matter at all. Sex is no longer validating, which means sex is no longer all that great. Now I'm really only excited to have sex if it's with a girl I'm really passionate about or if it's extraordinarily kinky. I'd rather jerk off than fuck some cute 23 year old accountant.

It has made dating much less exhausting, though, because if I don't vibe with the girl I just end things quickly and forget about her. I don't feel like I have to fuck here for the sake of fucking her, so there's no pretending to like a girl or anything like that.",0
1086,"There are different octaves of love / sexuality. Self development is pretty key and a good relationship is always evolving and being refreshed by whatever new stuff each partner is bringing to the table. 

The fact that you’re calling it “Pussy” is because you’re almost relating to at as a commodity. Once you find an amazing woman who you truly care about and admire on all levels (intelligence, humour, wisdom, beauty, sexiness), you move beyond the realms of “acquiring pussy”... and you enter the realms of sacred sexuality and this stuff is EXHILARATING and always lasts for 45mins to 2 hours on average, and pushes you consistently into new states of physical and emotional awareness.

The human body/mind has a very complex emotional guidance system and when sex is happening without deep love, it can only go so far. The stimulation becomes repetitive and predictable and you eventually feel something along the lines of shame or that there is no point.

Life is infinite. Think creatively, work on creating your best self, and keep your eyes peeled for the goddess of your dreams... they tend to find you once you finally give up and commit to yourself :)

1098,"I'm confused.  Feels like a different situation though.

I don't think any couple is 100% in sync on sexual needs at all times.  I also have no issue with masturbation.  

The people I'm talking about, and honestly OP's partner could actually be one of them and he may just be blissfully unaware, are the people whose primary sexual relationship winds up being with their hand.  The people who would start out not pushing if their partner wasn't in the mood and then just masturbate, and then would sort of start noticing over time that their partner was consistently more concerned with something else and not in the mood.  They would notice that it's been a couple weeks or a couple months since they were last intimate, and that pattern would repeat.  And they'd talk to their partner about it at some point, and their partner would start by being surprised because they're perfectly content and they didn't even realize there was an issue.  And later as the pattern repeats their partner would become defensive in future conversations, because they're tired of talking about something that they are unilaterally just fine with and they resent being told that their lack of interest is an issue.  

Long, rambling paragraph to say that over time it pretty often spirals out.  We aren't talking about a scenario where you jack off every once in awhile, we are talking about people with high drives paired with people with low drives who wind up masturbating daily or almost daily, who go into a sort of starvation mode where it becomes hard not to fixate, who start to resent the fact that their partner doesn't really seem to care about their needs, might not seem to be affectionate in the way they need it at all.  They feel guilty over making an issue if their needs, even though it is an issue, they wonder if their partner is even attracted to them anymore.  It's a bad scene.

It doesn't sound like that's what your situation was though.  It sounds like you were more compatible sexually than the kind of mismatch I was talking about.  Sex was still important though, it just wasn't the real issue.  Sorry you had to go through that.",0

Turned out, I was a more interesting person because I was actually passionate about whatever it is that I was doing, and that made me more attractive to the women I ran into.

Like your ex, trying to explain something to someone that they aren't interested in, that doesn't turn them on, that they have no motivation to do is, to return to the breathing analogy, like trying to explain what breathing is and why it's important to someone who doesn't need to breathe.  You're just frustrated and annoyed and asking ""mother fucker, how are you walking around without breathing?  How do you not get that I pass out and die if I don't?""

Not that lack of sex causes us to pass out and die, but I think that's a fair statement about what happens to the relationship.",0

It’s okay to want a relationship but it’s not okay to think that it’ll solve all your problems because relationships aren’t supposed to be about yourself. It’s about you and the other person as a couple and working together in this world. 

Like you said. You can still want a relationship and actively look for one. But you should be confident enough in yourself to know weather a person will actually add a positive into your life or a negative. I think a lot of young and inexperienced guys think that once they get with someone then all the pieces will come together and that’s where the problems start because a lot of relationships also depend on consistent growth as well. The relationship will never be the same as it was when you first start dating so you need to keep growing or the relationship might fall apart.",0

1110,"So, my great uncle was pretty much my grandfather for how involved he was and how attached I was to him. My most vivid memory was when I fucked up. 

So backstory, my uncle is huge into fishing, not competitive, just hobby fishing every day. So I went to look for worms for the day for us. I was probably 7 or 8. I took a shovel and bucket and headed to the woods. Started digging and like any kid, started prying logs and roots over. I ended up breaking the shovel though. I was terrified. I had no idea how he would react. I had betoken things before and gotten in trouble but mostly it was the fact that I wouldn't be able to go fishing with him that day that bugged me.  I go back and tell him what happened, he laughs, passes me a fiberglass handled one and challenges me to go break it. I went back out and had a great rest of my day. 

I asked him about it when I was older. Why didn't he get mad. He said I broke a tool when using it in a reasonable way. He couldn't get angry for that, because it was the shovels fault, not mine. I know this may seem stupid but it was important to me at the time. 

Sadly he passed away in 2012 and never got to meet my wife and kids but my son is named after him.",0

1112,"**Maternal grandpa** (He passed away when I was 3):

One funny thing my mom told me about her dad is that he loved to smoke cigarettes. He loved to smoke so much that whenever they went swimming at a lake or at the sea, he went swimming wearing a hat, sunglasses and a lit cigarette in his mouth. I mean... that's almost Churchill-style (except that Churchill would've smoked a cigar instead). It's interesting how times have changed.

From what I've heard, though, my grandpa was also a very soft-spoken, sweet and caring men who loved his wife and children deeply and treated them with a lot of respect. Apparently, my grandparents' relationship was very egalitarian, which is definitely not self-understanding for people born in the early 1920s. So, I think that's something really cool about him.

**Paternal grandpa** (He is still alive)

When my paternal grandpa was a young lad, about 19 or 20 years old (he's now 88), he went on a vacation trip to the Spanish island of Ibiza. There, he frequented a café in a small town. One day he was approached by a local who was trying to sell land. I've forgotten the details of the story but basically, this guy offered him insane amounts of land for pocket change (it was all real, no scam). The land was located right at the coast and it would've cost my grandpa something like 50 cents per square mile. Now, this was a little more money back then but it would still be pocket change today; maybe $5 in modern-day money. The guy who sold the land told my grandpa he could buy 20, 50 or even 100 square miles. Back then, the land was basically worthless because nobody had any idea what to use it for. It was just beaches, wild meadows etc. My grandpa declined the offer. The guy then asked my grandpa if he should show him the area, so he might reconsider. However, my grandpa again declined. In his words, he couldn't imagine why he'd possibly need land on a random island called Ibiza. Affording the land would've been no problem at all, my grandpa just couldn't understand why he should buy land.

Almost 70 years later, Ibiza is known as a tourism hotspot and a ""party island"" for Europeans. There are large hotels all along the coast and a square mile of land in the area where my grandpa had been is now worth millions of Euros. My family could have a fortune in the 8-or perhaps even 9 figures if my grandpa had made a different decision back then. Instead, we're just regular middle-class trying to scrape by.",0

Anyway he passed away in 2016 after being diagnosed with cancer. Probably about a month from diagnosis to death. When he was in the hospital after diagnosis my dad and uncle spent some time with him. A few days later I was talking to my dad and he said when they were talking my grandfather said that while we weren't able to communicate well with him, he loved just being near us even if nothing was going on. I'm tearing up just thinking about that. He was honestly the grandparent that I felt closest too despite the language barrier",0

Working in his fairly large garden.  We had strawberries, corn, potatoes, tomatoes etc.  

Pepper.  He liked pepper and I always had to have “that black stuff grandpa uses” on my food.  

Going to the bowling alley with him in the mornings during the summers.  I would have them wake me up early so I could go with him to the bowling alley.  I wasn’t a huge fan of it at the time on some days but damn, I loved that time with him.  He would meet his old buddies and talk about all the stuff old farmers did.  And I would sit and drink my coffee with him just like he had it with nothing in it.  Just straight bowling alley coffee.  I was probably around 6-7 at the time.  Grandma didn’t approve.  Also didn’t approve of him smoking but I wouldn’t rat him out.  On purpose that is.  


I was a middle kid of 5 in a divorced home.  Older siblings stuck to each other and you get siblings stuck to each other.  My grandpa provided me a friend and a father figure.

But all that apparently changed when I was born. I was his first grandchild, and mom told me he started acting like the father he never was with them (they were 3 sisters, each a year apart).

Every summer I would spend a few weeks with them (we lived far). We often went fishing, which is something I haven't ever enjoyed outside the times we went together (my father loves it, sadly I don't share the passion). He also had plenty of old Russian weapons, so when I was 8 I was already able to handle and tinker with most of those guns. Of course mom didn't approve since it is dangerous, but she can't really say no to her father, can she? We did a lot of engineering on his old car too...

He was one wild motherfucker... He was also who taught me how to play chess, nine men's morris (or known also simply as 'mill'), checkers, and various card games. Lots of math and logical puzzles that I think really helped my school years.

He died when I was 10, and 3 months after my other, paternal grandfather passed too, with whom I did a lot of gardening, farming and tending for animals. Also plenty of carving, I still have one of the - honestly terrible - wooden figurines I made alone at that time. Both of them died earlier because they were stubborn, not listening to the doctor at all...

One of my grandmothers has always had a horrible personality, but the other one was the stereotypical sweet as honey grandmother, but in the last 3 years she's been succumbing to her age and became rather irritating and unreasonable... Times change and it is crazy.

I was an emotional wreck after being widowed at a young age. Years pass, and I met someone while on vacation.  She had a 5yo little girl, and the girl's father had died about a year earlier. The woman and I bonded over our shared experiences and stayed in touch.

A slowly simmering long distance relationship develops. Eventually she adopts her cousin's child. Now she has a girl and a much younger boy. Things get more serious. Visits become more frequent. Talk turns to family and marriage. And we both say our family is complete and we do not want more kids. And we marry.

I am now 48 and I swear baby fever has hit me just this year. Hard. It is biological. It is a craving like I have only heard women describe. I pass the baby section at Walmart and start checking out strollers. This is gnawing at me. 

I am 48. My wife is 44 and had to have a hysterectomy for medical reasons. She is a wonderful woman, loving and caring. But she is not the most educated woman. She asks me to explain medical questions that she or her friends have.

I spoke to her about what I am feeling and she immediately said we could get a surrogate. She heard it costs such and such amount here, but back in her home country it is cheaper. She knows someone who went to a particular fertility clinic back home. And on, and on.  She had very obviously been researching this.

If your just their coworker who is training them, treat them like you would any friend who you see struggling and just keep asking if they need help and try to be as supportive as you can. At some point though you may need to pass them off to a boss who will be able to give them more direction if they aren't able to keep things focused. It isn't your job to make them a better employee, its to show them the process, and if they aren't getting it you might need to pass them off to someone else.  

If youre their boss then you need to still be supportive but you also need to be clear in your expectations. One of those being that they have to speak up and be able to recognize when they make an error. Errors are OK to make when you're still learning but they have to be able to ask for help when something does happen. They also need to be able to not keep making the same mistake over and over again. Let them know they aren't going to be in trouble for mistakes and if they need to go slow at first that's fine, a perfect project that takes an extra hour is always preferable to a rushed project that has to have a dozen errors corrected. Also make sure they know who they can look to for help, including yourself and other managers and coworkers.


 You could try having them write out the process rather than just going through it manually. Writing it out can make you stop and really think about the steps. If they know it all written out but aren't getting it in practice, then have them go through it all step by step checking off the steps as they go.

I've been married 2x (F,F). Had kids with the first. And brought my kids to the 2nd marriage. She had 3 older kids from 2 other marriages. It didn't go great. I think i tried to over-parent, which didn't work well. Probably did that because my kids were younger and that's what i knew. I don't talk to her kids anymore. I will occasionally say 'hi' to my ex. I'm in a relationship now. She has 2 kids, slightly younger than my kids. My kids don't live with us, they're grown. One of hers is here 1/2 time, the other is home sometime from college. We are mostly civil, but don't hang out. Her youngest doesn't engage with me, hardly talks to me. but that's kind of the type of kid/young-adult she is. My gf gets along pretty well with my kids, they chat / talk. Are able to speak when I'm not around. Maybe it's me as a parent.

One morning I woke up to the sensation of feeling hugged (I live by myself) and in my 30s, and as weird as it sounds, could smell him in my apartment which he had never been in before.

I had a few of these types of experiences shortly after he passed whether things getting knock over (where context had meaning) or extremely vivid dreams or feelings of deja vu and connection.  They stopped after a time but they were so real...  it sounds crazy and wasn’t in my head.

My grandma passed away a month after him.  When she was in hospice, she was still mentally very much there.  I was visiting one afternoon and she was telling me that you may think I’m crazy but I saw your grandfather (her deceased husband) and they were chatting to each other on a few occasions.  This occurred three weeks before she passed.  I asked her if she really believed it was him or some sort of projection from her mind.  She was adamant that they were talking and he was visiting her and knew she was close to the end.

There is something there at the end of life that might not be so black and white.... I’m not religious, don’t know what it means, but these all occurred and were very real.  It sort of changed my thinking a bit on these things.  I obviously know it’s not the physical person or ghosts, but maybe something like energy lingers a bit or those close to death gain some perceptions we may not be in tuned with.

Don't pass them, match their pace; this is a classic psychology move to create feelings of affiliation and sympathy. They might be scared of other men on the trail, so stick with them as long as possible, and walk as close as possible to them.

If, despite all this, things still go badly and she starts to yell at you, scream, or threaten you with pepper spray, it's time to whip out the big guns. Show her your hands so she knows you don't have a weapon; they should be as far apart as they will go to the sides and up above your head. Plant your feet far apart and rock from side to side; this is the most soothing of all motions. Give her a big, open mouthed smile (your mouth should be open as far as it will go).

It's very hard. He passed away suddenly. No one knew he was ill. He kept things to himself. He didn't want to burden other people with his troubles. I wish he was still here. 

Take your time. You will know what is right and what your dad wants you to do. No one else can tell you what is right and what is wrong.

1195,"Lost my dad a few years ago, it came during a difficult time and on the heels of another death in our family. What helped for me was speaking to an older co worker who told me about his father and what it was like for him being the youngest of his siblings and the last living member of that family group. He had his wife, kids, grand kids etc. but he had been alone without his siblings or parents for several years. He was a veteran, first time he ever showed that much emotion.

A second co worker chimed in on he barely reacted to his dad passing but the minute his mother passed away he nearly committed suicide since in his words “my angel left me”. 

It kinda came together since at the time I worked in a union job and we had a large group of older unions members. All of them had stories of what it was like. It filled me at first with a sad dread of reality. But something about it was comforting.

As far as the pain, regret, remorse, anger, sadness and whatever strong emotion you might feel that won’t go away. I couldn’t go to my families thanksgiving the first year when he passed. I couldn’t listen to certain songs since they were his favorite and if by chance someone else was playing it i would just freeze and forget what I was doing. Radio always off when I drive. Don’t go to bars or family gatherings anymore.

Odd things bring back memories and maybe it’s just me but lately I struggle to remember him until something stupid comes along.  Like when I was a kid and wanted a pb and J and we didn’t have bread but we had English muffins. So I toasted it and went to town, my dad stopped me said it was stupid then asked me to make him one.

My mom told me one of the last things he ate before he passed was a toasted English muffin pb and j and that it was the weirdest thing he asked for as a snack.

I almost screwed the parallel parking but I was lucky there was no other cars that day so I just looked jittery upon execution 

Otherwise I practiced the route they have all drivers do there before I even took the test so it went great 

Funny thing was the dude wanted to prank his co worker & there was a random walkie talkie he had in the car so he passed it over to me as a joke 

I as a straight dude with a deep voice said “Hey what are you wearing?”

Co worker goes “BRO WHAT THE FUCK WHAT” 

Then me & instructor start laughing our asses off then he says to go get my shit/go home/good job 

Honestly I got lucky as shit with my instructor & the place being super relaxed. I asked around a lot of my friends at my university among which places had the most forgiving tests & I gladly traveled an extra city over specifically for this one",0
1207,"Three times but because I got literally the worst DMV lady in our entire county. My driving coach even took me to another DMV than her usual one to do it because she was notorious for failing almost everyone-she ended up being there anyway to cover someone else's shift, but luckily I finally passed her scrutiny (maybe she was in a good mood that day because her son's marriage proposal was accepted, though).",0
1208,I couldn't pass the permit test.  It's just a written test.  Failed like 3 times or something.  Finally the highschool had it in the library and I just cheated off the closest girl.  But after that I passed first time for driving.  Also first time with my motorcycle endorsement.,0

Took 2 tries on the AZ cdl because I passed the driving test and got the A but I failed the Z part so I had to wait 3 days and rewrite the air brake test.",0
1212,"It took me 3 tries to finally pass. I just didn't have enough practice and confidence for the test. My dad never let me practice, and the only practice I had was with the driving instructors. The first time, the person who was testing me had to pull the emergency brake because I didn't brake in time before the stop sign. The second time, I forgot what happened, but I failed. Last time, I passed! Thank God. I wish I had more practice with someone, not just a few one-hour driving sessions here and there. My dad wasted so much money! You can do it, as long as you pass!",0

She hopped in. Said ""go ahead."" And I buckled up, adjusted the mirrors and drove. Made two mistakes (bumped on curb turning a corner and didn't back up straight when reversing. She said she doesn't understand why it was on the test because no one ever backs up as much as we were tested on.)

What made me nervous was that she didn't talk much or gave any indication about how I was doing until she handed me the paper and said ""congratulations.""",0

1218,"It took me 2 attempts and I was pretty bummed out after my failure.  I still don’t believe it was warranted. 

I was driving a mini van in a neighborhood and when I was performing the parallel parking portion, the rear window of the van hit a branch that was hanging over the edge of the sidewalk into the street. The instructor counted it as a “collision” so I instantly failed. Haha

My Ma and I drove back to the tree after the test and agreed that the ruling was bullshit.  The 2nd time, I got a much nicer instructor and passed with flying colors.  Sounds like you got a similar shit end of the stick as my first time.  Hang in there!",0
1219,"I did mine in Canada about 10 years ago - where I grew up you needed to test for your Class 7 license, present an N (new driver) sign on the back of your car for two years, then test for your Class 5 so you could drive without the N sign.

I failed my first Class 7 test because I didn't shoulder check to the right enough. I thought it was stupid at the time but the next time I did it I made sure to physically move my head all over the place when I was making any kind of turn, or even glancing in my mirrors, and passed.

I failed my Class 5 the first time as well because I made a turn out of a park zone (30km/h) and made the mistake of thinking I actually was out of the park zone, so began to accelerate. Got to 35km/h and was told by my instructor that we're still in a park zone and the speed limit is 30km/h. She failed me for that, but told me to pay attention and come back in two weeks and I'll be fine. Did just that and got an absolute ***dick*** of an instructor, but surprisingly passed. Grumpy old Polish guy who reminded me a bit of my deceased grandfather, so when he passed me it felt like an actual good accomplishment. He seemed like the kind of guy to fail you because ""meh, you need more practice.""

In the end, don't let it get to you. Driving is easy but driving the ***exact fucking way the instructor wants you to*** is a bit difficult. Practice some more and do it again when you feel comfortable. Not sure where you live but driving around the area where the exam takes place is a huge help.",0

I can remember that first year like it was yesterday. I’d have days where I just kind of forgot , some days it would crash down on me like rock , and some days where I would just sleep . 

I sought professional help , I also sought drugs and alcohol and other stuff that I thought could help kill the pain of her death . I really burnt the candle at both ends for a long time . 

It’s been 20 years since she passed . I’ve lived more years without her than I had with her , and that was a pretty heartbreaking thing. You start to wonder if all the memories you have are true, or if they have started to fade and distort to how you want to remember . 

Like others have said , there will never be a day when you get over it , in fact don’t even make that part of your grieving.

I was 12 when I lost mine - around 17 years ago now and the truth is (along with what others have said here) you don't really get over it.

The thing is that he lived next us, and we basically did everything together. I'm very interested in both WW's because of him and we'd visit all kinds of things together. When you have a strong connection to someone, I guess you never really get over it.

We were able to say our goodbyes because the doctors knew his last day was approaching. I still recall that day in detail and I left a piece of myself in that room with him when I had to leave him behind. It's easily the worst day in my life and it sent me in a downwards spiral I still struggle with to this day. It gets better over time, but it never fades away completely",0
1230,"About 6 years. I turned 11 five days before she passed in 1999. It wasn't until later in high school after moving off with my dad as he remarried and moving back home with my mother's parents. I think what made me the most comfortable was losing my religion. Completely. That was what gave me the solice that her energy was still here, not just our memories. 

'We were talking, about the space between us all
And the people, who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away

We were talking, about the love we all could share
When we find it, to try our best to hold it there, with our love
With our love we could save the world, if they only knew

Try to realize it's all within yourself, no-one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking, about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself
Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you'

1232,"Heavy post dude...

My mom passed 1.5 years ago.  I didn't realize at the time that I would NEVER get over it.  It feels like there's a giant black hole in your life, that simply cannot be filled.  Everything you try to do to fill the void just gets sucked in and has not effect.",0

Going back further, my dad passed when I was twelve, also in December. I’m 39 now and I’m still not over it. Long term, I don’t think I’ll ever be completely over either one. 

The biggest piece of advice I can give you, based on my own personal experience, is to be open with yourself about your emotions and what you’re feeling. Don’t bottle your emotions up. Doing so is really bad and will harm you and possibly others short term and long term. Talk to somebody, anybody who’s willing to listen. Ideally it should be a close friend or a therapist, but odds are if those aren’t available, there’s people in this group, myself included, who’re willing to listen.",0

But when I finally did I was able to start healing properly. If you’ve got close friends and family don’t feel bad about needing to lean on them for help right now, and if you don’t you have an internet stranger that would listen if you wanna pm me. Hang in there buddy, it’ll take time but it will get better.",0

My mother died when I was 23 from lung cancer after a several months long illness. She was the dominant figure in my life (my father having passed away when I was 13 and often growing up, my mom did more of the parenting).

For the first several months, there was a mix of shock and emptiness. But I tried to ignore it. That was a massive mistake. 

I had a low point in my life about a year after. After her death I stopped having the kind of motivation I had before - starting failing at my job, stopped working out, and stopped eating healthy gaining a bunch of weight.

My biggest mistake was ignoring the fact that this was a traumatic/sad effect that would impact me. Had I done so, I could have realized that I was not being myself. 

Good luck and please don't make the same mistakes I did",0

1246,"My best advice is not to try to avoid grieving: set aside some time (30-60 minutes depending on your need) each day to think about her and your loss, and let the tears fall; then pack it, clean yourself up, and get on with living your life (as you can be sure she would've wanted), until the next time you need to 'bleed off the pressure of her loss'. The key is neither to shut down nor ignore the fact... It's essential to *feel* the negative/sentimental emotions, and allow them to 'pass through you' so that they will not trouble you further: bottle them for too long, and they will fester and grow to unmanageable proportions.",0
1247,"So, I'm not asian *but*... when I was younger I dropped out of a college (and went back to a different one less than a year later).  It wasn't a transfer, more of a start over in a different place doing something different.  My entire extended family that are on the same continent as me referred to me as ""the dropout"" for quite some time so there is some past history there.  When my mom passed away last year (cancer, not COVID), one of my cousins called me to express condolences and he found a way to remind me during this call that I dropped out of college back in 1993.  All of the cousins have Masters except me (BS only), so it was only my career that kept me as not a loser.

I actually think that my mother's passing last year was a significant portion of this as she was in palliative care for a few months before she passed and she had a lot of regrets on what she should have done.  She was in denial most of the time she was in hospice and that was rough due to COVID (no in person visits, etc).

Yes, the negative loop thing sounds like a version of what my CBT therapist had me doing and I'm still working on it.  I've been working on step #5 in your list a lot lately as I've been stressing over things related to the job I no longer have and that certainly isn't good, useful, or productive.

I hope that you are able to convince your wife to work part time and enjoy life.  I had this conversation with my boss but working part time would have cancelled my insurance AND I would still make too much to qualify for any help on the ACA marketplace so I would have to work full time to pay for the insurance.  But working full time gets me insurance, but I don't want to do that.  Nasty loop.

1251,"At first I thought I had hurt my back. Woke up early in the morning swearing it was time to get a new mattress. Got up, walked around, went to the bathroom and couldn't pee. Then the vomiting started and the back pain was unbearable. Went to the ER where they loaded me up with pain medication and a drug they give to old guys with prostate issues, Flomax. After a CT scan they determined I could pass it on my own and sent me home with a screen to pee through. I laid around all day with the worst pain ever. Sharp, knife stabbing pain throughout my lower back. Nothing I did made it better. The narcotics they gave me didn't help much. I couldn't keep anything down. Nothing went in and nothing came out.

Later in the evening my wife, who's a nurse, looked at the dose of Flomax they told me to take and said ""Oh, I give guys three times this amount every day. Here, take a few more."" 30 minutes later my kidneys kicked in and I peed like a racehorse. In the screen was a teensy tiny little fleck that was slightly larger than a piece of sand. That's my kidney stone story.

EDIT: As much as it sounds like my wife is the hero of the story, I have to add that she insisted on doing her hair and makeup before taking me to the ER, because her friends work there. I was ready to explode in pain and anger, but had to keep it together since she was my ride. Also, part way through the day I thought going for a drive might help dislodge the stone. During the drive she thought it would be a great idea to take me to the grocery store for a full grocery run... as I'm writhing in pain in the passenger seat. We laugh about it now, wasn't so funny then.",0
1252,"It comes in waves as the stone (or stones, often enough) travels from your kidney to your bladder. I measure it an 8 on a scale of 10 at these times.

You will feel as if you desperately need to find some comfortable position, but nothing works. The result is that you end up writhing on the floor usually.

Then it will find a new spot and the pain will subside for a while. Until it moves again.

Once it reaches your bladder, the worst is over. But not all make it there, and then either surgery or other options are tried.

But until then, it is wave after wave of hell on earth. It may seem like lower back pain at first, but will quickly become deeper and more intense.

Drink plenty of water, get pain meds, and hope it passes. You may also be prescribed a med that will ""open the faucet"" a bit. There's one called Flomax. Yup, the name fits.

Also, try to ""catch"" it with a strainer or something. Long-term prevention depends on an analysis of the stone.

Yes, I've had a few bouts, but none in several years. I caught one, got it analyzed, and was put on a small daily med. Haven't had any since.

Lastly, during one episode when I was at the ER begging for the IV so they could get me morphine (and I *hate* needles), a nurse there said she was a mother and she'd had them, and yes, it's the closest a man will get to labor pains.",0

Before leaving the nurse explained that it should pass naturally but if I start sweating for no reason get to a major hospital. Two days later the pain returns so back to the emergency department. They take Blood and give me more pain relief and send me on my way. Sitting at my computer a day later I realise I'm soaking wet with sweat. Go to a major hospital where they inform me that the results from the other hospital show that my kidneys have reduced function and should have had a stent but in days ago.

The first time I felt the urge to pee is when I passed it and I wouldn't have known it passed if it were not for the screen they gave me.

1264,"Most advice simply falls under ""be a good person"", which misses the mark for this prompt.

&#x200B;

Our society has reinforced for centuries that men teach men how to do certain things. If you're a man 20 years or older with a father figure, he probably taught you some ""man skills"" -- things women were seen as not wanting to do throughout especially the 20th century.

Continuing on whatever grandpa taught dad and dad taught you, while being open to sharing those skills with all of your children, is modern day masculinity.

It will take decades more for the streotypes of ""men fix stuff around the house, change the oil, handle everything when the family goes camping, etc."" go away. Making sure we don't allow generations to fall away from being able to do these basic tasks out of fear of being seen as toxic is important. You should fully embrace any skills dad taught you. Passing down being ""handy"" is one of the great legacies of the Western man. Teach your kids how to sharpen a knife. Teach your kids how all of the stuff in your house works. Hunting is a masculine tradition, and while it is greatly corrupted by modern ""bros"" and rich Republicans shooting elephants, it should continue. There may be a time where a family legacy of taking the kids hunting and camping a few times to learn the basics saves your great great grandchildren's lives -- look at Texas right now. Clearly we can't trust the government for everything(and I am a liberal man, I'm just being realistic here.)

There is no reason for these skills to be limited to men, but in great part they are right now, so our task is to continue teaching and maintaining these skills until society comes around and our daughters start doing it as much as our sons.

Be there for your kids. Don't resent that you carry traditionally masculine skills -- if Mom asks you to fix her water heater, be proud to help, and if you have a daughter bring her along for the job.

Don't fall into the trap of being sullen and emotionless, just because many men do it does not mean it is masculine. Rather, welcoming the streotypes when they are useful and being there for your family and friends is the most important emotional struggle of a man.

Saying things like ""be a good person"" is cute, but that applies to all people. We are discussing the specific burdens of being ""masculine"", or what men are taught and shown differently than women and how we should handle it in western culture in this time.

All of this is only a fraction of being a good person -- but it is the fraction that men are uniquely burdened with in most families.",0
1265,"To reinforce my point in case it was missed: I do not believe any of this is inherently a man's job, but our society has dictated it so for decades if not centuries, so at this point most men are in fact the ones who are ""burdened"" with being the ones who were taught how the house works, how the cars work, etc. -- we should do all we can to teach our wives and daughters these things, and yes some women do these things now, but for the most part our society as a whole is falling away from knowing these things rather than getting to a point where both men and women do them.

If you were lucky enough to have a father figure you owe it to society to continue teaching all of your children regardless of gender.

Keeping things alive that our grandfathers were expected to do because they were ""the man's job"" is in fact a specific burden of being masculine in the 21st century. We carry the burden of making sure our daughters learn what our grandfathers thought they shouldn't, while still respecting the skills passed down to us and preserving them. It is a difficult balance and defines modern masculinity.",0
1266,"Did you read my posts though?
I am agreeing with you in a sense -- I do not think any of what I am talking about is tied to men anymore. However, our grandparents who grew up in the ""fifties/sixties of the last century"" are the ones who passed down valuable skills only to our dads, who likely passed them only to us. 

It is our duty to keep alive the skills that men have been trusted with until society is ready for women to do them equally. We have to teach our daughters until it's normal. The sixties were not that long ago, we aren't just miraculously past it because a few generations have passed and most people's thinking is in line now. The dissemination of traditionally masculine skills is still on the table -- we are discarding masculinity by paying people to fix our ""man problems"".

Your attitude leads to no one maintaining the skills to fix their own faucet because that's toxic masculinity.

We are on the same team, I just don't think this is a solved issue like you do. Ending masculinity as a cornerstone concept in our society requires men acting in a certain way to make sure a time comes when ""the sink is broken"" doesn't conjure imagery of a man with a little red toolbox fixing it. We need to teach our daughters how to do what our grandfathers taught our dads to do.

Losing skills as a society that our grandfathers had is not the solution to us being uncomfortable with gender roles.",0

I definitely hated meeting new people at the bar or being in “happy” group social settings because I had this dark cloud following me everywhere and I had nothing cheerful to add.

Therapy helped tremendously, i tend to keep my feelings to myself or try to suppress them. Therapy gave me a safe space to release them and it also taught me to open up to my partner and ask for help when I’m hurting.",0
1271,"   Very sorry to hear about your loss - my thoughts and prayers are w/you.
   I lost my Dad February 17, 2011 and my Mom December 8, 2012. To be honest...I'm still coping and imagine I always will. My experience both times, I started out completely numb. I was awake only for the time I had to be and the rest of the time asleep or trying to sleep just to avoid reality and everything around me. And even sleeping wasn't a true solution because I'd have dreams about them and I'd wake up in an uncomfortable mood/state because the dreams would be so real feeling. I still have those dreams, though less frequently. Some people are comforted by those dreams, but for me I always wake up uneasy. I'm happy for and admittedly somewhat envious of those people who can have dreams about their deceased parents and find them comforting. I hope I can reach that point one day!
   After the initial numbness, came the grieving. Trying to get through the day normal was impossible. I'd be doing ok 1 moment and the next - I'd be broken down in tears, sobbing. Flooded w/vibrant memories of them, thinking back on just days or weeks before when they were still here. The desire of being able to reach out, turn back the clock somehow and be w/them again seems so doable yet of course it's not. Then when the reality hit, I'd get another rush of grief and uncontrollable tears w/an uneasy, dark gloom.
   I slowly started getting to where I eventually could get through some days w/out periodically breaking down but I'd still have an uneasy gloom following me around. Especially when it came to going through their belongings and packing them away, especially w/my Mom because she lived in the same house. So, when it came time to pack her things away and re-do her room for then present use - it felt wrong and disrespectful. How dare I touch and disturb anything? Move it, pack it up and store it away? It just felt strange and unsettling. This is Mom's room, damnit! But, keeping everything in place as it was before she passed away also didn't feel right. When I would walk into that room, I expected to see her. So, packing everything away and re-doing the room was the only thing I could think to do to help cope w/the reality that she was gone and not coming home. But she was at her true home now.
   I slowly started trying to re-gain interest in hobbies, activities etc.... but it was a slow and painful process for me before I could engage w/out thinking about it and forcing myself. Every so often, when a world event or personal event would occur, I'd think, ""I can't wait to call Dad or come home and see what Mom thinks about X or Y. Then it hits you - you can't make that call...you can't go home... I still get that urge at times, even after all those years - and it's always a bit of a gut-punch when I snap back into reality.
   I guess the toughest is when a few years ago, I went through some personal situations (that I'm still struggling w/today even) where I really could've benefited from my parents' thoughts, advice - and just moral support. In lieu of them, I'd just head to the store or bar for a few drinks to just sit alone and think...work up an imaginary conversation w/one or both of them in my mind...thinking about what they might say or suggest. Not really a consolation, but about all I could really do.
   Losing my parents has definitely created a void that will never be filled. It gets easier but something you never fully get over, no matter how old you are or how old you get - in some way you'll always seek that connection w/them...even in death. I think of them every day, miss them every day and can say to anybody who still have one or both of their parents - just please don't take it for granted and make every moment count. You never get them back once they're gone.

That's been my experience, at least.",0
1272,"My mum passed 18 months ago. I held it together for all of the funeral arrangements. Made sure my grandmother was okay, arranged everything for the funeral and wake. I did all of that in a daze. 

Come 6 months later when we were organising her possessions and clearing her house and I was useless. I shut off, ended a long term relationship and withdrew entirely. I didn't get her ashes buried for 6 months after the funeral. I just couldn't function. I left the paperwork and possessions to the rest of my family to deal with. This was when I began to struggle at work.

If you can't be there in this moment, you will be at other times. If you can handle it now but not later, that's okay too. You have to handle it as you can. There is no wrong or right way.

1277,"Lost my dad in 2014, just shy of my sons 1yr birthday. My mom passed in 2017. It completely fucked me up and continues to wreak havoc on me. In some ways it's because I've since found more of a backbone and have started to find my own way. I wasn't really my own person because I lived in the shadow of my parents, and specifically my dad. 

I've had extremely devastating blows as a result. I've committed infidelities, been difficult to get along with, had crippling anxiety and depression (never had either before). My marriage has been broken so many times, and part of that is due to that in many ways I'm just different than I was. I've lost jobs due to my volatility, and had to learn to manage my drinking when I let it get out of control and affect me.

I've also started to find myself. Learn to become my own person. Learn to have boundaries and lines that I won't tolerate (before I would ALWAYS just blow whichever way the wind blew). Tied to make more time for myself, tried to focus on things that actually matter (my son, and step kids, being happy with work and adjusting when it's not satisfying for me), connect better with friends and family that need me. Be advice and support for others going through similar or other issues, and a whole host of other good things too.

My point is to say that sometimes it's just going to totally suck. It will be the worst times you've ever experienced. But can also lead you to the best ones. You'll find out who people are and aren't. You'll learn things about yourself and (if in a relationship) your significant other that will be invaluable for your future.

I'm so sorry for your loss. It is the worst, and I wish every day I could somehow cure them and bring them back. But most days, sad to say, it just isn't top of mind. My life ends up taking up the presence of mind that keeps me going, but I have a family/children that make things busy.

Keep them close in your heart and mind. Remember their favorite sayings and music and whatever. Keep a journal/write if you want, it helps. But most of all, just understand this is YOUR journey, that only you can experience how it will go. Even close siblings won't have the same experience you do because you're you and your relationship with your mom or dad will be different than theirs. Just breathe and know the hard times will be there but you'll get through it.

Hang in there.

Fwiw, I'm 37 now, lost my dad at 30.",0
1278,"I didn’t cry at first when my mother died. I kind of accepted the situation and understood what was happening when the doctor gave us the news and why it was happening. 

Even at the funeral I didn’t cry, I was more annoyed with family at the time. I didn’t wanna be near my family, I wanted to be alone, playing video games or even just hanging out with my friends. It was at that moment I realized that this was my coping mechanism. 

I was always with my family when she died, however I found it to be mentally taxing, however not emotionally. I wanted to hangout with my friends because for a brief moment it made me not think about what was going on at home and enjoy the company of my friends. It just helped relieve some tension off of me. 

It wasn’t till 6 months after my mother’s passing that I found myself crying. I was about to head to bed, then all of a sudden I thought of her, and I just let it all out that night alone in my room. I did feel a lot better afterwards.

As for your situation, you have to find out what works for you. Everyone reacts to death differently and have different coping mechanisms. 

Don’t let other people tell you how you should cope or mourn the loss of your mother. I remember my grandma getting mad at me for leaving a party for my late mother saying that it was rude. I didn’t pay no mind to her but I understood why she would think that. 

To her, that is her way of coping with the loss, having the entire family together. If hanging out with friends helps you mourn then do what you gotta do, but if you also wanna be mindful, I suggest you find the balance to help yourself mourn and others mourn if they need you too. 

Understand that everyone’s reaction to death and how they cope is different and that’s what makes them human. It is part of the human experience tbh.",0
1279,"I'm sorry about your loss. I have an idea of what you are going through. My mom passed away in April. I was furloughed in March and in and out of quarantine, making things much harder for me to process. But, in a weird way, I was stuck with my own thoughts, so I had to face what was going through my head. I didn't have many distractions from those thoughts and no family members to share my grief with. This is not recommended if you can help it. Finding a counselor to talk to can be a great way to unpack your thoughts without getting the monotonous, sympathetic responses your loved ones may give.

I don't think there is an easier way to process it. It just has to happen. In September, I decided to move to a new state and get back to focusing on my own goals. That helped quite a bit. I'm looking forward and keeping busy as much as possible right now. I plan to continue traveling next year and doing everything in my ability to make it happen.

But don't get me wrong. I am still struggling to stay motivated. Some days you just need to give yourself a break. Those days will feel inhibiting, and struggling against it can be very tough. Let those days pass and give yourself a break. The worst thing I've learned is to fight this griefing process. It does not end well, at least for me. 

Find support, treat yourself kindly, and give yourself time to think would be my advice. Find a new hobby, goal, or try something new.

Best of luck to you, stay strong!",0

1281,"I'm sorry for your loss.

My Father died a little over 10 years ago, to be honest that first year was by far the hardest.

Hearing how you describe how you're feeling reminds me a lot of how I felt after he passed away, at first I was in shock, then after that I tried repressing my feelings so that I can be strong for my family.
 
Word of advice, don't repress your feelings, confront them, realize that the person you love has passed away, that they aren't physically there for you to talk to.

I reccomend taking a week to a month off to deal with this pain, to confront your sense of loss, to cry and let it all out; in this time off talk to your mother, for even though she isn't physically with you she'll always be with you in spirit, tell her all that you wish you could've told her in life, tell her all that you wish to tell her in death, let her know how much you miss her and how much you'll miss her.

Regarding your large support group I'll reference a piece of Jewish philosophy regarding this:

Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: 'Do not appease your fellow in the time of his anger; do not console him while his dead lies before him; do not question him about his vow at the time he makes it; and do not attempt to see him at the time of his degradation.'

This piece essentially tells us to leave our friends and loved ones alone in their times of great passion, and to wait to talk to them about it once everything has calmed down.

There is a reason why you feel like you are going to lash out at your co-workers, that's because you very likely will lash out at them, and very likely your friends and family, realize that this is natural after the loss of such a loved one.

After my Father passed away I went to see my doctor as to why I physically don't feel well and he told be that half a year to a year after loosing someone important you'll suffer from extreme depression, depression has plenty of psychological, behavioral, and physical side effects.

Brother, think first about your health, then think about work, I know that in these hard times that's a lot to ask for but in all honesty you need the time to organize your thoughts, likewise you are miserable at your work and you feel live you'll lash out at your co-workers, your performance is definitely going to suffer and if you are lashing out at people in all honesty there is a decent likelihood that you'll get fired, in my opinion it's best to leave whilst you still have a good record than to stay a little longer and get fired.

This is my opinion influenced by my own struggles after my father passed away, I hope that you'll manage through this and know that your mother loves you, and cares about you; don't do any self harm, that never helps in the long run.

If you need anyone to talk to I'm sure that most of not everyone here is willing to take some time to lend their ear.

You got to grieve, it will take time. One thought that drove me, I stepped up my game a lot thinking she brought me into this world, raised me, and she didn't do it so I could be miserable when she was gone.

1283,"I found this post last night, but had to sleep on it to decide exactly if I felt right responding and how I would do so. My mom lost an emotionally and eventually physically grueling 3 year battle with lung cancer in 2017. This year she's officially been gone longer than she was sick, that's a weird pill to swallow.

Reading through some of the comments I see a lot of helpful tips for right now, most important (and probably most prevalent) is to allow yourself to grieve how you grieve. It won't be easy. You will have to set your feelings aside momentarily and deal with ""logistics"" which will fucking suck.

I hope this doesn't come off as crass, but what I wish someone had prepared me for was this stage after the first few months/year or so. It doesn't get *easier* but it definitely changes. At some point, you'll accept this new shitty reality, and you'll learn to live with it. That will happen to you before it happens to others. People aren't comfortable hearing about death, which is a little weird because it's so common. Everyone goes through it, but nobody wants to hear someone else going through it. Yesterday, for the first time since August 19, 2017 when it became reality for me, I less-chalantly referenced my mom's death. I didn't even realize the weight I was carrying until it was gone.  It's also important to note: you'll reach this point at a different time frame than I did, that's the strangest part.

What you're going through is an incredibly personal thing. Unfortunately, nobody can change your situation for you, nobody could feel anything for you, nobody can take anything away for you. This level of individualism in the situation also means nobody can tell you how to handle it. 

I hope any portion of this is beneficial to you at any point. I know every single person who knows about the passing of your mother has already offered, but if you need an anonymous stranger who has no training, please feel free to message me.

To close, I'd like to offer my own version of what everyone else is saying: You're going to get through this. It's going to take the rest of your life, but you're going to get through this.",0

Its very rare for me to find a woman her age attractive to me, in 20 years itll be impossible.

We all enjoyed wrestling but he didnt have the ability to watch the pay per views so we would record it on a vhs on sunday an then drop it off to him on monday. so he wasnt to far behind on what had happen on the show. 

Well we called him to let him know we were coming an he didnt answer. We said what ever an just drove over their anyway. Maybe he wasn't home or something. He was very old school an worked the night shift so maybe he was busy. Anyway we get to his place an i hop out of the SUV tape in hand an knock on his door. No answer. Oh well this has happened a few times before no biggy il just put it between his screen door an the other door. I knocked really loud one more time an me an dad left. 

About half a week or more passes by we dont hear from him which is odd because normally he would call my dad after he watched the show to talk about what had happen but nothing. Radio silence. A week passes an finally we get a call. Apparently he was having like a diabetic coma or something similar to that.  Me knocking on the door to give him the tape startled him just enough to ground himself i guess an he was able to call the paramedics to come get him.  He had been in the hospital the entire week. He thanked us for saving him an then went right back to talking about wrestling. 

He passed years back do to his multiple health complications but he was a really cool dude. really odd but really cool. Miss you big AL",0
1290,"I'm pretty sure I stopped two young women from being kidnapped in the mid-90s.  They were drunk and they were getting sweet-talked by these guys who hung around one of the expatriate social clubs in my neighborhood, that was basically a front and meeting spot for one of the Eastern European criminal gangs.

I was on my way home late at night and I saw these two talking to the guys outside their club.  I read the scene and could just tell with absolute certainty, these girls didn't understand who they were talking to.  Local girls, city girls, would have been on high alert; these two were just giggling and totally loose.  I listened closely and the guys were talking about taking them to some after hours club, and were literally inviting them to get in their big white van.  I mean... if they weren't kidnappers, they sure were going for ""the look.""

I was shit scared, but my spidey sense was blaring and I couldn't just be a passive bystander to this shit.  So I intervened, and they did that act where they're simultaneously intimidating you and pretending to be all wounded that you think they're not good guys, winding up for a fight.  I thought for a minute there I was probably just gonna get stuffed in the van too.  But I kept my cool (outside - inside my nerves were screaming) and just kept saying ""It's not about you, it's about whether anyone should be getting into strange vans at 3am, no offense guys.""  After seeing the guys get all thuggy with me, the girls finally realized they might not be wholesome fellows, and started stepping away.  The dudes let us go, calling me names and shit, and I got the women to a busier road where we could flag them a taxi.  Then I had to navigate a circuitous route to my apartment, staying well the fuck clear of that social club.

I'm not sure what those young women had in store for them if they got in that van, but I'd guess the possible scenarios started at a gang-rape and went sharply downhill from there.  They could have ended up in a dumpster, or sold.",0
1291,"unfortunately, this is something that i've been thinking about fairly recently. in 2019 my dad had a terrible health scare, a few months later the pandemic blew up, and i had a bad case of covid-19, which left me thinking that i could end up dying. it also doesn't help that i'm nearly 30 and i'm at a point where life is no longer how it used to be. i'm not only afraid of dying young, i'm afraid of my parents passing away. 

i realize that it's normal and inevitable, but i wouldn't be able to handle it if my parents were to suddenly pass away. i think i'll eventually reach a point where it'll hurt a lot, but i'll be okay, as long as i have enough emotional support. 

in regards to your situation, i don't think you have to be the only one putting on a brave face for everyone else. you have your brother and your mom, so you can all rely on each other. it won't be easy, but being there for one another and listening will be incredibly helpful.

1292,"When I was a little kid in the early ‘90s, my grandpa owned a total beater of a Toyota pickup. It was the compact model that came in beige, with grey stripe designs down the sides, manual windows and door locks, and no back seats. He commuted about 40 miles each way to work, and that truck always smelled like a combination of dog hair, plumbing work, and stale coffee. I loved that my grandpa owned his own plumbing company, that he and my grandma lived in a very nice house and seemed to have plenty of money, and that he was probably the best-read, most intellectual guy I’ve ever known personally... And yet he continued to drive a tiny, beat-to-hell pickup with 240,000 miles on it, day after day, year after year.

This stirred a not too pleasant memory...

My adventure kind of describes me in a nutshell...always meaning well, not always being able to pull the ""well"" part off. 

My first truck was a silver Mitsubishi. I identified with it and felt like a ""truck guy"". Driving home down the freeway one evening and I see a car on the right shoulder, and some smoke rising from it as I got closer. Truck guy mode kicks in. Friendly, helpful, ready to come to someone's aid PLUS I noticed when I first got it that there is a small, red fire extinguisher under the front seat! 

As I pass and pull over I notice it is a young couple, probably teenaged. She is standing away from the truck looking really scared, he has the hood up and is waving at a fairly good sized blaze with a t-shirt. It's not going well. Luckily, 'Truck Guy' is about to change all that. I throw open my door, reach under the seat, grab the extinguisher and start jogging toward their car. Help is on the way.

 Young chick notices me and her face lights up with hope! I start fumbling with the extinguisher, noting for the first time that the small red tube has a twisty arm on the side but no nozzle. To my horror I realize that it doesn't have a nozzle because it is a TIRE JACK. I feel numb. I stop, turn around and go back to my truck and drive away in shame. In my rear view the girl is still looking at me, the guy has backed away because the fire is getting out of control. 

The lesson here, a truck doesn't make you a truck guy. And to my knowledge, no one has ever put a car fire out with a tire jack.",0
1294,"So I was on my way to pick this girl up for a date. On my way there I have to take the country roads, so I’m going there, and I’m already late bc my dad needed to air the tires.(I was 17 and it was his truck) 

I’m going down the road and there’s a guy going probably not even 5 under the speed limit but I was wanting to go 5 over. So I go to pass, and this is one of my first times passing so I kinda go a bit easy on the pedal. I get beside him I see headlights in the distance, so I just gun it. 

By the time I get back in the lane I’m going 80! And I look behind me and the guy I passed is now tailgating me! If I wasn’t on my way somewhere I was super tempted to just stomp on my brake but I didn’t want my night or my dads truck ruined, Soon he passes me and turns out he also lived in the same neighborhood as this girl and we both got to our destination at about the same time. 

Idk what’s up with people and passing but it’s like, you can be passed and not have your ego ruined but maybe that guy thought I was trying to show off (which btw we had the same truck) but we had like 350 HP at fucking most so just bc my truck sounded loud doesn’t mean it’s some high performance",0

1301,"Movies never portray that sort of thing right when comes to either guys or girls. That could be considered rape not sexual harassment bit movies tend to portray guys as always wanting sex regardless of the situation. 

The consent thing in a relationship is each their own. I personally feel like if I'm in a relationship then than go ahead and try but I'm personally not always going to in the mood to wake up like that so it's going to be a day by day basis. If I wake to it and ask you stop or say I'm not in the mood than take it as such. Same goes for my partner if I wake up frisky and try to start something and am told no than I need to stop. If we were to try and do things entirely by consent planning for something like that it we would have to ask each other every night before we pass out and that still might not stand the next day.",0

1303,"Personally, speaking only for myself, I would feel violated, I would be outraged, and I would react to it just like I would any other rape, probably violently. 

Someone would have to already be in a pretty deep relationship with me before it would be even slightly passable to assume consent. 

Personally though, I am not willing to sleep in the same bed as someone I'm not in that kind of relationship with. I'd sleep on the floor first. I hate and despise easily avoidable miscommunication, and sleeping in the same bed as someone you have no intention of having sexual relations with, in my personal view, sends too many mixed signals. 

I don't want to victim shame anyone, so please understand that I am speaking only for myself, and not for anyone else or their circumstances. With that in mind, if I did find myself in the situation in the OP somehow, after I reacted, I would probably also feel guilty for myself for having allowed the opportunity for that situation to arise.",0

1305,"Yeah, leave it to Netflix to promote sexual abuse, because Cuties wasn't enough...

Your original question is skirting a line: In a happy relationship, I'd always classify that as a good natured try at least.

Passed out from alcohol and with a stranger, that's pretty much rape, regardless of gender - and yes, you can totally rape a guy without ""violating"" him. An erection is a reflex, not a choice.

The missus and I both have to evaluate it based on mood.  And even when we don't like it, we still appreciate the effort - and encourage it, because there are times we like it. For the times we don't, we just go to the bathroom and have cuddle sex afterwards.",0
1306,"It has kind of happened to me before when I was passed out drunk at a party.  I woke up to a BJ from a female friend.  I wasn't attracted to her at all (she was not a looker) and had turned her down previously.  I didn't stop her though.  At first I felt kind of violated, but I could have made it stop at any moment if I really wanted to.  So I don't think of it as rape.  To be honest I found the scenario pretty hot which, other than being drunk, is why I let it continue.  After that night she still kept trying to hook up and eventually wore me down and I had sex with her.  She eventually became a FWB ( best sex ever) and I eventually became sexually attracted to her because there's just something hot about being the object of someone's desire and fulfilling that desire.  That's just me though.  A court of law would disagree I'm sure.",0
1307,Sounds nasty. What if she has stds or is not on bc or I don't know the answers to these questions why is she in my bed if she is not my wife how did she get in my house why doesn't my alarm system work properly how did she get passed the electric fence and attack dogs,0
1308,"I want my partner ALL the time. Like... literally alllllll the time. She basically has a pass to do whatever she wants whenever she wants if it strikes her fancy. 

That said, she knows this and has heard me say it. She knows I’m always down to be intimate with her. If it were early on in the relationship or before we talked about it and she tried that, I’d count that as a red flag. It’s all about communication. I also know if it ever happened to me with her and I was uncomfortable about it, she’d listen to me and respect me.",0
1309,"Hmm as a man whos woken up to the same thing after being drunk, i still cant explain it. I didnt mind either. It was definitely rape but it was like i just didn't care. Its kind of like the ""stay off my lawn"" for men ... some men dont like trespassers but in reality its not usually a huge deal. For women its like a home invasion, someones broken in a door basically....no one likes that or allows that and thinks its not a big deal.",0

Unless you communicate with the dude beforehand and know for sure that he’ll be down for it it’s rape. If you’re sure and you do it and he wasn’t actually down for it it’s still rape. We live in a gender equal society. Just think gender reversed and go from there,0
1312,"If it’s not something you’ve agreed to it’s rape, as a guy who had this happen I can say that it was not okay. My ex girlfriend and I had an open relationship and she was good friends with the girl I was seeing, after we broke it off my ex and her were still friends and she would come crash after they’d go out drinking. One night while I was passed out on cold medicine they were out and came back to our place and all I remembered from that night was someone trying to take my pants off and trying to get me to touch them sexually. The next morning though my ex was in the guest bedroom with a girl she was talking to and the girl I had just broken it off with was on the couch. Turns out she thought it was okay to get in bed with me and try to get me to have sex with her, she saw nothing wrong with it and when I confronted her she said any guy would be lucky to be woken up like that. It’s not okay, regardless of what you might be in, it’s never okay.",0
1313,"My girlfriend and I mentioned it to each other. Now we both know it's all good. Worst case we'll stop the other if something is up. No biggie

1314,"Maybe I'm wierd... But if I started the night by sleeping in the same bed with a female friend I wouldn't be opposed to the idea and would probably welcome it. There's too much what if and unknown to make a decision. Did I pass out? Was I fully clothed? what was I sleeping in. what was she sleeping in. I'm assuming we both made the decision to sleep in the same bed. I wouldn't wear the same things to bed if I wasn't interested... Why because if i wasn't interested in her I wouldn't want her to easily see my morning wood or if I got hard in my sleep, too risky. So again, if I willingly put myself in the same bed at the start of the night, than ya, probably OK with it.",0
1315,"Id say AT THE VERY LEAST there should be something established between you before you try sth without explicit verbal consent.

If you're a couple and this is a thing that you've discussed then that's cool. However, disucssing it beforehand can also kind of ruin the surprise. So, if the two people have an established sexual relationship then I can give more of a pass to not call it straight up rape, although some people might.

Guys don't want sex literally all the time with anyone. Experiencing a situation where a woman wouldn't take my no for an answer until I had to physically pull her off of me was very eye opening. I don't know how it's not considered more of a problem than it already is.",0

1317,"Couple things come to mind, first is that in high school I was raped multiple times (I’m a male) on completely separate occasions (at least 3 or 4) where a girl would come in to my room after a party where I was passed out intoxicated and literally start having sex with me when I was black out drunk. I would basically come to and recognize that someone was riding me but really not remember much else. This is slightly different since I was inebriated and not just asleep but it’s similar. And from those instances it just kinda irks me when women talk about the female sex as being the only ones who suffer from this. I know it’s a male dominated society but when they treat me like I don’t have the right to even talk on the subject because of my sex when it has happened to me multiple times. And from the males perspective they often have this air that would indicate I was basically lucky to have had those situations occur, but I didn’t ask those girls to come into my bed and take advantage of me. I could have done without that happening and only remember those situations in flashes. But I will say on that matter, I am not super broken up about it. And I don’t hold it against those girls either insofar as I’d want to track them down and bring their actions to light in any way. While what they did was immoral, I honestly hope they got what they needed out of it and are now good honest people contributing to society and all of that. I just get irritated when the subject comes up and I’m treated like I’m the oppressor just because of my sex when it has happened to me multiple times. 


Anyway on the matter of just being asleep. To me trust has got to be the bedrock for any committed relationship, and that’s the only one where this would likely occur at this point in my life. This only happened on one occasion I know of and it‘s kinda funny. I’m really bad most mornings before I get out of bed and will do everything to keep sleeping. So apparently she had tried to do this, give me a BJ to wake me up. But I just kept sleeping and wouldn’t budge. She apparently kept trying but I would just push her away and groan and roll over, and maybe even was acting irritated. But I honestly don’t remember any of it at all. When she told me, she was the one who was annoyed, and I was the one being apologetic because in my waking state I was thinking ‘awe man I always want bjs!’ But I was probably just really tired and like I said when I’m asleep my unconscious self will do literally everything to stay asleep.


But anyway, to me, sexual favors are just that. Favors. I love sex and I’ll take it just about any time I can if it’s with someone I love or feel a strong affection for that is mutual and established. So in those circumstances no, I don’t consider it rape. But I think you kinda know when it is, like even after a one night stand there are still rules of engagement when you’re first getting to know someone. And they owe it to you to at least wake you up with some cuddling and foreplay and a fair warning instead of just going straight for it. However again, in a committed relationship where the rules and understanding has been established, no I don’t think it’s rape at all. We owe it to each other to give some leeway when there’s trust which basically means, if you’re giving me a blowjob before I wake up it’s because you want to do something nice for me. You always have my best interests in mind and even if it’s not something I really want (it is) I at least owe it to you to treat it like a fluke and not get all bent out of shape.",0

A few minutes later my boyfriend woke up and my friend goes “I told her I sucked your cock,” my boyfriend says “yea it was a poor performance on my part.” Again I laugh thinking they were making a joke. 

When we got in the car my boyfriend starts describing how my friend while on FaceTime with someone came in the room we were passed out in and takes out his dick and starts to suck it. My boyfriend goes “I didn’t know what to do so I just pretended I was still asleep and rolled over”
I was like “ wait that actually happened!!!!” I was livid.

1329,I have told my wife: do not wake me up for sex. I don't sleep well. If I'm woken up before I'm ready to wake up I am *incredibly* grumpy. I am not up for it and there will be a dangerous amount of passive aggressive sighing.,0
1330,"that's why I didn't report it. She was a friend of mine, came out lesbian that same day she assaulted me, she even dated my best friend, but looking back had a history of picking up men who were extremely intoxicated. She also had PTSD, a bunch of other issues, was not as strong as me, and I could easily see this going back against me.

I remember letting her spend the night since we were very drunk and she was in no position to drive. I also was okay with drunk cuddles since I don't receive much physical affection and had finally gotten comfortable cuddling with my female friends. None of them pushed past it in the past. So everything done prior to this would make it seem like I was the aggressive one. I passed out and at some point I woke up in the middle of the night as she was trying to remove my clothes. I told her to stop because I did not want to have sex and that we should just go back to sleep. I remembered she had herpes and I wasn't attracted to her in that way, plus she's my best friends ex. Then a little later she was going for it again but got a lot further. Out of fear and shock I literally flipped her off of me and pinned her down and told her nothing was going to happen. Apparently when I did that her arm hit something and she had started bleeding. I literally just ran out of my room and locked myself in the bathroom still super drunk and fell asleep in the bathtub. I kicked her out the next morning. i didn't tell her anything besides she had to leave. 

I was scared. I didn't want to report or do anything because I didn't know if anything had happened and she was the only one with any injuries. I paid for all our drinks that night because she was broke so if anything it would appear like I was trying to get her drunk. When I did tell a couple of friends they all were ragging on me for not letting her take my virginity away and it wasn't until I told them I knew she had herpes that they started taking it seriously. No one told me I should report it. Two actually blamed me for leading her on even though she literally came out as lesbian at the beginning of the night and thought it was safe. 

It sucked cause I didn't want to go out with her that night but felt like I owed her since she helped me the day I was feeling suicidal by going on a walk with me at 4 am a year prior. So it sucked having to go through with it. I had just started opening myself up physically with people too and I shut back down. It's taken me years but I'm warming back up but that shit scares me. She started going off on me when I wasn't responding back to her messages and she started a couple rumors too. BTW This took place in a small private uni too.

I'm better now but fuck that was scary. I'm clean from herpes so as far as I'm concerned I woke up just in time.",0
1331,I’m just talking about me personally here. I would be fine. Happy in most scenarios. But I cannot fathom why I would sleep in a bed(other than with my children) with a person who I didn’t want to have sex with. Sober or not. If I’m not interested I’m not going to the bed. I’ll pass out on the living room floor before I share a bed with someone I’m not interested in.,0
1332,"I'm merely saying it isn't always black and white.  That's it.  I know it's possible to distinguish consent without verbal communication; I used that example to show that there is a spectrum.  At the top is verbal consent, body language etc, past encounters etc.  That spectrum is affected by things like alcohol.  It could be kinks.  It could be feeling pressure to have sex, something yiu see regularly posted here by couples that feel they have to have sex.  Or like that person said, drugs.  I've done plenty of stupid shit on alcohol or drugs, most people have.

On this spectrum is getting woken by a blowjob.  Some people don't wait for 20years of marriage to take that plunge.  Some assume that it will be ok judging by all the indications, sometimes that decision will be wrong - just like OP.  However the guy doesn't seem that bothered by it so I don't really know how that squares up.  Is that extreme passivity and consensual retrospectively?  Does he feel like he was raped?  Or is his idea of what is acceptable a little different from yours and mine because of his experiences.  

Pretending it isnt sometimes complicated serves no purpose, and taking agency away from him and superimposing your standards of rape makes little sense.

By the definition of rape, anyone ever woken by a blowjob has been raped.  They couldn't consent, they were asleep.  Consent the night before is acceptable? Because it's happened 100 times before, is it safe to say the 101st time is consensual?

If the speed of traffic for example is 75mph and some ding dong hops on the free way and jumps all the way over to the left to do 65mph it not only cause a bunch of cars to have to hit the brakes but it also causes a small portion of these drivers to drive more recklessly to get around the slower driver, thus causing more accidents. A friend of mines dad has been a highway patrol officer for 25 years and he said if he had to guess he’d say 80-90% of car accidents on the free way are caused because people are trying to get around a slow driver that is lingering in the passing lane.

My routine has 2 upper body, 2 lower body, 2 active rest day or cardio days, and a full rest day (nothing over warm up and stretch).

I write it out in a small notepad because if I pick up my phone I'll get distracted and lose the cardio benefit of lifting quickly. Compound lifts save time. Squat, deadlift, overhead press, and pull ups will work every muscle you have. I include core specific exercises on all lift days. Running or other cardio after lifting usually in an interval of run x distance walk x distance. That said, weight loss happens in the kitchen. You don't have to cut down to chicken breast and brown rice. If your current weight is stable, you can find a way to cut a couple hundred calories and see gains. Watch for calories you drink soda, juice, etc. They add up very quickly. Also, when you eat is it because you're bored or actually hungry. Dehydration can present as hunger as well. You don't have to count specifically but every couple weeks swap something you usually eat out for a healthier option. Trying to change the way you eat suddenly and dramatically is a way people fall off quickly.

First, this is actually a legit source. Literally the first time that's happened on reddit. Usually, people toss research done by church groups at me. I appreciate you using a reasonable source!

Second, what you said is:

>There is scientific evidence that you do actually need sex.

Based on my admittedly limited understanding of medical terminology and only being able to see the abstract, what this article seems to be saying is that the lower the frequency if sex, the higher your risk of cardiovascular ""events"", like heart attacks **may** be.

I'd be curious to see how a lack of cardiovascular activity, antioxidants, or vegetables would have on one's likelihood of a cardiovascular event.

Third, the conclusion is as follows - I've bolded a word or two for emphasis):

>Decreased sexual frequency correlated with higher homocysteine levels in a nationally representative sample of US adults, especially men; this **might** increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or other atherothrombotic events.

So......Id be interested in specifics -- does it have to be sexual intercourse? What about heavy petting? Mutual masturbation? Solo masturbation?

My advice is if Finasteride does not work, rogaine probably wont either. If you have the means, talk to a doctor to jump right to that. Grafts aren't worth it, not right now.

They get me to the hospital, do the scans, stays, blood draws, administer fentanyl for my pain and then I'm just left there. For 4 hours with no one there. The nurses only briefly checking in on me.

Left to stew in my fentanyl amplified emotions, I was terrified, alone, angry, sad beyond words, and worst of all, broken. I thought my artery had torn open and so did the doc initially until they got images. I earnestly thought I was going to die and it would be alone. I'm slowly recovering from it physically.

1471,"Hey everyone, 

Just got a simple question as I have went through this and am still having troubles. I know I always will, but the days as of late have been very dark. 

Short story: Dad died suddenly when I was 18. Had heart surgery 3 years prior. It was like a sextuple or 6 bypass I believe. He was a very lucky guy. He delivered trucks for Ford and traveled up to Iowa(I live in Missouri) and passed away in his truck. I found out while I was at college 3 hours from home and drove back immediately. Since then I have had no care for anything and I myself have changed.

Had a GF for 4 years, but that no longer exists and any friends I used to have don't talk to me anymore I have pushed away. I won't talk to my mom about it because let's be honest it just isn't the same. I'm very stubborn I know, but I also don't really want to see a councilor(spelling?) because I don't want someone to pretend to care about my situation. I want them to actually relate with me and give me advice or something. I'm not very tolerant of other people and by that I guess I don't sympathize very well. I have a hard time feeling anything especially sympathy and I hate it. For example, someone asks me to say something nice about them and I would say, ""My opinion shouldn't matter. The only thought that should matter is that of yourself."" Now, I completely agree with that for the most part, but I used to never do things like that. I would be the guy that would like and make a person feel good about themselves. I miss that guy. That guy had a willpower to want to be better. 

So, redditors or anyone really, share your story with me, or give me some advice on how to get better than I am currently.",0

I would ask her if she wanted me to come over and she would just answer please. Nothing more. I would say be there in a few. I would get dressed, drive to her house, shed let me in. We would just go back to her room, sit/lay on the bed, and I would just wrap my arms around her and hold her close. We wouldnt say a word, there was nothing that needed to be said as it had all been said already. This was in my upperclassmen years of high schools. Her parents were perfectly fine with it and my parents never knew since I usually stayed in my room when at home, making virtually no noise. I didnt even make noise when walking, earning me the nickname ghost from my own family.

I loved her, more than what I thought possible. She loved me. We never did anything about it because of both of our medical issues and in all honesty, probably to protect each other. Instead we were just there for each other in ways that no one else could. We were always there for each other no matter what. She was there the very next day  after I found out my ex was cheating on me while I was in the ICU following spinal fusion surgery.

It feels like someone has ripped out my heart, my stomach. It feels like I have a fist in my throat. I feel empty,  and weak. I cant go to her funeral. I cant go to her funeral. I cant go to the funerals of those I love most because I cannot see the faces of those I love and see them dead, I cant have that be my last memory of them. I couldnt go to the funeral of the by far most influential man in my life, my grandfather, the man that taught me everything.

She had a friend of hers post a letter after she had passed and I got it. It hurt so much to read, I cant find the words to accurately describe how it made me feel. I had resolved to do the exact same thing should something ever happen so that I have final word on how I go out rather than let something else make that decision for me, so I would have that final act of mine, that last thing to happen to, to be of my own decision and to choose my own fate, rather than have it be chosen for me. I never once told her this though, it was even the exact same method. She did everything the exact same way that I would.

I want her back. I want to feel her in my arms, to smell her hair, to hear her laugh, to feel her breath on my neck, to see her smile. 

I dont know what to do. Help. Please...


Edit: as if to make things worse my chronic pain is having another spike so im laying on the ground, too weak and in too much pain to stand, waiting for my pain killers to kick in... thank god she never saw me like this. She never saw me when the pain was bad...

When I say I dont trust others, I really mean it. I dont even trust either of my parents enough to ever give more than banal chit chat. I never reveal anything serious to them anymore because of how they responded in the past when I tried talking with them about anything serious in my life.



I just want someone to hold me...",0
1473,"Saw this trending recently, and my thinking has started to shift lately:

https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/10/why-i-hope-to-die-at-75/379329/

> ""Seventy-five. That is all I want to live. But if I am not going to engage in euthanasia or suicide, and I won’t, is this all just idle chatter? Don’t I lack the courage of my convictions?

> No. My view does have important practical implications. ...

> Once I have lived to 75, my approach to my health care will completely change. I won’t actively end my life. But I won’t try to prolong it, either. Today, when the doctor recommends a test or treatment, especially one that will extend our lives, it becomes incumbent upon us to give a good reason why we don’t want it. The momentum of medicine and family means we will almost invariably get it.

> My attitude flips this default on its head. I take guidance from what Sir William Osler wrote in his classic turn-of-the-century medical textbook, The Principles and Practice of Medicine: “Pneumonia may well be called the friend of the aged. Taken off by it in an acute, short, not often painful illness, the old man escapes those ‘cold gradations of decay’ so distressing to himself and to his friends.”

> My Osler-inspired philosophy is this: At 75 and beyond, I will need a good reason to even visit the doctor and take any medical test or treatment, no matter how routine and painless. And that good reason is not “It will prolong your life.” I will stop getting any regular preventive tests, screenings, or interventions. I will accept only palliative—not curative—treatments if I am suffering pain or other disability.

> This means colonoscopies and other cancer-screening tests are out—and before 75. If I were diagnosed with cancer now, at 57, I would probably be treated, unless the prognosis was very poor. But 65 will be my last colonoscopy. No screening for prostate cancer at any age. (When a urologist gave me a PSA test even after I said I wasn’t interested and called me with the results, I hung up before he could tell me. He ordered the test for himself, I told him, not for me.) After 75, if I develop cancer, I will refuse treatment. Similarly, no cardiac stress test. No pacemaker and certainly no implantable defibrillator. No heart-valve replacement or bypass surgery. If I develop emphysema or some similar disease that involves frequent exacerbations that would, normally, land me in the hospital, I will accept treatment to ameliorate the discomfort caused by the feeling of suffocation, but will refuse to be hauled off.

> What about simple stuff? Flu shots are out. Certainly if there were to be a flu pandemic, a younger person who has yet to live a complete life ought to get the vaccine or any antiviral drugs. A big challenge is antibiotics for pneumonia or skin and urinary infections. Antibiotics are cheap and largely effective in curing infections. It is really hard for us to say no. Indeed, even people who are sure they don’t want life-extending treatments find it hard to refuse antibiotics. But, as Osler reminds us, unlike the decays associated with chronic conditions, death from these infections is quick and relatively painless. So, no to antibiotics.

> Obviously, a do-not-resuscitate order and a complete advance directive indicating no ventilators, dialysis, surgery, antibiotics, or any other medication—nothing except palliative care even if I am conscious but not mentally competent—have been written and recorded. In short, no life-sustaining interventions. I will die when whatever comes first takes me.""",0
1474,"Hey guys, I just found out that my father (45) has to get bypass surgery done. They caught it early and the doctor says everything should be fine. He's healthy, works out regularly (work requirement) and eats fairly healthy thanks to my stepmom (she's a nurse). My grandfather had to get a quadruple bypass done in his 60's before we lost him. So what can I as a 24 year old guy do to mitigate my risk as much as possible since I definitely have a family history of heart disease. ",0
1475,"When I grew up, I was the fat kid. Kids would make fun of me all the time. I hated school from the very start. 

When I started High school I became even bigger. I had no idea what a proper diet was, and I eventually weighed over 300 pounds. 

Around this time, a lot was happening. My friends (I was able to make a few good friends somehow) and other guys my age were getting girlfriends. I didn’t. I found that the few girls that had any attention for me at all treated me like a friend. At the time (and all the way up until now) they would talk around me like I was another one of the girls, e.g. about guys they found attractive, hygiene stuff, basically things that indicate that in no way do they consider me someone they would like to go out with. I will leave high school without ever having sex or a girlfriend.

The teasing continued. As I was bigger than I ever was, I found out that people couldn’t care less about what kind of person I was on the inside; the outside was all that mattered. I had teachers try to be discreet and ask me if I had a medical problem which caused me to be big, occasionally cars would stop and people yell out abuse at me. 

Also, I had a nerve issue with my stomach which had me in nearly constant pain for my last year of school. Academically, I was okay and I managed to scrape by to get to higher education.

The years go by.

I work terrible jobs until I go to higher education. I go into a field of work I hate and I have now to start over again at 28 when I have hardly any money. It will take years to get into what I am thinking about doing, if I even do as it is competitive.

Women ignore me. I know how it reads, but bear with me. I read and hear from others that when someone is interested in you, then they make some eye contact and other signs (I look up books on body language and study the material). I get none of that from women. I get looked past and looked through. All of my friends get girlfriends; a good number of them were initially approached by the women, I can see how they flirt with one another.

Eventually, I decide to lose weight. I have no idea why it took me so long (this haunts/puzzles me even now, maybe it was because I had been fat all my life?). I have no idea what I am doing so I join Weight Watchers. As a 23 something old man it was really great for my ego that, while other guys were going to parties and having sex, I was standing in line with 30 or so women in their late forties to be weighed. After a year or so doing this, I take up the gym and lifting etc.

Throughout, what kept me going was the fantasy. It sounds stupid and pathetic now but while I was doing this, I thought about how awesome it would be to become really attractive as a result of weight loss. I would have a good body and look great, women would be attracted to me, guys would rate me and I would count for a change. I soon found that what happened was, at 180 pounds, I had a less than attractive face and loose skin as a result. I was shattered. Years of effort and sacrifice for goddam nothing. Sure, I wasn’t going to have a heart attack now but that’s hardly a win for a 28 year old. All that can possible help the skin is bulking/cutting cycles (body building for the un-initiated), but even then it will never be okay. I could get surgery, but it leaves a massive scar and costs so much money (insurance doesn’t cover cosmetic stuff) that I will never be able to afford it. My face can’t be fixed, the features are strange and my head is a weird shape too.

So here I am now.

28, virgin, poor, body is permanently disfigured, unattractive, and years of depression have all but broken my mind. I have no career, will have to go back and study again, and don’t know if I can afford it. I have started to bulk and have put on too much weight to boot, so am overweight again as well. In addition, I haven’t been able to lose weight like I used to as I am trying to preserve muscle, but I have to keep lowering calories because I have the world’s worst metabolism.

Women still ignore me, and talk around me like I am one of their girlfriends. I know who all the men that the women think are attractive in the office, they put on deodorant and talk about all the random hook-ups they have had. In public, I get no eye contact or any other interaction.

However, I am a good conversationalist and not shy or anything somehow. I can make people laugh and hold a room. But somehow this confidence isn’t the right kind of confidence, I don’t know. 

Depression seems to have me. It comes up like a wave and it breaks on the centre of my chest. Then negative thoughts move through my mind like storm fronts, sometimes they hit so hard that I forget about my senses and surroundings and become the thoughts. A lot of the time I have the harsh truths running through:

No one desires you
No one loves you
No one has ever desired you
No one has ever loved you
No one will ever desire you
No one will ever love you
You are ugly
You are a freak (your skin and your history)
You have missed out on so much, you will never be the guy experiencing things for the first time with someone in the same situation as you, and you have no romantic history, all those years just burnt away, all that potential gone that you can never get back
No one will ever understand this; no one will ever respect you like they would if you had lived like they did
No one has ever been attracted to you
You are defective; all kinds of bad men have women attracted to them, you aren’t the greatest guy but far from the worst
You are a punch line to every shitty joke; people at your age without any real experience with the opposite sex are like 5% of the population 
You have more in common with teenagers then people your own age, they have families and careers while you have nothing and no one
In every way you can think of, you are a failure as a man
There is no getting over this or past it; my whole life has been wrapped around everything
Stop trying; anything you get from this point is only a shadow of what it could have been if things had been ok at the start

After this stuff, more often than not, the anger comes. A lot of this doesn’t make rational sense but it is the feeling that grips at me.

Why should I even try anymore? Apart from my immediate family, why should I have any obligation to the world when it has rejected me? I have always been on the bottom of the pile in everything. 

The inner anger and bitterness often comes when I see other people and their love. They carry on with all their activities and their celebrations, milestones, niceties etc. Its not FOR YOU, you don't count, you're not whats wanted.

Last stop in the road is tiredness. I feel tired all the time.

Tired of being unwanted 
Tired of working to be normal when I know I won’t ever be able to get there
Tired of going to the gym and getting nowhere
Tired of others around me finding happiness
Tired of failure
Tired of dealing with my thoughts
Tired of trying mindfulness and being useless at it
Tired of pretending to be someone with some romantic experience 
Tired of having no one
Tired of trying

I’m really sick of trying and I don’t know how much longer I can keep pretending to be someone I’m not, I don’t know how much longer I can cope with everything being wrong and broken and ugly. I am desperately trying not to be bitter with everything, but its so hard no to. Its so hard not to have negative feelings towards people and things in general when things have been like this for so long.


I go to the gym, I attend counselling i can't really afford (have hardly any money at the moment).

But its not working, I just want to give up.

Has anyone been this shit at life and turned it around?

1476,"About two years ago I started dating my boyfriend after meeting him at work (he is a consultant contracted to another company). We were dating for about a year and he was an absolutely amazing boyfriend. We had a great relationship except for the fact that he was working a lot. 

I was too immature to just straight up tell him that I was feeling neglected instead, I started acting out for attention. I told him that there is this cute guy at my work that keeps on hitting on me. He told me, that he’d hit on me too if I worked there too. I wasn’t really getting the reaction I was expecting I was hoping he’d get a bit jealous or something.

We ended up getting into a fight later because I brought up the other guy. A lot of things were said but it was basically the idea that I felt that he wasn’t willing to fight for my love. It always felt like he was ready to walk out. I wanted him to get jealous at least so I knew he cared for me. I know looking back I was immature and stupid but that is what caused us to break up.

After that we would talk to each other time to time nothing serious. I never did anything with the my coworker after we broke up.

About 3 months ago I ended up getting into a car accident. I ended up hurting my spine and since then I have having tons of medical problems. My family couldn’t help me much and so my friends were the ones that were checking up on me. I was injured to the point where I couldn’t stand for too long, and wasn’t allowed to work. Friends would often help take me to my appointments and checkups. One day I couldn’t find anyone so I called my ex-bf he ended up taking me there. 

He found out that I really had no one to help me out so he offered to start taking me to my doctor’s appointments and started bringing over food. I started to fall for him again; he was just so compassionate and caring I started rethinking everything. He started spending more and more time at my apartment to help me out that he practically was living with me. 

I asked him about us, and if we were going to get back together. And then he told me that he cares for another girl. I was heart broken to hear this I asked him who it was he said he met a girl online that he really cares about. I started asking him for details.

He found this 20 year old girl from England that he is going to be seeing in a year as soon as his job lets out. He tells me that he has never felt this way about a girl in his life, he says they talk/videocalls to each other at least 2 hours a day and text each other. He tells me how they send each other presents and that the bracelet he is wearing was a gif that she made for him. I was about to cry because I thought he was helping me because he wanted to get back together.

I told that it’s great for him, he could tell me that I was upset, he came up and comforted me and got me to stop crying.

Since this incident, I just feel so bad everyday he is so nice to me making me food taking me places after he comes back from work because I have been sitting around the house all day. Everything he does makes me love him more and more and I can’t have him : (. I don’t even understand how he found this girl from what I know he doesn’t have any online dating profiles. 

I keep on thinking why would such an attractive girl be online dating if she doesn’t have some problems of her own. I don’t even know he found her since he never spends any time online. He is a good looking guy and gets a good bit of attention from women here so why was he online dating to begin with? 

I don’t understand how he can be so kind and compassionate when we broke up on such bad terms.
I am really hoping that she isn’t what he expects and he comes back to me. I know it’s selfish and I don’t deserve him but I feel so bad : (.  

I have been getting better, I recently had surgery and my exbf is going to move back to his place. He told me that if I ever need anything that he is there for me. 

**Tl-DR – Boyfriend and I break up. I end up getting into a car accident exbf spends a lot of time taking care of me. I think he wants to get back together with me, turns out he has an online gf that he is going to meet. I am in love with him and want to get back with him**

**Edit 1**- I am not trying to break things up with him and the English girl I legitimately think it's not going to work out. I just want to know what I can do so I can be there for him when he gets back 

What can I do to get him back? Do you think his relationship with this other girl work out? Why would he be so nice to me if he said he didn’t want to get back together?

1477,"So i am 24 years old, healthy, it's not courant in my family but sometimes rarely when i am in my bubble this comes up in my mind and i get a small bubble in my stomach thinking about it. Statistics don't lie and a lot of men end up having at least 1 heart attack in their life and i think it is very scary.

I was wondering if you guys get this thought sometimes.",0
1478,"I've tried r/fitness, r/weightroom, r/bodyweightfitness, r/bodybuilding, and probably a couple others but my posts keep being removed instantly. Not sure why, tried rewording and all that but whatever.

Anyways, I'm 29, 6' at 320lbs. I want to both lose weight, but strengthen by body. Nowhere close to the direction of body builder or anything, I just want to be in shape and my muscles to be strong enough to support my bones, joints, and everything else that hurts most of the time for no real reason.

For weight loss, my main obstacle is my motivation and lack of self control. I know how to diet, I know cardio and a caloric deficit are really the two main things for melting the body fat off.  I'm not necessarily asking in regards to this but I'm totally open to anything you're willing to share.

&#x200B;

However, weights I don't even know where to begin. I'm going to just list a bunch of random questions I have and hopefully some of you can shed some light.

&#x200B;

\- Are all the fancy machines in a gym worth using, or are there really just a couple that are best? I use the treadmill and stair thing (elliptical?) for cardio. But I'm not sure how many of the other contraptions are more useful than others.

\- Of course I hear jokes about not skipping leg day forever at this point, but is that actually a thing? You do different body parts on different days? I guess that makes sense because whenever I do some weights my arms are \*super\* sore for days afterwards.

\- How hard should I be pushing myself? Should I be lifting the absolute max weight I can, resulting in a lower count? Or is it better to do a little less weight if it means I can keep lifting it for longer periods of time?

\- Second part to that, given that I am so over weight and very sedentary (gamer with a career in IT), how do I keep myself from overdoing it? I.e., I really want to change my body, but I have a fear of working myself into a heart attack or something.

\- Should I be waiting for the soreness to go away before working that body part again? I don't want to over do it and end up pulling or straining something and it be detrimental to my efforts. I have to imagine that the more I do this, the less time they'll feel sore anyway.",0
1479,"So a bit of background. I got out of a very serious, year+ long relationship earlier this year. She ghosted me. Somewhere along the line I figure she cheated on me because I caught something that has probably made me unable to have kids and she's the only one I've been with. I then got sued by her exhusband. I have a one night stand with her when she discoveredI was being sued. I discover that she probably ghosted me for a guy I'm fairly certain is a trust fund baby and is LOADED. She refuses to speak to me after this. I almost FUCKING DIED of a stress induced heart attack. Exhusband finally dropped the lawsuit. I tell her. She tells me she's thinking about selling her house that I helped her buy and setup a very robust alarm and CCTV system in at great personal expense to protect her from exhusband and moving in with this guy. My friend figures out and tells the new BF that she probably cheated on him with me when we had our one night stand. I get a very angry phone call. They're still together, because apparently he's as dumb as I am.


I'm heartbroken all over again and all I can think is how much I still love her I want her back even though I know we had a God awful relationship and that this woman is TOXIC AS FUCK.

So does anyone have amy advice on how I can heal, and try to deal with this.",0

I (M35) have just found out that my father has been accused of raping a child that I know. He will go on trial later this year.

He has always been an excellent father to me, I love him and I can't believe he would do this, but I also can't believe that the child would lie about this since going to court will be massively traumatic for them too.

I don't live near them (and Coronavirus has shut down travel in my country) so from a distance I'm trying to support my mother, who is so distraught I'm worried she will have a heart attack or something. I'm also trying to support my father, because if he is innocent then I cannot fathom how gruelling this is for him. And if he's guilty then our justice system and everyone else on the planet will take care of punishing him.

But I feel like I'm going a bit batshit myself, because I simply have no idea if I should feel sorry for him or be disgusted by him, and I flipflop between feeling incredibly sad and feeling burning rage.

It's extra cutting because I would like to have a child myself, but I'm gay and my long-term partner isn't interested in kids, so I was already feeling down about that but was on the way to accepting it. Now I feel like my whole family is destroyed.

I send my mother messages daily and she says they keep her going, but some days I just feel so sick about the whole thing that I want to cut myself away from it completely - like when someone dumps you and you cut all ties and block them so that you can get over them and move on.

How can I support my parents through this ordeal without it destroying my own mental health?",0
1481,"[According to the CDC, men are twice as likely to binge drink as women, and they drink more often on average, and more likely to be hospitalized for alcohol related injuries.](https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/mens-health.html) [Drinking is a cause of cancer and heart problems](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/diet-physical-activity/alcohol-use-and-cancer.html), so its really in the interest of society to reel this problem in, in my opinion. After all, cancer and heart problems are leading causes of death for men, and people who binge drink are twice as likely to die of heart complications and stroke [according to the American Heart Association](https://www.alcohol.org/effects/heart-attack/), so we should be doing what we can to curbstomp this.

1482,"I just back from dinner with my parents and it was sobering. For my whole life, my dad was a fit and healthy guy who regularly ran 10ks and excersized daily. That's to say he never had a ""gut"" before. Now he does. It looks like he hasn't excersized in weeks and the end of his belly hangs over his belt slightly now. The whole paternal side of my family struggles with diabetes, but my dad was always on top of it, he went on a severely low carb diet at the age of 25, worked out daily, etc. Now it just seems like he has stopped trying. This is all fine, he can do whatever he wants, he's an adult. He's also turning 70 this year. My grandfather died at the age of 45 from a heart attack, my oldest uncle died at 78 from a heart attack, my second oldest uncle has had 4 heart attacks and is now 76. All with diabetes. I'm increasingly worried that my dad is only a few years away from his first and possibly last heart attack. He was diagnosed 4 years ago with pre-diabetes and likely has it now. 

We were never close when I was a kid, he travelled a lot for work. And now that he is finally not travelling because of covid, I am in school full time and work a 20 hour week on the side. I'm freaking out. I know so little about him and he'll be gone soon. 

I only have a few close friends, but not really anyone I can talk to about this. All of my friends parents are in their early 50s. How do I come to terms with a father that probably wont see me reach my mid 20s?",0
1483,"My father is dying of cancer. I read before about someone recording / taking note of all the questions and answers as a keepsake and figured I'd do the same.

He's not a well man. It's been a slow downhill slope since losing the last of his sight 16 years ago,then diabetes, then heart attack etc. I'm 27m and the eldest of 3. He survived one major operation but it's spread and he's been given 6months-2 years to live - but obviously with Covid going on and him being in crap health in the first place I don't expect him to make it that long. I live abroad (although not very far) and obviously there's a possibility I won't get to see him in person again.

Tbh I'm just rambling here, I don't feel anything yet nor did I when he told me. I just know either way I've got to be strong enough to look after mum. And obviously I don't want to ask him anything too harsh or upsetting to make things harder for him than they already are.


TL;DR:
So anyway my questions so far are:

- what would you have asked your father if you could have before he died?
- would you be willing to walk <my gf> down the aisle?
- is there anything you would have done differently?
- what can I do to best look after mum?
- what do you consider your best qualities?
- what do you consider your worst qualities?
- what would you say to your grandchildren when they're older?
- what could I have done to have been a better son?

Edit - just to say thanks for all of the amazing responses guys. I'm trying to make a mega list and I'm not even halfway through yet :)",0
1484,"My father is 70 next year, always been close. However with is age he's starting to have major health problems, two tumours and most likely pre diabetic (even though he is a nurse, and as most males do he ignores it, and he knows better).

I have asked him is the past what's going on, to just be brushed off with a "" oh it's nothing"" or ""it's under control"" clearly isn't. He does the same when my sister asks him questions. Yet every now and then I get little bits of second hand info. That's how I found out about his tumours. I didn't even know he had a heart attack, till two days later, when his brother called me, it was his second and I never knew about the first one.

Now I realise part of it stems from him beingy father and always seeing me as his little boy, not a grown man. Along with not wanting to worry me, but it honestly makes it worse, and O would love to have a open discussion with him and my sister about it, so we know what's going on.

In two days I'm going with my other friend as class's representatives to his dad's funeral,I'll have a chance to talk to him for a bit,but I'm a little bit scared,I don't want to hurt him more or say anything wrong,so please men,can you help me with this one ?

\[EDIT:So today I found out that politicians in my country (I live in Poland,and tbh. things happening in here are really bad) decided that only five people can be on the funeral,twenty people if family is bigger and probably ten or fifteen people can be in church,this church is pretty small so I'm not really surprised,I'm really thankful to you,who commented this post,I'll save it if someone's going to need help with things like this too (I hope you won't tho).\]",0
1487,"I love my partner very dearly, and this only comes from a place of concern. Physically, he looks great! He’s very muscular, is not obese, and I find him very attractive. However, after a year of living together I am growing concerned about his eating habits. 

He never seems to gain any serious weight from it, but the first five months we lived together I gained 40lbs (which I have lost now) from eating his cooking and along with him when he went out to eat. The only things he’ll eat most days, unless I’m there to cook for him, are soda, chips, and steaks. This man loves his red meat, and it is not uncommon for him to eat it multiple times a day and STILL wake up around 1AM and throw another steak on the grill. I cannot seem to get him to eat any fruits or vegetables, and he claims to get his nutrients from “fruit juice” and vitamin water which I have explained is terrible for him! Even if I can get him to eat vegetables, I have to prepare them or he’ll drown them in butter and oil while sautéing them. 

He’s in his early 20’s, so this hasn’t caused his blood pressure to soar yet but I am concerned about him. He’s been hinting at an engagement soon, and I love him dearly and don’t want my future husband to have a heart attack at 43 years old! I cook for him usually 3-4 times a week, and am unsure how to motivate him to eat more fruits/vegetables/lean meat. 

What do you suggest?",0

1490,"Hi,

I'm 5'4"" and I weigh 128 lbs (58 kg). I'm also a 20 year old girl. My measurements are 38"", 27"", and 39"" (bust, waist, hip).

I never thought I was overweight and at risk of dying until recently. My dad had been shocked when he heard how much I weighed (128 lbs). My brother is around 6 ft and he only weighs 15 lbs more than me. He was joking about how we're like 10 inches apart but I weigh the same as him. My dad joined in and said I need to take care of my health. My ex boyfriend used to also say that girls should be under a 100 lbs. 

All the guys that are really close to me (dad, brother, ex-boyfriend) have been telling me I'm going to die of a heart attack. I don't want to be unhealthy but even my doctor said I was perfectly normal. All my friends at school tell me I have a beautiful body and compliment me constantly but that could be them just being nice. I would believe my dad and brother and take their advice but they sometimes like to get me down and hurt me so I don't trust them wholeheartedly.

Do you guys think I'm at an unhealthy weight and need to get it under control? 

Thanks!",0

1493,"We were having a fight for a few days and i moved a few things over to a friends. Two days later my phone rings from our neighbour asking why there is a fire truck and ambulance at my house. My 5 year old and 13 year old boys were there playing video games while she laid down in bed not feeling well and had a heart attack apparently. Doctors said she went 45 minutes plus without oxygen to her brain. My 13 year old said that the little one came and said that Mum won't wake up. Her parents are acting like i murdered her and swept my children to their house. Her family is huge and I have none. They were my Family. They are telling me that we were separated and it doesn't matter how long. I was a stay at home dad and also worked nights in the family business. I have a Legal Aid lawyer but they have said i need a private bar lawyer to pursue property issues. I have no money for that. They went into my house and took all the legal documents and jewelry. They took her phone and read all of our intimate text messages. I have had a complete mental breakdown and have so far left my children with them as not to upset them any further and have been dealing with this solely by Myself. How can people be like this regardless of their opinion of our life. We were happy and did it on our own. Just trying to type this out and maybe see what anyone else has to say. I am so confused and broken. Why do these people think my children should lose both parents because we were in a deep argument. 16 years, 10 months and 30 days we were together. House paid off. We must have been doing something right but not according to these people. I am no perfect angel but my heart has always been in the right place. They are very wealthy. All of a sudden my Daughter wont take the phone to speak to me which was a complete surprise yesterday. We did family hugs and said i love you daily. I have always been there and been over the top protective. If they had a problem with my parenting why have they never said it before and now tell me they are ""protecting"" them? I was always a good loving Dad. I am so worried about my children these people are not what my kids need. they need to be with me. They have been with me their entire lives and now this? How can they do this? I miss her so much. I want to comfort my children. They told me to get my ""stuff"" together and in the future I can be the Dad again and they will be the Grandparents. Wth? Who made them the powers of the universe. I need help.

I don't know if this is the right sub.

Is there anybody out there? I am reaching out to the internet for this as i am stumped legally and so much more.
I am in Canada if that matters

1496,"Just curious to hear other guys' stories.

I used to be a fitness nut. I competed in powerlifting at a solid 220 lbs and was seriously training for a bodybuilding competition. Lifted 6 days a week, ate painfully clean, the works. Then I had a severe back injury, aggravated an existing herniated disc. I couldn't lift at all, then I still couldn't lift the way I wanted to, and completely lost all motivation to do anything. I gained a lot of weight and developed severe sleep apnea, which made a comeback even less likely. 

I had a wake-up call this year when I tried to donate blood 3 times and I couldn't because my resting heart rate was over 100 each time. I made excuses the first 2 times (stress, too match caffeine) but couldn't deny I had a problem after 3 times. Weighed myself for the first time in over a year and was shocked to find I was 300 lbs. I took a good look in the mirror and was disgusted with what I saw. I took down all my old pictures because I couldn't bear to look at them anymore.

I'm on the comeback train now, got a CPAP machine, eating strict keto, and seeing a personal trainer. I don't feel the need to be that big and strong anymore, but I don't want to have a heart attack at 31. Down 15 pounds already and really trying to make this comeback stick. 

Anyone else go through something similar? How did you deal with it?

Anyway, he was my best friend, and we had plans that we couldn't get through. But since I saw his body in the hospital like 9-10 hours ago I haven't felt too down. Mostly shock. 

At the hospital I was there with his parents and siblings, we just reminisced and told stories and laughed. 

I've barely cried at all, a tiny bit when I first saw him and then again when my aunt, step mom and I went to break the news to my younger brother. I've mostly been in shock but now I've gotten time to really grasp the reality of the situation but I'm still just a bit sad and nothing more.

Idk how common that is, I mean I loved so much and we've always had a great relationship so idk why I'm taking this so well. I know for some people it can take days or even months before they can start to grief but I feel like I should at least feel something.

Furthermore, being alone for an extended period of time ratchets my anxiety up a couple of magnitudes. I rent from my parents, and they've gone 600 miles away for the week. So I'm by myself, which I don't like in the first place. 

The meds and talking about my anxiety seem to help, but what else can I do to help myself. I am seeing a GI doc to try getting my gut under control. But what else can I be doing?

We weren't close, but my mum and my uncle Tony (who is visiting us)  are obviously really upset over the sudden loss of their brother. 

I'm not crying, but I feel like I ought be. Worse though, I don't feel the need to cry. I've always taken maybe a bit too pragmatic view when it comes to death - it's something that happens to everyone and it sucks whether you knew it wasn't coming or whether it's unexpected, like it was with my uncle. Ordinarily, I wear my heart on my sleeve and am generally the most openly emotional member of my family. But I just can't seem to have any kind of reaction to this news and I'm not comfortable with how that makes me feel. Am I just a fundamentally bad person to be so accepting of it?

Some commented saying that their man should be fit and being chubby he'll probably have a heart attack.I'm a girl and I've always found this ""bones are for dogs"" movement to be a little out of hand and often a cover for being unhealthy(in my social group).

1508,"I had a work ""friend"" who was funny/also weird and didn't have a lot of friends but I used to hang out with him on occasion.  I eventually became his boss so I stopped hanging out with him completely, and when I transferred to another location I didn't see him again until his going away party.  He moved to the other side of the U.S.

Fast forward a few years later (still haven't seen him, occasional FB comments here and there, not even a text message) and he sends me a FB message asking me to fly out to his wedding next year and be his best man.

Concerns:

- I am getting married myself next year, money will be tight at that point
- I am not close to him anymore, don't even know his intended spouse
- I won't be anywhere near him to help fulfill some of the typical Best Man duties such as throwing a bachelor party

I am typically a tell-it-like-it-is asshole, but this guy has always seemed a little sensitive/desperate for friends, he had a rough year when his mom unexpectedly passed, his intended spouse recently had a heart attack, and I feel like this request is indicative of him not forming very many friends in his new state, so I want to be politely flattered but decline.

1509,"For the longest time, I've hated my dad. Ever since I was a little kid, all he did was let my family suffer. He'd always pick on my mom for being stupid of things and ""useless"" while she worked day and night just to give me and my sisters a happy life. I could tell that she cried in secret daily because she always had a hard time with dad but never admitted it. She would always arrive at 10pm because of the hectic commute only to be greeted by slaps and kicks from my dad because she wasn't able to go home early so she could cook dinner for us. I hated him then and I still hate him now. Growing up seeing my buddies have amazing dads didn't really help me. While their fathers took them camping, hiking or playing sports, I'm busy hiding and crying in my room because my drunk old man would throw vases and plates on the walls. I fought him once and cursed me that no matter what happens I'll end up like him. 

I'm 27 now and currently working with stable income. My father mellowed down because he had 2 heart attacks in a row but he's still an asshole. Even death doesn't want him. We keep it civil now because I don't want to cause my mom a headache.

I'm deciding to marry soon and become a father in a few years. I don't know jack if I became a great man because I never knew what that felt or what a ""man"" should really be. My sob story is over.

1510,"Soo well start off with some back story just so you can get a feel for the situation...

I am 23, never had any serious relationships or any for that matter. I've always been that type of person that laughs makes other people laugh. Always smiling and lightning up the mood, a real comedian you would say.  But for some reason that has only been an outter shell, a coping mechanism. I think I use jokes and laughter and smiles to cover up the loneliness deep down.

I feel very isolated and can't really share my feelings with people. I just feel very vulnerable to the fact that it'll leave me with hurt and emotional I don't need. The only times I ever cry are when someone that I know dies or something severe happens to trigger these emotions. Even though I'm friends with a lot of people, I am also not friends with anyone.

It's like that very popular guy everyone looks up to. I talk and associate with everyone and therfore everyone knows me to be popular. The thing is, I don't have a circle of close friends. I just have a lot of acquaintances you could say. But any time I would go out, I could pick up chick's and get their numbers very easily. I'm a decent looking guy, but I think I have the comedy going for me. All of these girls never led to more than anything but a date.

I never followed through with education after high school and been working ever since. I've worked many different jobs in many different fields, but mostly all Labour and customer service. Finally landed an office job.  Pays really good, but I feel trapped here. It's not what I wanted to do in life.

Anyway, I've never been able to get into any relationships because of these reasons. There are no young girls my age working in factories or that many in full time customer service jobs. Also I don't really go out much because I'm not invited to hang out by anyone. So here it comes full circle, this is where life kicks you in the balls. I met this amazing chick at the office job. Mind you, their cubicles but regardless, for me, it's an office compared to the places I've worked. Anyway long story short, I fell for her.

I fell for her pretty hard. Ever since the first day I started, 3months ago, we just clicked and bonded. We hit it off and flirted all the time. I even lost a bet on purpose to her just so I would have a chance to get her something. I work afternoons and she works nights. So our shifts only overlap for an hour,  mind you that's more than enough for me to get girly butterflies. I literally count down the minutes till she gets there. When she starts work, I start my break at the lunch room and she even comes for my whole break and we just talk and joke. 

So Friday I decided to ask her out. Like this is very first girl, I've emotionally let in and been vulnerable to. I let my guard down and the whole week building up to it, I couldn't eat and had shortness of breath. The whole 9 yards when it comes to having a crush on someone. Come Friday I get her alone during my lunch break but I don't have the courage to ask her. I keep asking what she's doing on Saturday after she's told me she's hanging out with her family. Sunday is the other day she's off but my mind isn't thinking because my heart is using of the blood from keeping me from having a heart attack. She kept looking at me like she knew or anticipated me asking her out. 

So as my break finishes we go back to our desks. Fast forward to the end of my shift, I go to the lunch room and grab my bag and on the way back I make it official to ask her. Nervously I go up to her desk and blurt everything out at the same time. I just came out as ...Sunday...do you wanna get something...eat?

BAM. Waited lifted off my shoulders and for sure all the signs point to her saying yes. No, that's not the case. She looks at my all funny and says maybe she'll see if she's not busy, but gives me her number. Shit, at this point I'm kind of excited and nervous and sad that she didn't say yes but at least gave me her number. 

But when I texted her today, I said ""Hey, Boston pizza today at 12pm"". Now my heart is POUNDING and just waiting for a response. My chest is hurting from my heart beat and I'm getting cold sweats from thinking about our date. But to my surprise she says and I quote...

""I won't be able to make it tomorrow.  I know you have nothing better to do with your life but I'm busy"".

And that's all she wrote. Tore me up with 2 lines. To think, she led me on this whole time and I knew for a fact she used to initiate the flirting. I feel like a complete bag of shit. I even went against my better judgment and let her in which makes this worse.

So guys, how do I handle the situation from here? What do I say to her at work? How do I approach her or do I approach her at all? I'm afraid she might tell people at work as well and make it awkward for me. I'm so confused and hurt and shattered. I've never let this happen before and I think I'm only going to withdraw to myself a bit more. Such is life. Thanks for listening, it feels better just getting it out. And I thought she was into me.

1511,"I grew up with a high functioning closet alcoholic father. He worked hard during the day and drank himself to sleep every night. He wasn't a raging alcoholic, but his alcoholism definitely affected the way I grew up and has a huge impact on my life. He passed away at the age of 52 from a heart attack (which I strongly believe was brought on by his drinking)

I (30/f) am dating a guy (34/m) who really enjoys drinking. On a weekend night he easily has 2 drinks before we go out, 2 drinks when we're at dinner, and another 2-3 drinks when we go listen to music. Or he'll drink 4 drinks (2 liquor and 2 beers) on a random weekday night when we meet up for drinks and appetizers after work. If we're having a night in, he'll pour himself 2 whiskey and water drinks. We rarely every hang out where he doesn't consume an alcoholic drink. Does this seem concerning?

1512,"I'm asking AskMen because this extends beyond girls and dating - it's a lifestyle choice.

I've been putting immense pressure on myself to be more masculine since 2015 started. I've been an introverted bookworm/nerd my entire life, and only during the last few months have I realized the incorrectness of such a lifestyle and started questioning and rejecting every way I've done things - how I walk, how I talk, how I project myself, how I THINK, etc. I haven't been happy at all since this realization because I can't stop worrying and overcompensating - but hey, no pain no gain right? These are my most pressing problems:

- only 5'8""

- voice isn't deep enough

- baby face, lacking in facial hair (maybe it has to do with being Asian)

- socially awkward, afraid of interaction

- hobbies are nerdy 

- lacking confidence


If you think about it, how many men these days are alpha, ambitious, unemotional, physically fit, in control of their life circumstances and doing what they want instead of being emotional airbags that sit home and watch TV? I want to put myself on the path to becoming the former. Is that even possible? Are our wills free enough such that we can decide what image we want to project to the world, and ultimately, who we want ourselves to be? Am I not being alpha or masculine just by the fact that I'm analyzing life way too much and being too emotional/philosophical? 

I will do EVERY SINGLE FUCKING THING I can do about my physical appearance. I will lift. I will try to do vocal exercises to make my voice deeper. I will inject testosterone to grow some fucking facial hair so I can be a real man for once, if I have to. 

As for the mental part, I will put myself out there, even if I get near heart attacks from the extent to which I push myself to do things I don't want to do. I will try to distance myself from my emotions and focus on things REAL men focus on, like ambition and control of my circumstances. I have taken measures to make myself appear more assertive, by saying no a lot more often than I used to, and overall just not taking shit from other people.

As for confidence, I will fake it until I make it. I will act unnatural and do uneasy things even if it makes me uncomfortable or unhappy. In theory, at some time in the future I will internalize confidence. 

Anything I'm missing? Masculine men of AskMen, what are your suggestions? This is a very open-ended post, but I really believe I need to put myself on the right path so I end up as one of the alpha men in the world according to the archetype I described above, and not some hopeless beta chump. Unfortunately, the gene pool has decided to make this very hard for me and I'm not sure if it's even possible to measure up (figuratively and literally) in the long run.

1513,"I'm going to start from the very beginning, so this might get long.

So, this started a couple of years ago. I was 30, had a nice job that occupied most of my time and mind. I wasn't really interested in having a relationship or even to look out for a woman, I just had a one night stand when I felt the need to. I had just one real relationship, while in University, it lasted barely a year and even if I loved the girl, it made me fell trapped and unhappy, it wasn't something I was willing to experience again in the near future. 

At the time I had no idea how miserable and empty my life was. I thought I had everything I wanted. 
The cherry on top was the promotion I had been working for years, it meant more rewarding work and independence in my daily work life. But the promotion meant way more work too, so my superior thought it would be a good idea to get someone to do basic stuff that would just waste my time. And that was a really good idea, after a while I was feeling overwhelmed, and I couldn't wait for *help* to come. I was expecting a young, male, freshly minted engineer from the local University. Instead I got a 21 yrs old female tech, with little to no experience in the field, that barely spoke our language (but had a perfect english and knew a couple of other languages too). The first time I saw her, I couldn't help but think she must have sucked some very important dicks to get the job. She wasn't Victoria's Secret hot, but was really really pretty, and never passed unnoticed. After expressing my doubts about her to my superior I was told to suck it up and give it a try because she seemed to know her shit pretty well. 

And fuck, he was right. Even just after a couple of weeks I couldn't see myself working without her, I never had to explain things twice, and most of the time she would figure stuff out on her own. She was very professional, never used her big, beautiful dark eyes to get out of trouble (and fuck, I would kill someone if she asked for it with her puppy eyes) or flirted with me to get something. She was also very fun and it was just nice to have her around, she knew so much stuff, always had a good book or movie to recommend. One could feel her passion for everything she liked and did. After a couple of months we were already having coffee in the morning and lunch together. We pretty much passed 10 to 12 hours and 5 days a week together. Day after day I just liked her more. We didn't talk about personal stuff very often, but I knew she was single and was having trouble socializing outside of work. Being practically a socially awkward penguin, I couldn't help her. She knew I was single too, and even made some comments about how it's weird, because I'm handsome and a great guy, I just told her it was a choice.

Then we started travelling for work together, at least a couple of times a month. That's when trouble started. We would be together all day long for three to five days, and I couldn't notice how awesome she was. At the beginning I thought it was just an infatuation. A crush. I would lie to myself, saying it was normal when you pass all this time together, that there were tons of girls like her, I just needed sex. Lies, a bunch of lies.
She was amazing, so smart and funny. Serious when she had too, but never too much. We could talk non stop for a whole 12-hour flight. I never got tired of her, I just wanted more, time with her was never enough. When I was nervous or worried about something she could calm me down and make me think instead of freaking out. 
We ended up sharing an office, so she wouldn't have to run up and down the stair from the cubicles floor to my office. I had her in front of me all day long, and it was the most beautiful thing ever, I loved every single minute of my day with her. When she wasn't there, I could still feel the scent of her perfume and that made me so fucking happy.
I knew that at least 5 or 6 of my colleagues had major crushes on her, but she never agreed to a date with one of them. I never had the heart to ask her if it was because she didn't like them or because she wouldn't date a coworker.

At one point I stopped lying to myself, and just acknowledged that I loved her with all my heart. But having the balls to tell her was a whole lot more than that. 
I was scared that she wasn't this amazing woman, that maybe I was just lonely and ended up idolizing her, and made her look perfect in my head. So I just kept on going with my life, and didn't tell her a thing. Somedays I would feel like shit, because I couldn't stand not having her. Everytime she touched me was both amazing and painful. Somedays I would just hate her, how could she be so oblivious? How could she not notice how much I'm suffering? Why she is so nice to me but never go the extra step?
I didn't say nothing for almost another year. And the only thing that changed is that I loved her even more. Until our last business trip, some weeks ago. 

I just couldn't live like this anymore, so I decided I was going to tell her. I thought about the consequences, if she rejected me, working with her would be a nightmare, but if she had feelings for me I would be the happiest man alive and my life would not be miserable anymore.
So we left for a week long trip overseas, I was more than nervous. She could feel there was something odd, and asked a couple of times if I was feeling ok. I said I was fine, it's just my fear of flying. Yes, I hate flying, I can't feel safe on a metal tube flying thousands of meter up in the air, I just can't. She always holds my hand during take off and landing, and it makes me feel so much better. The week goes on as usual, besides the fact that I'm always thinking about when and how I'll tell her. On the last day the worst fucking idea comes to my mind: I'll write a fucking letter, then give it to her, so I won't have a heart attack while talking to her. 
After we are done with work in the morning, we went to lunch together and I didn't even eat because of how nervous I was. When I got back to my hotel room I wrote the letter, I actually wrote something like 6 or 7 letters before getting it right. The thing is long, to full pages, and my handwriting is small. And I don't know why, but I thought it was a good idea to give her the letter some hours before getting our flight home. I know, I'm an idiot.
So I call her, and ask her if she can come over to pick up something. She comes over, I open the door and the door and give her the letter. She asks what's it. I tell her it's personal, and she fucking opens it right there in front of me. I ask her to please, to go read it in her room. But she doesn't, she gets into my room and starts reading it in front of me. I'm there, sitting in my bed while the love of my live stands in front of me reading everything I had to tell her. She reads the whole thing without saying a word. Nothing. It felt like it took hours for her to read it.

You know how it happens in movies, when the guys tells the girl he loves her, and they kiss and have awesome sex? Yeah, that didn't happen. 
Seeing her smile while reading the letter, made me think that was going to happen, but it didn't. When she finished I got up and she hugged me, gave me a kiss on my chest and went silent. After what felt like eternity, she told me her feelings for me as not nearly as profound as mine for her, told I was a good friend, that she liked me a lot and had to think about this. I was going to cry, I felt the desperate need to cry, and after she left I did, I cried like a fucking child. That was the most physical contact I ever got with her, for a moment it felt like a sneak peak of what I could have with her, but after what she told me it felt like getting stabbed a thousand times.

We took our flight home, it was a night flight. She usually sleeps for the whole flight when we fly at night, but this time she was awake for the whole time. And we exchanged something like 5 work in 10 fucking hours, and it was about the shitty food. 
After that she left for her 2 weeks vacation, she'll be back on monday. I haven't heard from her since that night. I feel like leaving my job and moving to another continent for the shame. I hate myself for putting me, and specially her, in this situation. 


I'm writing this here because my closest male friends are work colleagues, and I don't feel like sharing this with them. But I had to share/talk with other men. I can't be the only stupid fucker that pulled shit like this.

tl;dr: I'm a stupid fucker.",0
1514,"Long story short, my father died of a heart attack 20 years ago when he was only 38.  Since then, my family has told me that he had the heart attack because he was obese, and I was just a kid when it happened, so I didn't question it.  A few weeks back, my mom let it slip that he had an undiagnosed genetic heart defect that massively increases the chance for sudden cardiac arrest.  I did some research and found that I have a high chance of inheriting the condition from him and have already scheduled a doctors appointment to run some tests.  When I asked my mom why she kept information this important from me for pretty much my whole life, she said that she ""didn't want me to worry about it"".  This isn't the first time my family has kept me in the dark about serious medical issues in my family.  Within the past 2 years, my grandfather, uncle, and brother have all been in the hospital for serious medical issues, and nobody called me to let me know what was going on.  I'll only find out at family gatherings when someone lets it slip, and starts a huge argument because I just found out about it.  It's not because I don't talk to my family regularly.  I talk to my mother weekly, and my grandmother monthly and they purposefully keep these things from me because they ""don't want me to worry"".

1515,"24 never had a girlfriend before (put a fucking bullet in my head)

I'm scared, because I know that when i finally get a girlfreind if she will stay with me for long enough I'm going to buy her a ring, I know me and as much as I dont want to be one of those guys that settles for the first girl to come along I know I will.

The problem is that any girl I meet is going to have WAY more sexual experiance then me and that is going to make me bitter and unable to handle it

(unless I meet another virgin, but that is 99.99% not going to happen)

Of course I know my first relationship will probably fail, but its going to hurt so much, and feel like a waste of time (i know that the whole time thing is usually more of a factor for women then men, but still, i could die of a heart attack at 45 who knows?)

I want as much time with the woman I'm going to be with as I can possibly have.

have any of you had this mindset? did it change once you figured out how to start dating?

1516,"Hey /r/askmen,

I have a good friend who is in his late 40s. Over the last year he's been in full-on midlife crisis mode. He had an emotional affair with a younger woman (wife found out, didn't leave him). He started smoking again. He started drinking voluminously. He has put on abdominal fat. He used to walk every day now he does nothing. He's being treated for depression.

All he wants to do is play music (great!) or sit around smoking / drinking while talking about the younger girl (less great). I'm worried about him, especially with the recent death of James Gandolfinni, who is only a little bit older. My buddy's dad died of a heart attack.

I've asked him to go for runs with me, but I think maybe that's too much for him and his pride is preventing him from trying. He's in a bad way, financially, right now, so going to the gym isn't an option. I thought maybe of asking him to go for walks, but honestly I don't know how to do that without it seeming super awkward.

Maybe I just level with him? I'm in my early 30s and all my friends are pretty fit, so I've never had to do this before. Any advice from others who have been in this situation on either side?

Any advice is appreciated. I worry about the guy.

Now, he has been experiencing heart problems and is going to try to quit drinking on his own. He has always flat out refused to see any doctor, and I'm not sure if he has insurance, but he has a good job.

1519,"[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xx2fh/my_boyfriend_and_i_have_been_dating_for_a_little/). 

So, way to give me a heart attack guys. I talked to him about the whole thing and he said he'd wait. I didn't beg him. I didn't guilt him into it. I said, ""boyfriend, what exactly happens to us when you go off to university?"" and he said, ""well, eatmanydicksfeelings, I don't know. What do you want to happen?"" and I said, ""I want to be in a relationship with you, but I understand you don't want something long distance."" and he said, ""I want a relationship with you too, so if this is something you want, then I will talk to you the majority of every week, and we can continue to be friends blah blah blah and if you are comfortable with not actively searching for other guys to fuck and date while I'm away, then I will do the same and we can see what happens with us when winter break comes around"". 

Or something like that. 

After he said that, I told him I was worried that maybe he just didn't want a long distance relationship because he wanted to chase after college girls and he laughed and said, ""you've been looking on the Internet, haven't you?""

1520,"I matched with girl on tinder who is quite average looking but has some nice big funbags. I managed to charm her enough to text me the same night. The conversation went from match to talking over text 20 minutes later to explicit texts describing what we would do to one another sexually.
The same happened last night and tonight we are meeting when I get out of work. Im afraid that I will either blow it, or that shes super ugly or smells or something. We are planning on fucking and I feel like I am in a situation where I cannot pass on sex.
Id consider myself an attractive guy so Im not worried that she wont like me (but who knows maybe she wont) im more worried that I will be repulsed by sex with her and be trapped. What are some ways to bail last minute without crushing her?

To be clear, as of right now, I have every intention of bending her over her bed (where I am meeting her) She seems great and we have a lot in common. Im just kind of iffie on her appearance bc she doesnt have pictures that really give any inshight into her body

Update: landed the pussy- holy shit

So we went out for a quick dinner and went to her place and immediately got into. She smelled great, had a decent body, amazing pierced huge tits. Dinner was good.- little awkward at first but I made it not so. After we left she invited me into her CLEAN apartment. She started showing me around and my heart was beating so hard that I couldn't even hear what she was saying so I just picked her up and threw her on her bed. I could tell that she wasn't very experienced. Don't have her last name but she claims she was 21. I took her shirt off and out popped a couple of perfect plump tits busting out of her brah. I jumped up, shut the light off took off my shirt and kissed her neck. She was super sensitive to my touch and lips and squirmed at every move I made. I unzipped her pants, threw her legs behind her back kissed her thighs to make sure I wasn't going into a sewer, once nostrils gave me the all clear, I decided to get a little closer but went back up slowly to her pierced nipples and removed her brah. I played with them for like 5 minutes and made my way back down south. I shoved her red panties to the side and went in for the kill. I attacked her viciously with my mouth and had her legs wrapped around the back of my neck while I penetrated her with my tongue. I played with her tits a little more and took my pants off. I kind of had to lead her along and told her forcefully to get down there and suck my dick. she told me she had never done it before and I said ya whatever that's fine. Well her teeth got in the way but I sat up with my legs straight up while she looked up at my (she kept her glasses on btw) and stuffed her mouth with my man meat laying on her stomach like a school girl studying in her bed. 

I was smart enough to throw on a rubber and threw her on her back again and pounded her out for about an hour and went through a few condoms so she could suck me off in between. Finally after building a good sweat up, I busted a big load into her (with a condom on) and called it a night. We fooled around for a few
Minutes and I was on my way. Here I am on my way home. Fully satisfied

1521,"Sorry if this waffles or isn't well structured, I'll try to tidy at a later date. 

Not sure what to say. 21M AFC with SOCIAL ANXIETY, problems just talking to girls my age. Generally don't trust them. Convinced that they find me a pathetic loser frankly, especially the typical 'alpha female'. Only girl I've felt a truly contradictory experience to this assumption with was my ex, who once claimed to love me but MAY have fell for another guy, someone more 'alpha' by my book. I don't know. 

The reasons I think women think I'm this pathetic loser (how do you bold btw?)

1) I have an ANXIETY DISORDER and DEPRESSIVE TENDENCIES; the diagnosis was a blow to my manhood to be honest. The whole 'BIG BOYS DON'T CRY' thing that one circle of friends subscribes to. Being into fitness and self-improvement, big fucking impassable mental barriers in the way of being successful were destroying me.

2) This makes me a bit of a NERVOUS WRECK at times and SUSPICIOUS/PARANOID of people in general 

3) Well ok, I've been like that for years because I got BULLIED throughout school for being 'different'. I've got a LEARNING DISABILITY (Dyspraxia), in school I should have technically been in the year below me in terms of physical and emotional maturity but I busted my ass off to be an equal and actually I was apparently a real Alpha for a 15 yo, lol. Alpha in the good way-fit, intelligent, ambitious, successful, interesting, talented, seeking to better the world and serve others

4) Oh and they also bullied me because I was a FORMER FAT KID (but I lost the weight in Year 8, albeit had body image insecurities and obsessions with appearance every since)

5) It means I DON'T DO DEM MANLY THINGS LIKE DRINKING because it spikes paranoia of the ""stop bitching about me!"" ""no-one said anything...""'variety. I got a lot of stick with my guy friends for what should have even a very simple lifestyle change, until I got out of high school sobriety made me some social pariah.

6) Actually to  be honest I need an early night to think straight and not be a nervous wreck/BROODY BUGGER I THINK/RUMINATE A LOT 

7) ...coffee gives me the JITTERS so I drink green tea. REAL PARTY ANIMAL here!

8) I've had INSOMNIA for years, it's really effing annoying. It has got better in the last year, especially since I restarted exercise and cut down on caffeine, but then I've been giving much less of a fuck for the last year about the stuff that matters and too much about what doesn't. 

9) Despite being sleep deprived, I feel like I should 'MAN UP' and soldier on through the tiredness/be outgoing and stay out late when I don't always have the energy, rather than get early nights. There is no such thing as a tired young man, don't be lazy, sleep is for the weak, etc. This leads to situations where I deliberately stay up late to make myself sleep deprived, triggering my health anxiety while also worsening my mental state in the name of 'manning up'. I basically did a degree sleep deprived

10) Nor did I lift; a psychosomatic FEAR OF HAVING A HEART CONDITION kept me out of the gym for 2 years, losing my decent physique in the process to be replaced with 'skinny-fat' (because I kept up  basic cardio like walking at least). Technically I have a benign heart condition actually

11) So I'm kinda SKINNY at present which makes me internally bitch about all the hot alphas having all the luck. I'm hitting the gym, the barrier is the thoughts of ""Omg I'm under the bench press I can hear my heart pumping I'M DYING HELLLLLLP"" that run through my head when I go. However I seem to be moving more to slim/lean which is good.

12) Because of the psychosomatic heart condition phobia I became quite a HEALTH NUT, it was akin to an EATING DISORDER (?) in the way it negatively affected my life. It WORRIED MY FAMILY a lot, and upset my mum whenever I wouldn't eat dessert or mentioned going to the gym. She wound up on antidepressants (but it turned out that was because she hated her job and I seemed very stressed and unhappy, NOT because I wasnt eating much cake lol) 
It has took a long time, 4 years to be precise, to not feel that I obsessively have to have them watch me eat chocolate every day or get permission to go the gym every damn time. I only realised I'd lost touch with reality when one day I asked my mum 'permission' to masturbate. I'm still working on it. THINK I HAVE TO BE FATTER AGAIN (PUT ON WEIGHT, EAT MORE CAKE, RAISE BODY FAT%) TO MAKE MUM HAPPY
So I am a bit 'scared' of my parents/extended family in that regard, I want to please them but to do so would be to forfeit my own goals. Sometimes, these goals are really basic: for example I have to 'please' Dad by having a lot of cake right before bed even though that historically triggers sleep difficulties, or by eating granola for him when it lowers my testosterone levels, etc.

13) Came back from GP with normal yet low-ish testosterone prior to restarting lifting. No hot early twenties femme wants a guy with LOW T for Christ's sake

13) Sometimes I feel like I'm LETTING MY DAD DOWN BY NOT HAVING LOWER TESTOSTERONE (?) levels and actively try to lower them by binge eating…apparently this is quite an unusual thought process? I think he would prefer me to be a bit chubbier, and have a higher-pitched voice, and perhaps have weaker erections, but I'd rather he's not thinking about that. This is especially true since his SO is, er…a bit on the heavy side.  lovely woman, step mum soon enough I'm sure, and vegetarian, but not my physical type. And no I am NOT a troll, I am a little crazy

14) Well I've been SCARED OF MY MUM AND SISTER for years, they're both controlling and my sister is very dominant. MUM MAY HAVE CHEATED ON DAD, to this day I do not know nor am I sure I want to. Basically I lived at home with anxiety getting WHIPPED by an overprotective mother with passive aggressive tendencies and a dominating sister, having lost my father figure who was kicked out of the house and forced to go into 2 jobs to pay off the equity split Mum received for 'the kids' (this is money I never saw btw). Despite everything I don't hate my mother, who has anxiety and panic attacks too, I just can't always fully trust her. 

15) BUT THE DIVORCE WAS 5 YEARS AGO, my mum's been remarried 2 years and my dad seeing someone for 3. So I'm not sure whether it's just becoming a SCAPEGOAT (?) to blame for my problems instead of facing situations I often created myself through maladaptive coping strategies for anxiety (such as, perhaps, long questions to Internet forums in the dead of night? Hmm) 
Despite this I can't deny DIVORCE HAS JADED MY VIEW on love and companionship with the opposite sex.

16) I'm a VIRGIN. This is a no-brainer for why it makes me insecure. I take the attitude that most college girls have already been in a few relationships, had their heart broken and broke someone's heart. They've been around the block, and they see me as this sweet innocent thing. A bit like I am the virgin to deflower, except they won't (because they think I'm a loser) so instead they patronise me

 17) By now you should have noticed I'm currently HOPELESSLY NEUROTIC? I don't have much to talk about; this never used to be a problem though, and I'm good at bullshitting my way through conversations with people despite it

18) I CAN'T DRIVE

19) I CAN'T COOK MUCH (yet…I can make a decent chilli con carne and omelette I guess?) 

20) Since I've only just graduated, I have NO FULL TIME JOB NOR CERTAIN CAREER PATH

21) I feel I'm TOO SENSITIVE/EMOTIONAL (?). 'Big boys don't cry', 'don't be needy' etc.

22) Finally, a SELF-FULFILLING PROOPHECY: I'm afraid of women so I think women are laughing at me, so I'm scared to talk to them…so they think I'm pathetic and laugh…over and over...


I find a lot of my guy friends in the 'big boys don't cry' circle  talk quite disparagingly of women at the pub, trying to one-up each other with how many they've pegged. One of these friends-let's call him Bill-is ALWAYS sneaking in a story about this girl who liked him but he found annoying because she wouldn't leave him all night, or these girl who he just casually ended up having threesomes with, or his crazy ex girlfriends etc. Sometimes I think Bill's making it up or exaggerating to cover up some insecurities. He's not the stereotypical alpha male, he's pretty skinny. What Bill is, however, is intelligent, well versed in pop-culture, can play the guitar (or did a few years ago anyway) and charismatic-boy can he talk. 

Despite Bill's low opinion on females, he recently had 120 Likes for his Just Graduated Facebook status of which about 80 were from -of which at least half were very attractive to me. I did the same thing and I got about 20, most of which were close friends and family, some I'm convinced were pity likes. Essentially I threw away a lot of my social life for uni due to my problems, spoke to only a handful of girls, and the only one I made a lasting friendship with became my SO became my ""let's be friends"" ex became not in my life. Or in other words: I now have no female friends because I'm scared of women and have some rather fucked up views on relationships. I'm embarrassed of the lack of female friends, and concerned by the latter reasons for this.

This begs the question: SHOULD I BE MORE LIKE BILL TO GET SUCCESS? I don't even mean get laid, I mean not bore a girl away. Thing is our moral/philsophical compasses are polar opposites

-he's atheist and mocks religion, I'm a former Christian current agnostic
-he's liberal, I'm conservative
- he's done loads of drugs at uni, smoked and binge drinks, that's all a bad idea for me with my mental health and hypochondria
-he does his best to be a macho man and one of the guys, I'm the more sensitive and introspective type (or 'introverted beta' if you really have to categorise me) 

He's talking about having pulled +50 throughout university, yet I just can't get my head around the idea of a one night stand and only had one (albeit serious) relationship. How you can convince someone to be comfortable enough to let you stick your dick in their vagina and NOT develop some sort of emotional connection is beyond me. Personally I don't trust myself with my dick a lot of the time, let alone anyone else. It's one of the main reasons I'm a virgin and deliberately avoided my issues around women for a long time-but I'm 21 now, my track record for uni is DIRE (I've been depressed by my anxiety issues and lived at home,) 


Now a lot of this could be pure PARANOIA, as I get the SAME FEELINGS WITH LADS talking about me when I leave, laughing. Most of the reasons I think people would laugh seem to be with me NOT BEING 'ONE OF THE GUYS', the reasons listed above. 


Apologies for the length of that. That was a hell of a lot. 


Tl; dr I think girls  are laughing at me or regard me as a child because I have a mental illness and learning disability, both of which make me 

a) more socially awkward than the average guy in university (but yeah college for all you folks in America)

b) prone to hypersensitivity and extreme emotional reactions which mean that I have to live a somewhat more mature, laid back and 'responsible' (boring?) lifestyle. I'm at the age the girls want to party hard and get laid with every hot guy under the sun and I just want to go to the movies or a gig or something and save my affections for that someone special. I'm loathe to say 'The One' as my ex was in hindsight a case of Oneitis 

c) no manly man, I'm a geeky virgin New Age Sensitive Guy who likes the Disney Renaissance, intellectual debate and musicals among other things, but happens to like to lift 

There should be no reason to feel so insecure and self-deprecating: I'm a reasonably fit, intelligent and hard-working guy with a degree under my belt, a part-time job, musically talented, and I have some experience with acting/musical theatre. I've also been told I have 'a way with words' when I want to, narrating a novel at public recitals, creative writing/poetry/song-writing and so on. That probably didn't come out in this, this is way wayyy too long, but my anxiety has made me more desperate.

So my questions are: 

1) How do I convince myself women are NOT laughing at me or inclined to condescend me? 

2) Failing that, how do I just not care what they think? 

3) Is there a way I can change and be more like Bill to get success, without compromising on my moral code? (That is, I would hate to be 'pumped and dumped' so I refuse to do the same to a woman)

4) Is there something very wrong with me, or have I just skipped the commitment-phobic bachelor phase? ",0

1523,"30/M here. My Dad (58/M) died earlier this month due to COVID. It's come as a shock to us all as he had no underlying health conditions and we fully expected him to make a full recovery when he first contracted the virus. Unfortunately the virus did a number on him and the damage to his lungs was extensive and irreparable. Towards the end, he was in intensive care and on a ventilator. It got to the point where the ventilator was artificially prolonging his life and the risk of cardiac arrest was growing each day. My family and I made the difficult decision to withdraw life support and let him pass peacefully without any suffering.

I am struggling to comprehend his passing if I can be honest. His decline was rapid and my memories of him prior to testing positive are very fresh in my mind. It almost feels like this is all a dream and at any moment I'm going wake up to the real world where my Dad is still alive.

I'm struggling to adapt to this new chapter in my life. I know it's only been 10 or so days since he passed, but I just don't see how I'll get over this.

Youngest of four. 25 y.o. Live at home because my parents are semi-OK with it, and I have career goals. Family communication structure is passive-aggressive/dismissive. Currently have an alcoholic father who is in his 60's, with several cardiac risk factors.


I suspect my father is suffering from  disease, with rivalling apathy. I will be gone and very busy in one year (medschool application process going well). I have encouraged AA, accompanied him to meetings, had encouraging discussion, and toted reform of diet, etc. to no avail. My mother has harped this sentiment of change for years, and at this point accepts ""the incorrigible behaviors of a suicidal man."" 


Passive/dismissive/egocentric behaviors from siblings... He has moments of clarity, like others suffering from alcoholism, with the quick relapses. What to do? Time to move on? How do I establish influence with him, and the others, to promote good communication toward wellness, and a healthier family infrastructure, given my position as the youngest son?


Thanks in advance for your serious advice.",0
1528,"So, I am approaching 30 and am on an SSRI medication for anxiety. I do intense weight training 2-3x/week, and I eat a really healthy diet full of good fats and enough cholesterol. I take Vitamin D everyday, have moderate-low stress, and sleep well for the most part. 

But I notice I am just not experiencing as much...vigor as I used to, and I could really use a kick.

I especially notice this with my sensitivity. What specifically for sensitivity and increased enjoyment have you done?

Otherwise, what other 'hacks' do you know to really get that testosterone to its max and enjoy sex to the fullest?

1529,"Serious question, and situation. I'm 42, and I'm tired. Almost all the time. I'll summarize what could be contributing, and what I've tried to boost my energy level.

Contributing factors: 2 young children, desk job (a job I love, interesting and generally low stress with regular hours), over weight (but lost 15lbs this year), sleep apnea, limit exercise.

Stuff I've done: Getting 7-8 hours of sleep, occasionally interrupted by kids, eating healthier (lots of protein and fruit, some vegis), CPAP for sleep apnea, losing weight (15 lost, 45 to go), getting some exercise (walking, some biking and swimming, 20-40 pushups most days), cutting back on sugar and junk food. Thyroid tested, ok. Blood tested, ok except good cholesterol is a little low and bad variety is a little high. Generally healthy in terms of colds and stuff. I'm still freakin' tired.

Other stuff: I don't do caffeine, other than what's in the occasional chocolate. 1 or 2 drinks a month. No smoking or recreational drugs.

I've heard that men often get tired in their 40s, and hoping some of your fine gentlemen will have suggestions on how I can boost my energy.

1530,"I just thought about this while eating a prime rib sandwich 1) by myself 2) at a bar. I used to wait tables, and it was pretty much a guarantee that the guy would get the burger (or its equivalent), and the gal would get some form of vegetable. 

Now, I *totally* order salads all the time, not because I give a shit (I'm a woman, I'm married, have stretch marks, etc, etc), but because I just don't feel inclined to eat all those lipids. However, when I'm with a group, and I do order heftier fare, the guys are always like, ""Duuuude, nice, way to go!"" 

But thinking back on all those orders I've taken, I just wonder if those women were fucking hungry but too wuss to eat any damn meat in front of a man. 

Does it matter?

1531,"Sorry if this is a subject that's been touched on before.

This is coming from the back of a 2 year long experience of exploring sex with a S.O. - for a bit of context, I'm 28m and it might help to talk about my own experience, but I'll try to keep it brief.

I discovered porn and masturbation around 14, I went to an all boys school so it wasn't a topic that came up often. I have only really recently realised how much porn has warped my view of sex. 

There's been a whole thing, seemingly recently, about sex education not exploring women's sexuality, which I agree with and is an entirely different thing, but I don't think it covers men's at all either. At least for myself, porn was my educator - thinking about porn generally, it is very focused on getting men hooked through different ways and methods, and is generally done from a male point of view - how many videos carry on after a guy finishes? 

My view on sex until very recently was that it was a performance or a conquest, something to go back and tell the lads about - 'I destroyed her' 'I had her screaming' 'yo we went 3 times last night' - and I'm curious if this is because of a wider brainwashing of porn. I used to think I was a god just cause I put a girls legs behind their heads and went as rough as possible, cause you know, girls have screaming orgasms when you do that. 

Obviously my learning curve with my most recent experience has taught me more to tune into every individual different, listen to what they like and don't like and I'm all game for that (completely irrelevant but damn I love going down on a girl). 

That being said, I only recently realised that I'm still in that 'I did this - this was my accomplishment' frame of mind. It''s been somewhat liberating to let girls have their own orgasms, rather than something that I've done. However, taking that step back has made me look at my own experience more often and that it has much more possibility to be more than just a tug and finish, both for personal masturbation and wider. 

I can't help but feel like porn has brainwashed me into thinking sex is a performance, centred around my orgasm but without any encouragement to actually learn about how to enjoy my orgasm.

The questions I've started asking myself are:
What different build ups do I like
When do I prefer faster and slower strokes
What REALLY gets me going both physically and emotionally

Could list more but I have no idea if this is an isolated, personal thing or potentially wider? 

Curious to hear open, honest thoughts - thanks",0
1532,"Hello Everyone,   
So i've searched about it, but everything i found was about guy that couldn't ejaculate because they didn't feel anything  
I do ejaculate quickly (premature actually), but i don't feel anything.  


TLDR, i don't really notice when i'm in my girlfriend or not, some of you may say ""maybe her vagina is too big for me, well even when she give me head, i can't feel her tongue on my glans, sometimes i feel her finger if she stroke with a thight hand but that's all  


It's kinda making the couple life complicated cause she is worry that i don't take pleasure during sex outside ejaculation.  


It may have been from bad masturbation habbits, i'm 26 and she is my first girlfriend, i masturbated a lot before her  


So, is there a way to regain glans sensitivity ? I read about moisturing the glans with hydrating cream, but so far no good.  


Thanks a lot for everyone willling to give advice !  


(don't know if relevant but, like i say i have premature ejaculation, even tho i don't feel pleasure until edging, it takes me 30s-ish to come close to orgasm, and if i do a wecond round, then i can last 5--10minutes, which i'm okay with, so i don't know if it's my glans that don't feel anything, or my brain that don't receive the information, since i do ejaculate quickly)",0
1533,"I'd have to go with David Lynch's The Straight Story. It's a true story about an old man who wants to visit his estranged brother after finding out he had a stroke. Since he can't see well enough to drive a car, he rides a lawnmower 240 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mount Zion, Wisconsin. The movie never discusses why he hasn't seen his brother in so long, and the movie is mostly just him traveling by himself, and when he does talk to people it's nothing really deep or emotional. I won't say exactly what happens, but I will say that it's nothing big or tragic. It's the best depiction of the subtly of male emotions I've ever seen on film, and I feel like it might be too underwhelming for most female viewers if it doesn't go over their head entirely. Honestly, I think The Straight Story (a G-rated Disney production) should be place alongside Fight Club and Gran Torino as one of the essential movies for men.",0

1535,"Depressed, anxious and addicted to porn! Thats my 20s in a broad stroke. Barely any sexual experiences because I was too scared of being rejected and not good enough. Now however after a few years in therapy, having romantic relationships with women is becoming less frightening. But I'm still scared! I'd love to hear from guys getting into the game at an earlier age and how you went about doing it.

1536,"Me and my fiancee don't want kids so for us our 4 yr old Border Collie mix is our baby and he's my best friend.  We got him from a rescue when he was just a baby, and life with him has been amazing since then.  I consider myself a pretty closed off and maybe cold person but he (our pup) has opened my heart more than anyone in my 29 yrs of living.


Tuesday afternoon we took him to the vet because he was seemed disoriented and his hind legs weren't really cooperating with him.  Blood work came back good, and they referred us to a specialist at the ER.  They held him over night, and did an MRI on him this morning and we are currently waiting on the spinal tap results.  They think either inflammation in his brain or he had a stroke.  He's currently in a stable condition but they want to keep him there at least another night to monitor his vitals.


Now me and my fiancee both pretty equally love this dog probably more than life itself so this has not been easy on either of us.  But, for me, I feel like it has broken me.  I've been basically crying for over 24 hours only to stop when I'm sleeping, even being in the office I have to keep my door shut so no one barges in and sees my like this.  My problem is that my brain jumps straight to worst case scenario and jumps to feeling guilty for all the times I played video games instead of spending time with him or putting him in boarding while we went on vacation.  On top of all this, I feel like my fiancee has had to step up and talk to the vet & neurologist because I'm a sobbing mess and can't even speak without sobbing.


Maybe it's because I've lived a cushy life thus far but this has been the most difficult thing I've had to deal with and it's tearing me apart.  How do I stay strong for my pup, and be there for my fiancee when I can't keep it together?

How do guys do this? How can you not have any degree of romantic feeling or not feel anything when you are regularly doing these things with the same person? I guess I'm just naive and/or inexperienced but I cannot understand the emotional/psychological indifference that you can have after sharing these experiences with someone.

&#x200B;

Not to sound offensive or bitter because I might be wrong, but to me, a person must have some deep-rooted form of emotional/psychological damage to be able to shut off their feelings that well with such intimate physical acts of affection.

1544,"Hello. There is a current situation portion, struggle portion, and question portion for those kind to respond.

*Current situation portion*

I am a 25F and my father is dying. He has been diagnosed chronic heart failure, and was already in a sedated state with a many tubes by the time we reached the ICU on Friday evening. He won't wake up anymore, and he won't recover speaking or facial expression functions even if we discontinued medication. I have been back in my home country last December after six years studying and working abroad. My younger brother is still abroad right now, pending visa application after he graduated from university, and can't take a flight back immediately. I met two step-sisters from dad's first marriage who are at least 22 years older than me -- I know very little about them.

*Struggle portion*

My parents had a nasty divorce that was only concluded recently in 2016, and I feel so uncomfortable seeing father now with my mother also there. I don't understand what she is feeling, and being the biggest source of pain, pessimism and reason of low self-esteem for me in the past years, I struggle to sympathise with her. Her and my brother's anger throughout the years towards daddy made me feel guilty for moving forward with my forgiveness, and like I was betraying them if I expressed my love even though I really wanted to + had always been compatible and close to him. We are in day 2 here. After our second medical update and advice from the doctor, I was just standing by the wall, crying for minutes. My mum walked over to me after a while, tried to hold my folded arms firmly, and looked into my eyes as though she wanted to give me support. I started to cry more calmly because it was too odd -- I never would ask my mother for reassurance, and I couldn't read her emotions (i.e. what did she think she was conveying with this.) Then she pulled me into an embrace, perhaps trying to comfort me, when she started to cry too. My mum never hugs me. When she started crying, I froze and became quiet. I couldn't cry...I don't know how to cry when she is also doing the same. I do not feel soothed by her strokes on my back. I have not seen my parents in the same room for a long time. I don't understand too much to switch off my brain and just be with my dad as me.

*Question portion*

My father's vitals are being maintained steadily and forcefully in a relaxed state. But he almost died immediately on Friday afternoon, and would be passing on in the next few days.

What or how should I value in these last final days? What to do in these remaining days? I am so afraid of wasting my time sleeping or eating instead of staying with him. Personally, I am carrying guilt (new and existing) from the inaction and regrets that come from not progressing enough in my trauma to have expressed my love **freely** to my father before this time has come. While for him, I wonder what I can do.

Less immediate, but when his time comes to an end, what are other ways to think about it than ""moving on""? Welcome to any reflections, suggestions, stories, resources, support. Thank you.",0
1545,"I  spent many an hour stroking and fondling my first boyfriend. He said it was his favorite thing in the world to just lay on his back while I caressed him. Often this would either escalate into oral or full sex, but not always. He had a moderate sex drive and sometimes finished on his own if I wasn’t in the mood to go all the way, but he didn’t “have” to.

Fast-forward to boyfriend number two, who has the sex drive of a race car and can go from zero to sixty with so much as a sexy glance. I found out quickly that there is no “in between” for him. If I stroke him even a few times through his pants, or we’re cuddling in bed, he’ll get  blue balls if we don’t take it further (don’t know if this is relevant,  but he’s saving PIV for marriage). I love to massage and caress my  partner as a sign of affection, but I hate that I can’t do it without  him getting insanely horny and having to finish.

1548,"20 years ago they didn't manage how kids pull weight like they do today. I saw some awful shit and took part in some dangerous stuff but came out ok.   The craziest thing I ever saw was at my 1st varsity tournament when I was a freshman. I pulled 19 pounds to get to 130 and felt like hollowed out dog shit.  I had never pulled before and so going that far was quite an experience and I didn't  do it intelligently, starting only 48 hours ahead of time. 

 We show up for weigh in and I make weight and set watching all my teammates step on the scale. It was a pretty big tournament and so there were lots of kids in each  weight.  At 215 pounds,  There was a kid who stood out like a sore thumb from the rest. He already had cauliflower ear  And had a head like a fucking toaster. He was 1st on the scale at his weight and was .3 pounds over. His coach ask him if he can piss, Gave him gum and told him to start spitting and put him on a bicycle. You only have until the end of your weight class to make weight and so the guy only had a few minutes to lose .3 pounds.  Meanwhile his coach is whispering in a teammate's ear and calls the big kid back over. As he walks up his teammate rares back and strokes this kid in the nose and blood went everywhere. As the 215 started after his teammate to whip his ass...the coach grabbed ahold of him told him to calm down and go bleed in the sink. The kid made weight by bleeding off blood.

What about after you have had sex with someone? Would you feel molested if the woman rubbed you when you were asleep or woke you up with a bj?

1552,"Hey dudes!

I’m curious to know at what point after breaking up with someone, do you feel like you’ve made the right decision. I’ve always had an issue with losing people, and don’t have any male influences in my life so I figure this would be the best place to ask.

I feel like seeing multiple scenarios from other men might help me out in my situation, I’ll post mine below this but please feel free to tell me your story if you’d like.

I recently just ended my longest ever relationship of 10 months. Throughout the entire 10 months, there has been maybe a total of 3 weeks that we’ve gone more than 7 days without arguing, which happen to coincide with the times we’ve been on a break. I’ve had to hide hanging out with friends to avoid arguments or jealousy and accusations( one time hanging out with friend and his gf, she asked me to send a picture of them as proof. When I sent one, she claimed it was fake, a saved photo). Often times it feels like I don’t have a choice in decisions, as a “no” or “let me think about it” leads to an argument or her asking again later until I reluctantly agree. It’s gotten to the point where I actively count the days it’s been since an “accident”, and it’s really causing me to lose interest.

Despite this, a tiny sliver of me, probably the part that’s deathly afraid of losing people, is still holding out that we can make things work out. She’s gotten better about alt of the other issues she’s had, and is taking medicine for anxiety and bpd symptoms. The rational side of me is pointing out 10 months of trying. That combined with trying to get back into school, and my mom having a stroke and suddenly being thrust completely into the adult world of bills and career and expectations, that I should be in this kind of environment. How do you guys know you made the right decision to call things off in a relationship?",0
1553,"As a woman I am very comfortable with platonic, friendly affection with my girl friends. We regularly have girls-night-in, watch sweet movies like Anne of Green Gables, snuggle on the floor, hug, play with each others hair, pat/stroke legs, and cry together. In public we hug, pat/ stroke arms, rest heads on each others shoulders, and walk arm-in-arm.
I feel like straight, western men aren't allowed that level of affection with their friends. I actually feel like the way society limits men's platonic physical affection is what leads to the prevelance of many men ""using"" women for sex, because that is really the only acceptable venue for them to experience sustained affectionate touch.
(I don't think thats the only thing that makes men want sex, obviously women who get plenty of affectionate touch still like sex too, but I do think its one reason men seem to crave it a little more desperately and continuously than most women do.)
Men, how comfortable are you with platonic same-sex physical affection? How often do you touch and embrace friends? Do you ever feel like your need for affection is fulfilled enough that it impacts whether or not you feel desperate to connect to another person sexually?",0
1554,"Before I dive in I would like to state that I'm not describing depression. I've had my share of depressive episodes and what I'm describing is not that.

I had serious issues with depression as a teenager. Eventually I got help and once my feet were on the ground I took off like I was trying to make up for all of the lost time. For most of my 20s there was a fire in my chest that grew brighter and hotter every day. I sang in a band, wrote a couple of (really bad) novels and generally threw myself into everything I did... then I hit a rough patch. The most important male figure in my life had a stroke and didn't know who I was anymore, some friends moved away, others proved to not really be friends, a couple of really bad career moves and a string of awful relationships all combined to leave me at the bottom of the deepest, darkest hole I've ever seen. I recovered but it was like someone had turned the volume down on life. It was still pleasant, better in some ways, but where before life was a Heavy Metal concert slowly I realized it had become the classic rock station playing at a reasonable volume.

I'm in my 30s now, I'm happily married, I have friends I can count on, hobbies I enjoy and my career is on the right track. Things are good. Really good.

1555,"I [24M] have experienced a greatly declining quality of health, both physical and mental, for the last 5 years. I know that I'm not supposed to  ask for medical advice but just for the sake of giving ya'll some background I have ADHD, an auto immune disorder, and low testosterone. Although the auto immune thing is under control I've had no luck with the other two. So far none of the meds have worked for ADHD and while the chlomid did greatly boost my testosterone levels I noticed no benefit nor change from it for the last six months. For the last 3 years I have been unbelievably fatigued and it's only gotten worse. It's so bad that no matter how much I sleep I always wake up feeling completely spent. As it is I barely have the energy to do one biggish activity a day and I'm supposed to start welding school this tuesday. So the main thing is that if this is what my life is going to be like for the unforseeable future then I want nothing to do with it. 

As for mental and emotional support I have none. Every single time I've even hinted at not feeling well emotionally my sisters have gotten angry and chewed me out. I also don't have any friends, just acquaintances that don't talk to me. Honestly, at this point the only big thing keeping me alive is my mother. She's currently taking care of my paralyzed father who had a stroke that has also left him being somewhat brain damaged. My death would just be too cruel for her at this time. 

This now brings me to my real question for ya'll. Have any of you committed yourself to the ER for mental health? All of the stories that I've read online make it sound like a hellish mistake. My main hope for going there would be to receive a med that could just knock me out and get some restful sleep for once. Yet I fear that going there will only subject me to more torment and somehow make my life even more unbearable. If you have any personal experience with this then please tell me. I have this deep fear that there is no victory against depression, that no matter what I do it will one day take me.

The thing is that he makes me feel so uncomfortable saying those things and it puts me in a really hard spot because I have to sit in his classroom for the rest of the year and I feel like his comments are getting worse but on the other side I don't want to cause any problems for him because that could backfire. He also stares at me a lot and he touches me sometimes, like when he walked by and stroked my arm or when he shakes me when saying something but that's not as bad as the comments. Other people could hear it and I don't want my classmates to get ideas. I had a teacher that made weird comments last year too but he's not my teacher anymore. It's unfair that I have to go through this again.

I can't tell my mom because she's going to cause drama over this, going to the principal could backfire. I don't know what to say to him, so that's why I'm turning to you guys. I want to handle this in a polite way that doesn't make him hate me.

Sorry for not including this: I'm a girl, 17 years old and in my last year of high school. ",0
1558,"This evening my sister, a local ER triage nurse, told me her last patient of the day died while having sex.  He was 74.  I was very confused.  ""He was having sex in the ER?"", I densely asked.  To make the story snappy:

Old man says to wife, I love you and I just want to touch you.  Old wife agrees and throws back a few drinks as hubby pops a Viagra.  During the deed, dude starts having chest pains so she gives him an aspirin and BOOM.  He had the big one.  He died.  The now widow, told my sister he had a good life, loved her to death and just wanted to touch her and make love to her.  She professed that part of life was ""over"" for her but  she knew how much it meant to him.  I said to my sister, ""Yo, I don't care how old I am sex will never be game over for me!""  You know what she said to me?  ""Well, you get to a certain age after you've had children where you're just not interested in sex anymore.  Too old.""  F that.

Outside of a sincere medical reason should age matter when it comes to sex?  ",0

1560,I(m22) am currently working in the ems field. I went to college for awhile then dropped out. I went back for a career in emergency medicine. During school I absolutely loved the thought of having this job. I enjoyed every aspect of it. I have currently been working in the field for about four months. Working between the ambulance and mediVan ( wheel chair van). So far I have broken down in tears way more than on one occasion by myself never in public or with a patient. The mere thought of work makes my stomach churn. I never have had chest pains in my life and I have a history of heart problems. I have started this job and I had a little bit of chest pain. I am completely over eating or under eating. This morning I was extremely dizzy ( I never get that).  I'm not stupid I know this job is stressing me out more than I have ever been through. Am I just still new or is there something more? I really love the field and sometimes I enjoy my job and sometimes I feel like I'm going to shatter. What are your thoughts ?  ,0
1561,"So there are a million and one threads about whether women find it a turn-off or even lose respect to platonic male friends who are vulnerable, going through a hard time, or simply lack perfect emotional composure. 

I will be honest. I find intergender relationships of ANY sort stressful. I am a highly sensitive person, with an anxiety disorder, it gives me shit, it's the biggest turn off possible I know, sucks, and it genuinely hurts to have to be around women for too long. As in physical pain, cortisol rises, it's tiring, I have had chest pains or headaches, in the past I've lost sleep from getting too close. I have to hide my authentic self. (The exception is with mother figures, usually women old enough to be my grandma, or therapists/doctors.) This is any woman my age; my friends, my SOs, whatever. I just do not trust them in that way. My dad tried it and paid the price for it. All my friends who did, got screwed over. 

I don't know how to handle this bar to opt out of society and go live as a hermit, but that's a shitty non-existence and something has to pay the bills. 

So, given I have to interact with them, but because of the nature of the game cannot be GENUINE when interacting with, must always perform and keep the wall up...how do I forgive them for unintentionally inflicting pain all the time and myself for being so...you know? Over sensitive? Again, I am trying to accept, it's not a conscious choice to disrespect guys of my nature, they cannot help it. (Generalisations of course, not all are like that)",0
1562,"Here's my little story. Never, ever had any anxiety problem. Never had performance anxiety, never thought i would due when i felt pain somewhere in my body, never. It was the end of june, i was at my house with my girlfriend, and for the first time my 'friend' didn't get up. I was pretty stoned, i laughed about it and we watched a movie. I used to masturbate once a day or every other day, so after a couple of days i went to masturbate and flop, nisba. I got this kind of erection like just some drops of blood had entered in it, no hardness at all. I decided to rest a week or so and try again with my girlfriend. Same problem. My girlfriend left for 2 months to study abroad, I stopped smoking weed to try and see what happened. Nothing changed, no morning woods, started to lose sex drive, developed a kind of anxiety, lowest self-esteem ever. One time, after work, i decided to smoke a joint to relax, but I didn't get high at all, I just had a syncope. Felt my throat closing and fainted. Did a lot of test from that moment on: blood pressure is perfect, generic blood tests are perfect, Psa (prostatic blood test) is perfect, blood saturation (the one measured from a finger) is perfect, testosterone levels are perfect, my brain is perfect (depression lead me to have a MRI, thought I was fucked up), electrochardiogram is perfect. They told me to relax, that everything is in my mind. I accepted that, said ok, if docs say so, that must be true. Still nothing. I'm taking cialis now as advised by my doctor, but i still don't know. I have strange symptoms. I feel like always having something down in my throat, I sigh ALOT during the day, I'm short of breath, I feel weak (I've been doing sport my entire life) and a sensation of chest pain/closing when I do even little exercise. 
Well, if any of you has anything to say that can help me, it would be great.
Thanks in advance to everyone for your time.

1564,"Hey Everybody,

This might just be a petty problem but here it goes.

I (25/M) met a girl (24/F) traveling last January, we wanted to continue things and were together for 7 months. In that 7 months she broke up with me 3 times (Thought I didn't like her, felt something was missing, then claimed she didn't see a future with me and didn't think I meant it when I said I love you). After the 3rd time I told her not to contact me. She came crawling back saying it hurt how much she missed me and then just as I thought we were going to maybe get back together and work things out, she ghosted, strung me along, and said it was depression.


A few months pass, I go away, delete and block her on Facebook after she tries to re add me as a friend. And back in October she started contacting me again wanting to ""Meet Up"" and ""Catch up"" with me. There was a bit of talking and after my friends and family told me not to meet up with her I finally mustered up the courage to tell her ""I don't want to stay in contact anymore, I don't want to see you, you're not my favourite person, I don't trust you, thanks for the memories, all the best etc."" It felt like a weight off my shoulders at first but then I felt sad for a bit. 


December was an incredible month, being with friends, celebrating the holidays, and just doing my own thing.
Last night I got drunk at a birthday party and went home wasted. I was on Instagram looking at a friends page when I came across my exes name. Curiosity got the worst of me and I clicked on her profile. The first picture I see is from New Years of her and her new boyfriend. I immediately started to cry. Even when you think you're somewhat over someone the feelings still rush back and the pain sinks in. I began to cry horribly. It didn't help I was drunk either.


Today all I can think about is her and her new man. Obviously whatever she does is out of my control and it was inevitable she would meet someone its just I didn't want to know about it. It was my mistake for even prying. What is a good way to get over this awful feeling? Just continue what Ive been doing? I know this sounds like a petty problem I just had to get it off my chest.


TLDR - Saw a picture of my ex and her new boyfriend. Felt hurt. How to get over this feeling?",0
1565,"I was with one guy from the time I was 16 (married at 21) until we divorced at 28.  Obviously in a marriage you fart around each other all the time.  I've been with my boyfriend for seven months.  Tonight we were snuggled on the couch lying down watching tv and he kept shifting uncomfortably and making a pained face.  I asked if he was okay and he said his stomach was bugging him.  I could hear/feel the gas ripping around in his stomach but he was apparently holding it in.

I tried to find a respectful and non-awkward way to say ""you can just fart, it's fine"" but he's a VERY private, quiet guy.  I really didn't want to embarrass him, so I stroked his belly/chest.  When he ran to the bathroom I got up and did the dishes to cover the sound.  He eventually went home instead of sleeping over, I'm guessing in part because he felt so crappy (ha no pun intended)  from holding it all in.  We're both quiet introverts and I would be totally embarrassed to fart in front of him, so I get his reluctance.

When did you fart in front of your S/O?",0
1566,"I'm talking about **LOVE**, like the kind you rarely feel towards another person.

Normally, I'm really jaded about romance and women and love and all that stuff, and it's normally a giant hole in me that I do my best every day to ignore. But several things have prompted me to fall into one of those phases where I yearn for love and become painfully aware of every hand-holding couple and love song. And I've been reading about being compassionate towards animals and people and blah blah blah.

I was absolutely crazy about a close female friend in high school. And a few years after graduating, back in December, we met up while she was in town, and I nonchalantly told her about how I'd felt for her. She told me that I should've told her. Unfortunately for me, she's now in a relationship with a man she loves, and we're separated by hundreds of miles. And I'm somehow even *more* attracted to her. But it was nice to finally get that off my chest.

But what she said stuck with me. **I think if you love someone, you should tell them, if even just to boost their ego a bit.**

A year ago, I started hanging out with a girl whom I gradually fell for. She was my best friend for a while, and she really admired me. But I was reasonably sure that she didn't like me more than platonically. And once she got a boyfriend, I stopped hanging out with her, because (1) they were an amazing match, (2) I didn't need to be constantly reminded of that, and (3) the boyfriend was pretty aware of my feelings, and I didn't want him to feel like I was encroaching.

Anyway, now she's single, and we see each other once every week or two. We're not as close as we used to be, but I still love her. Yesterday, I was reminded of what my high school friend had said, and so, on a whim, I texted my current friend about my feelings towards her, downplaying it as no big deal (but kinda, because I'm so cool and she should be flattered).

I don't think I had really anything to lose. I don't even expect her to love me back, but I'd like to think that I flattered her. And this is the first time I've ever explicitly told a girl I ""love"" her, so it's a growing experience for me. If the friendship ends, then, well, so be it. She's no longer in my core group of friends, and, frankly, if she were to leave my life at this point, I wouldn't lose much.

If someone loved me like I've loved either of these two girls, I think I'd like to know. I'm not aware of anyone who's ever liked me to such an extent. There might be some exceptions, but overall I think it'd be better if people were more upfront about this. 

Overall, do you guys think there are situations where you *shouldn't* tell someone you love them?

Any stories?

Any advice?",0
1567,"A little background.  I met my fiancee ""Claire"" while she was a senior in college interning at my workplace that I had been at for two years.  Truth be told we hit it off very fast and started dating soon thereafter, and when her internship was done we entered an exclusive relationship.  Everything was GREAT at first.  Hardly ever argued, great sex, cuddling, and we had so many interests in common like the same food and bands that we always had things to talk about.  The relationship continued to go just as well even as she started her new job after graduation, not where I worked by the way, and despite less time to see each other we still made it work.

The first bump in the road so to speak came one day after Claire had gone out with a few colleagues to a bar for a round of drinks.  This wasn't the first time she'd done this, and I understood workplace politics, so I never had an issue with it.  I had invited her over for dinner which I usually did two or three times a week, but she didn't come over until well after an hour I had expected her to and was much more inebriated than usual.  I confronted her about it gently asking her what had happened and she was very defensive at first.  She yelled at me that I was being ""too fucking nosy"" but eventually started crying.  I stroked her hair and she broke down and told me that one of her co-workers, ""Jeff"", had insisted that she stay a bit longer and continue drinking with her.  She explained how Jeff had seniority over her and that she didn't want to appear to be anything but a 'team player' and had left early on previous occasions and gotten flack over it, so she stayed.  Claire told me that she and Jeff continued to drink for another hour or so and Jeff was progressively making the conversation a little more flirty.  She felt nervous and a little bit intimidated but followed suit so as to not make things uncomfortable.  Eventually Jeff started to get a little handsy and Claire was so nervous that she just kind of froze up.  After they finished and they were walking out, he even reached in for a kiss.  At this point in recounting the story Claire was crying so much that I just continued to stroke her hair and listen even though I was a little bit annoyed.  She was so petrified as Jeff went in to kiss her that she just stood there and let it happen, and then once they separated vomited into the nearest trashcan.  I reassured her that it was not her fault but that I would strongly prefer that she not see Jeff outside of the work environment.  She told me that she would avoid one on one interaction but it wouldn't be possible to avoid him entirely as he is almost always part of the group that goes out for after work drinks, and she can't stop going to those.  I was a little mad about it, but I agreed and compromised.

A little more than a year later and things are seemingly going as well as ever.  Claire still does after work bar excursions with her colleagues, but she was recently promoted in part because of it and Jeff left to work somewhere else!  So that was a relief.  We had since moved in together, which just felt right and resulted in us feeling as close to each other as ever, at least emotionally.  To be honest I thought we'd be having sex more often than before, but in actuality shortly after the novelty wore off we were having it less and less, even though we would still cuddle as often as before.  The real problem came up about 6 months after she had moved in, when sometime in the mid afternoon I got an unexpected picture message from Claire of her nude in a bathroom.  This was really weird because for one we never sexted.  My phone was one provided by my work and as such it was against company policy for any kinds explicit texts to be sent to it which I had told her in the past.  I didn't want to say anything in case this was a big surprise and she was feeling rather amorous, but when she got home she didn't so much as bat an eye at me or bring up the picture, which I found very odd.  I know I shouldn't have broken her trust like this, but when she went to use the bathroom and took her phone from her purse, and looked up her messaging log.  While the timestamps for the pic matched my and her phone and the numbers, unfortunately I saw an extensive conversation with a guy she had under her phone as ""Mike"" which had been taking place that day, and for a few weeks it seemed, that was very sexually explicit.  No mention of an actual encounter thank god, but a lot of talk from him about how horny he was and how he was jerking it to the thought of her, and texts from Claire, which really hurt to read, about how wet she was thinking about it and such, along with another nude pic she had sent to him last week.  I didn't say anything about it to her until dinner, when I brought up the nude pic that she had sent me, and she said she had no idea what I was talking about.  At that point I told her I had looked through her phone and had seen all her conversations with Mike and the pic that she had sent him.  Instead of defending herself however she suddenly got furious and was screaming at me about violating her privacy and looking through 'her' stuff and being too controlling, and slammed the bedroom door in my face.  After a half an our or so I went in there to talk to her after not hearing anything and by this time she was on the bed sobbing into the pillow.  She told me how sorry she was and that she'd never let it happen again and that they'd never actually slept together, much to my relief, and that the whole thing had escalated when Mike, another more senior co-worker, had called her hot and started sending flirty text messages, and she felt compelled to not making any waves, and had gotten caught up in everything.  I rubbed her shoulders as she told me the truth and forgave her.  She decided to spend that weekend up visiting her mother to clear her head, and I agreed.  She agreed not to have any more contact with Mike beyond strictly work related talk, so that was a relief.  We kissed but didn't make love that night, but held each other close instead.

Funny enough, I felt the catharsis had made the relationship better than ever, despite the roadbump.  However, a nagging part of me was still a little bit concerned.  I wanted to really tie up any loose ends and cement our relationship as permanent.  So I went out, bought a ring, and proposed to her shortly after she came back from her mother's house.  Much to my relief, she didn't hesitate and said yes, and we got engaged.  This was back in 2011.  Unfortunately, things have gotten much worse in the last nine months.  Last september, right after we had just finished making love, which unfortunately we seemed to be only doing once a week at most, she started crying again.  While I was holding her head to my chest she confessed to me that she had had a moment of weakness and slept with Mike twice over the summer, and she felt like killing herself for it because the guilt was too much.  Surprisingly my emotions of fury was overcome by concern over the talk of suicide, and I told her that I still loved her very much.  She went on to explain that she thinks she might be a nymphomaniac and that sometimes she gets so aroused at work that a primal part of her brain takes over, and that's why she had gone home with Mike those two times during lunch because of it, and she was sickened by it.  Unfortunately she made it clear she still had those feelings and didn't know what to do.  She told me she loved me more than anything and that sex with Mike was just sex for pleasure, not like making love to me.  She told me the urges were making her consider suicide because she couldn't stand what she was doing to me.  She had cut herself in the past so I was very concerned hearing about any suicidal tendencies.  For her safety, I agreed to an open relationship stipulating that if she can't help it, she could see mike for sexual satisfaction as long as she used protection.  She told me how sorry she was, and that she'd seek therapy as soon as we could afford it, and that she'd quit her job after we got married and stop seeing Mike.  It was a really hard choice to make because I felt sick thinking about her in the arms of another man, but I really love her and I didn't want to risk losing her.  For the first few weeks she only slept again with Mike once, and for the first time in a long time we started making love more often.  It did not last long however, and earlier this year our lovemaking frequency dropped precipitously and while I didn't ask how often she saw Mike, I suspected she was seeing him more often.  

The painful part came at the start of the spring.  She broke down and started crying as we were discussing wedding plans and told me in addition to Mike, she had started sleeping with ""Chris"" recently, a guy she apparently met at a conference that she and Mike attended in the city.  She told me she felt like a slut and a whore for violating our agreement and that she didn't deserve to marry me and that she felt like killing herself again.  I was pretty mad about the revelation she had slept with someone we hadn't agreed to or talked about, but again my love for her and out of concern with her safety, I forgave her.  She told me she hated the feeling of going into their apartments and it made her feel awful and uncomfortable.  She told me she'd feel much better if she could bring Mike and Chris here into our home instead, so that it felt more sanctioned and under my control.  I really put my foot down, but I just couldn't get over how sad she was still in tears, and patted her head and told her it was okay.  This is the part I kind of regret now.  At first she'd bring over one of them while I was at work, but in the last six weeks she has brought Mike or Chris over in the evening while I was here cooking!  I haven't talked to her about it because I know how fragile she is about the situation and I don't want to make her uncomfortable.  I almost lost it when she brought Chris to the table for dinner I had prepared afterwards, but I didn't want to say anything, and he did seem like a nice guy.  If she has them over late i'll sleep on the couch and wait until they leave to enter the bedroom, where Claire is usually crying.  Sometimes we'll make love again even while she's still in tears.  Even this I could stand, it wasn't until last week when I was already sleeping, that she brought Mike into our bedroom after midnight and they fooled around as quietly as they could next to me.  I pretended I was asleep at first but didn't bother after her hair kept falling into my face, and just held it for her until they finished and Mike left, and cuddled with her as she started crying again.

I'm writing this because last weekend she told me she really wants to set the date for our wedding and get the invitations out.  I couldn't say it to her, but at this point i'm not sure if I can go through with it.  I could deal with her self medicating by seeing other men strictly for sex, but it's too close to home at this point.  I don't think I can marry someone with nymphomania.  I am deadly afraid to tell her because I really don't want her to do anything to herself, but at the same time I can't deal with her bringing men into our bedroom anymore. 

What should I do reddit?  Insist that she get psychological treatment before we get married?  Set a hard limit on where she's allowed to see Mike and Chris?  Delay the wedding?  I'm afraid either way of how she'll react and I still love her more than anything and don't want her to hurt herself.",0
1568,"Alright time for some real man talk. Me and my gf broke up awhile now about 2 and half years, I ignored her for a long time. I messed around with some chicks, but never really had any feelings for them. I turned cold hearted after the break up. When I think back my ex was a real good gf did alot for me, but I was a boss, high on life and chicks only want u when u a boss. Now I grad college moved back home, fucking hard to find girls and no girls want me. 

No interest, my love life is non-existent, I work, socialize with girls at work, but no potential and everyone is older than me. I am going back to a different school to take some classes so there is something to look forward to. I deleted my ex from all my contacts the day we broke up, but sometimes her friends post pictures and you see stuff. I used to see pics with her and her bf and it feels like someone punched me in my chest at first, now the pain feels ALOT less, but it still hurts a little whenever I see those pics, with her and this new guy. I think about her every once in awhile, but starting to think about her more when my life is sucking. Nothing really going on for me atm. I think about just posting pics of me with girls I messed with in college on my social media like facebook cause I know she would get mad jealous, but I leave my fb dead. Life has its ups and downs, so I had my downs now I am waiting for the ups. 

The feelings I have is loneliness and the fact that I haven't found anyone yet, while my ex jumps from one guy after another. I only had 1 gf, so it makes me question myself like will I ever get another girl? Was that it for me? It took a fucking long time to build up that relationship where you guys have similar goals, helping each other out, deep bond with someone where you are so comfortable with one another to act yourself. Does your feelings of your first love goes away? We had a real bad break up that left me bitter for some time. I am a little bitter, I wanna be successful with a great career, genuinely happy with my life, and have a hot wife who I love.... Then my ex tries to talk to me or if I ever see her when I am successful just look at her and laugh, that would be awesome. If I had other gfs then I probably wouldn't feel this way, but the fact that she was my only gf prob is the reason for these feelings from time to time. Usually I don't really fret about her much, but when those pics of her with her bf pop up from mutual friends posts, it brings back these feelings that I have buried deep down. I have been hitting a dry spell for a LONG time, sucks. What is your guys feelings on your first love?",0
1569,"The question part:

Do you have that one girl who got away? The one who seemed like everything you could possibly want but you could never close with her? The girl who every time you see her face your brain shuts down and your mouth locks up and the words that are bursting out of your heart just don't come? The girl who you would risk everything in your life now just to have one more chance with? Has your time with someone ever made you a better person, the person you needed to be to get them in the first place, but now it's too late?

How do you get over that? When someone consumes so much of your being how can you make peace with the fact you couldn't make it work with them? How do you cope with the fact that you were not good enough to prevent a person that you would give up your life for from hurting?

Bonus question for the women reading this, have ever been on the receiving end of this? Has a guy every been completely helpless to your feminine wiles to the point of social paralyses? Do you notice and what do you think about him?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reason for said question:

tl;dr/ The following true events contain a bunch of white knighting, betaness, and general bitchassness. It is the ""highlights"" of a long and sordid tale of pain and sorrow. Yes, I am aware that I am pathetic, I did the best I could under the circumstances but that has been small consolation so far. I apologize for the length but this is 18 years condensed into a few paragraphs.

I changed to a new school going into the eighth grade so I didn't know anyone or have any friends so being fat and generally awkward I just kept my head down and tried to keep to myself. One day during a class change I was at my locker and looked down the hall to see one of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen. I asked one of my locker mates who she was and he said ""Thats Jessica, she's a slut."" She had the body of a grown woman at 13, triple D breasts with big full hips on a thick and curvy frame. She has a soft, cute face with an easy smile and the palest blue eyes.

Fast forward to ninth grade, I go to my third period which was PE and I take my usual seat at the side. I only participated once a week to keep myself from failing, fat kid after all. Guess who should walk in and sit down beside me, as a chubby girl herself and a teenage smoker I guess PE wasn't her thing either. We strike up an easy conversation and over the course of the next few weeks become fast friends. We tease and flirt with each other, we're like an old married couple, calling each other horrible names and ribbing each other but never crossing the line into hurt feelings. She is very funny with a quick wit, these times are the most fun I've ever had with a woman with my clothes on. We dress out for PE on the same day each week so no one is left alone for a day and no matter what day of the week we do it seems like that day in the day our class runs laps around the gym. Because of her physical endowments she runs with her arms crossed  folded across her chest to keep everything in check. Our gym teacher was an old pervert and after a couple days of this he started yelling at her ""Run, Jessica run! Put your arms down and run right!"" She never put her arms down but he would still watch her run around the gym. I always ran with her anyway but I started running around her in a way to block his vision of her as we circled the gym. After he noticed this he added telling me to move to his yelling. We never really talked about it but it was something I did to make me feel better, I couldn't stand to let her be perved on like that. During this time I was her shoulder to cry on as guys would get with her, get what they wanted from her, and dump her. The level of attention that body brought would be hard for a grown woman to endure, much less a child. I tried to tell her I was interested but the right words just never came out. I tried to not act like a horny 14 year old around her and treat her with respect hoping that that would win the day, I didn't have confidence in my looks since fat with a big scar on your face wasn't a type I was aware of. I never felt fully confident in our relationship, she would be warm and friendly some days and then go cold for few. I felt like if I could ever string a couple of weeks together of her being consistently friendly I would feel more confident in myself and be able to tell her how I felt. I didn't realize until much later that getting a woman to like you about half the time is about as much as I can expect.

Forward again to later in the year, we are in the classroom ""health"" part of the year doing some assigned reading. I sit with her on my right so we can chat and I notice her digging in her purse from which she retrieves a blue plastic razor. She breaks the blade part in half and begins to cut a guys name into the inside of her left arm from her elbow to her wrist. I start calling to her telling her to stop and she just keeps dragging the blade through her skin. Blood is pouring from her arm, tears are rolling down her face and I am freaking the fuck out to the point that I am screaming at her to stop. The teacher was out of the room, probably in his ""office"" drinking. She went to the bathroom to get cleaned up while I just sit there in shock. I don't think I spoke to her for the next day or two, I was just numb, I am tearing up just reliving it now. We slowly started talking again but I was very cautious, I didn't know how to handle the amount of pain that would cause someone to do that, this was 17/18 years ago and I had never heard of or seen cutting. This was very much baptism by fire.

Moving along, we go to the next semester and we're back in the gym. Since we both sat out most of the time we made it into the gym before everyone else almost every day. One day I walk in the see her standing on the opposite side of the gym where we sit, she's wearing a brown dress with little pink and white flowers that comes just above her knees and little black baby doll shoes. She looks me in the face and smiles and then turns around and stretches as far as she can go and exposes her panty hose covered behind to me then turns back with another smile. I finish walking up to her and say ""You might not ought to stretch like that again because your whole butt hangs out when you do."" She playfully pushes me in the chest and says ""What were you looking for?"" and walks away. I couldn't understand what happened, I though I was just keeping my friend from embarrassing herself. I had completely buried my sexual response to her because other guys were causing her so much pain, I wouldn't even whack it to her because I didn't want to start seeing her in that way. I missed the signal that she was finally ready for me because I was too scared to hurt her. When you feel unattractive you think you only have one shot to get it right and the moment has to be perfect so I whiffed when she threw one right over the plate. I didn't fully realize that it was a sign until some years later.

We have arrived at the end of the school year, at this point I am unaware that she might be interested in me as boyfriend material and I know I will be losing contact with her over the summer. Since we weren't dating I had a couple of other irons in the fire and I was doing about as well with them as I was her. A week before the end of school my parents decide we're going to the beach, I tell them I don't want to go so they leave and I'm home with my grandmother. A friend of my sisters from church that I had been talking to calls and asks for my sister and I tell her that she is headed to the beach. She then starts talking to me and invites me to a group outing for some young people from church. I go and by the end of the night I have a girlfriend. At first I went with her to gain some experience and confidence in hopes of taking another crack at the other girl next school year. This turned out to be woman I am married to now. When I got back to school Monday I told my guy friend in a way the other girl could hear that I had a girlfriend for the summer. Since I missed her signal I still felt like she wasn't interested yet and  I wanted her to know another girl found me interesting enough to ask me out. A few days later school ends, I got perfect attendance that year. That was the only time in my life I never missed a day of school, I hated school and laid out as much as humanly possible. I got up every day that year hoping that that would be the day I would say or do something that would make her love me like I did her.

Tenth grade starts and disaster, we don't have any classes together. I track her down at lunch after a few days and she blows me off. After a few more conversations I keep getting the cold shoulder so I kind of drift away from her. I'm still dating the girl from church and it is getting pretty serious by this point, we have a lot in common and she is more my ""speed"". The girl from school is like having a tiger by the tail, I'm hanging on for dear life every day. I am very much in the back seat with her while with the girl from church I have enough confidence to take the lead even though she is two years older than me. The relationship isn't as fun but things happen at a pace that I can keep up with. I end up failing the tenth grade due to absences and since my girlfriend is already out of school I quit so I can get a job. At his point I am happy, I don't think about school girl too much but dark days are ahead.

I have a sister who is a year younger than me, my wife was her friend before we started dating. She was still in school after I quit and sometime around the end of my what would have been my eleventh or the start of my twelfth grade year (1998) she tells me that my friend from school has gotten pregnant. I am crushed, I am despondent, this is what I had been trying to protect her from all along. I wanted to run to her and take care of her but I was 17 with no job, how was I going to take care of her and a baby that wasn't mine? So I bury it, I've got a girl friend and she's great and we're making plans to get married.

In April 2005, about a month before my sixth anniversary I'm driving through my hometown and pass a familiar face I haven't seen in years. I hadn't really thought about her much about but I did want to say hey so I whip around and follow her a few streets down until she pulls in somewhere. I hop out and we talk for almost an hour. I ask her how she's doing and she says ""I'm a bitch"" I tell her that I miss her and she says she misses me too, that old spark is still there. We talk about family, she married her babies daddy and now has two kids, I don't have any because my wife is sick. Our school ROTC was attached to the Marines and her husband had recently finished six years in with the last few in Iraq, he had been stationed at Camp LeJuene so she wasn't terribly far away from home. The four of them were then living in a motel room not far away from where we were. She asked me to come see her, she was a waitress at a chain restaurant in town. She was starting to accumulate garbage tattoos, just random graffiti on her beautiful body. One in particular concerned me, a blackish square on the inside of her left wrist with visible slash marks in it. I wasn't trying to date her but I needed to get some closure on this. I went home and told my wife I ran in to her and that she wanted to meet her and asked us to come see her. This did not go over well. It turns out that my wonderful sister told my wife back when we were dating that my guy friend and I threewayed this girl right after I started dating my wife and she has sat on this information until just now. This was a huge deal because we were virgins when we got married and no amount of talking was convincing her that that didn't happen, which it really did not. The whole goal of me trying to date her was to give her a chance to slow down a be a kid for a while, even if I had been able to date her sex would have been off the table for a while until she had healed. Anyway, this whole event ruins our sixth anniversary. A few months later when everything has cooled down I sneak up to where she works and catch her sitting outside just after closing. I apologize for my absence and partially explain the havoc that our earlier encounter wrought, we're still playful and joking with each other. I told her that my wife really hates her to which she replies that she really hates my wife too.

As my wife and I went through our seventh year together things got pretty bad, not really because of this but other unresolved issues and a house that was falling apart around us. Seeing this girl again and not being able to resolve it was the worst thing that could happen. My wife also has some unresolved issues with some people from school and I have always been there for her when she needed to talk about it, I even encouraged her to look them up on Myspace during this time and since, so she could get the closure I so desired. I just could not get her out of my mind and I would wallow in self pity, knowing that I had let her down, this was increased by my marital problems because now the woman I was with hated me too. Over a few years I kind of got this inferno tamped down to a slow burn and my wife and I got our shit together again.

This is the last paragraph, I promise. About a year and a half ago I moved to a new town and about six months ago I started seeing a familiar face driving around again, fuck. Every time I see her it all comes flooding back again, I am confronted with my greatest failure. If I had only failed myself I could live with it, I am used to paying the price for my own incompetence but to get someone I care about so much swept up in it too has been unbearable. This gets us to last week, I saw her walking across the parking lot of our local grocery store. Almost every time I see her she has one or both of her kids with her so I keep my distance but this time she is alone so I go up and say hi. We have a small exchange, this time the fire is gone. I ask if I can come see her one day and she says no, I guess this is the most closure I can hope for. Every time I talk to her I'm 14 again, stuck in some time rift of my own making. I can't think, the words burning through my chest won't come out. She probably thinks I'm a crazy person but at least she isn't waiting on me anymore. I wish I could tell her how I feel about her, I wish I could tell her that she made me a better person. I learned how to love a woman by being around her, I learned how to not be jealous of someones past by dealing with hers. I learned how to put someone elses interests ahead of my own. I learned so much and I still failed.",0
1570,"This is a throwaway account. And I do apologize for the wall of text. I'm currently a student in graduate school. I met the guy in question when he did a big favor for one of the organizations I'm involved in. We have some friends in common and are friendly to each other. With the exception of a date auction (where he would have been auctioned off for $5 dollars had I not bid on him) we've never been out on a date. And on the date which turned out to be a group thing anyway its wasn't by any means romantic or feel even date like. Nor has he ever asked me out on one. 

A few weeks ago, we were playing drunk monopoly with a group of friends at my apartment and he ended up being invited by someone who was there. As everyone was leaving I started to make food and he asked if he could have some, I said sure. We were both pretty intoxicated talked a little and then somehow ended up having sex. 

Next morning he left and when we saw each other things seemed fine and beside the two random texts nice shirt, your legs look good in that dress there was no flirting or dates/plans set for the two of us. And not the clothes comment he sort of flirts with everyone so it didn't find it too telling that he was doing it with me. 

So there is this big party that's thrown every year. He and I were going to both be in attendance. But I also had a girl friend from out of town coming and spending the night with me. This party, nice dinner with open bar for three hours then drinking and dancing at a club is notorious for getting students obliterated. 

I end up catching a cab home with my friend, this guy and another guy. The guy in question doesn't actually live in out apt building but our building is between where we were and his place. Instead of staying in the car he got out. Walked us in the building and then asked to come up because he really had to use my bathroom. I felt bad saying no so I said sure but that my friend and I were going to go to sleep soon. 

My friend goes to shower and I went to get water in the kitchen and when I turn around he;s there he picks me up and puts me so i'm sitting on the counter. we kiss for a few seconds and then he says something along the lines of needing me so badly...he tires to kiss me again and I turn my check and tell him. That, that's nice but I wasn't going to happen. 

**Now everything before here has been background/context, I'm not sure I would have had sex with him again but I didn't have an issue entertaining the idea until after this point**

So after I say no he asks why. And I tell him I have a friend spending the night and she's sleeping in my bed. And even if she wasn't here I wouldn't have sex because I have my period. At this point he starts to get a little more aggressive, pushing against me as I'm trying to gently push him away. and then he says he doesn't care about my period and I reply that I do and repeat again its not going to happen tonight. He asks about my plans for the next day and I tell him i'm busy until 2am. Then gestures to the couch and says well we don't have to have sex, I again say that I'm not really into it I just want to shower and sleep (its 4am at this point) 

Then he very forcefully grabs my arm and pulls me on to the floor and I slam my feet on to the hard floor. And I had been in heels for 16 hours that day so my feet screamed in pain when he did that. So I yelled, he got all defensive that I was mad. I said I get that you didn't mean to hurt me but you did. And I tell him I'm going to sleep now he should leave. 

**Now, I personally thought he was a little too persistent and perhaps aggressive that evening, but I chalked it up to being very drunk and well horny, it was defensively making me lean towards not want to ever have sex with him but he's still a decent guy and I say no reason to have to avoid or confront him about it.**

But then...Thursday he wrote asking if i was going to X's bday party. And I told him that 1) I'm super sick and won't be going anywhere this weekend and 2) I wasn't invited so no. Friday while I'm sleeping in trying to get over this sinus infection and chest cold i get a text from my roomate. Hey (the guy) wants to know our apt # are you okay with me giving it to him. I thought that was odd because he knows she and I are roommates. and while they know each other and have classes together they've never hung out unless they were with their section.

I go and talk to our roommate and ask her if she knows why he's asking, she says no and asks. he says I was thinking about dropping by to say hi. She tells him she's too swamped to have people over. and he shouldn't go out of his way to come here (and because he doesn't live here and school is several block away it is out of the way). He asks for the apt number anyway. I tell her I don't  know if I want her to give it to him becuase it all seems odd. She says she can't just not give it to him when he asked. So she does. 

20 minutes later the phone rings from downstairs. I had ordered food so I thought it might have been a delivery no its security telling me they're sending the guy up. I say  hold and go to the roommate and asking if she told him to drop anyway after saying she was too busy. She said No. I tell her she can deal with him while I go back to bed because I wasn't in a fit state to see company. 

The phone rings and this time it is my delivery my roommate comes and tells me, that he's still her. I asked what he wanted to see her about and she said, well he dropped by to see how I was doing. When I come back up with the food, I hear him say oh is that randomthrowaway141. And while I'm getting a a water I turn around he's there. We change Hi's he says something like wow you sound worse then me. He gives me an hug. and then tells me that like we talked about the other night he's spoken for the next evening but we should get together this weekend. I replied with I'm so sick I'm only going to be sleeping this weekend and with finals around the corner who knows when there will be a free moment. He then leaves. 

I ask my roommate what they talked about and she said nothing really he just wanted to see how you were doing. She said she thought that was kind of nice. I however find it odd and it doesn't sit well.  If he really wanted to see how I was doing, why would he not text me? I have not avoided or not responded to any of the messages he's sent me which have been very few. 

So here's my questions...What is the best way to approach this situation? Because given the overly aggressive night and the fancy running into you here in your own apt, I really just want to close the door on this guy.

Was the I doubt I'll be free until finals a good enough clue that he should take the hint? Should I be more direct? Or should I not do anything at all and just avoid being around him as much as possible? 

**TLDR: Had sex with guy once, he didn't like taking no for an answer the second time but left, told him I was sick the next day drops by to see my roomie who told him not to drop by as a pretense to see me. How do I get him to back off?** ",0

1572,"Kind of personal and grim, I do apologise for that in advance.

My grandpa who is nearing 70 has had a bypass and the doctor told him that the most important thing to do for recovery is walking as his extremities can still clog up and constrict since he is very overweight. However, he's kind of resigned on improving his condition because it hurts.

He used to be a heavy smoker and has problems with fine hand manipulation as his ligaments are extremely damaged from years working in a mine. Nowadays he can't even mow the lawn because of his condition and it's getting worse by the day.

I bring this here because I learned a lot about what it is to be a man from him even though we were never particularly close and it physically pains me to see him like this. He's a very hard man with a passion for maintenance work, but virtually no social life and hobbies.

We are at wits end about how we could help him as our recent attempt to get through to him ended up in him telling his own daughter that 'he is just waiting to die'.

It is a lot but do any of you have any advice? I'd be really grateful for anything at this point. Thanks.

EDIT: Wow, this thread really took of when I was asleep! I didn't expect that. Thank you all for voicing your ideas, you're an awesome community of genuine people.

I will be seeing him this week to see if I can interest him in offering help with some work on the car. Also, I'll try to convince my grandma to cook more healthily. It's a start and I don't expect it to be easy but I will try my best. This discussion also made me realize that I actually don't know much about his life so I'll try to rectify that while there's still time.

Thanks a bunch, again. Best regards.",0
1573,"I broke up with a guy after seeing a girl post him and her kissing over social media. But what lead up to that discovery was me mistrusting and going on his profile, checking this girl like his posts often, feeling extremely uncomfortable when he mentioned her. Vibe was all off but still didn't justify my paranoia. 


My anxiety and panics became so bad I'd come to him uninvited when having a breakdown. Then leave calmer but ashamed for demanding random meetuos during anxiety attacks. Then check his social media and become territorial. I hated this part of myself and removed that toxic draw all together after the breakup. He was angry I had seen flirtatious posts, the pic as violation. What he did was clearly wrong but I'm owning up to my faults. Im seeing a therapist, working out etc. I don't ever want to be that girl again--univited, paranoid. 


I don't want anxiety and distrust to spill into other relationships. How do you prefer/do balance social media with an SO? There are simple things like don't look or be paranoid but this seems to be a common issue between couples and I wanna bypass it.

1575,"Backstory: 5 years ago I was fooling around with a friend that I wanted a relationship with. She ended up choosing a former gang member 10+ years older than her that had a few kids of his own. A few months into her mistake she started talking to me again, sounding like she wanted to jump ship....which is what I wanted. We flirted through texts, he found them, and she was banned from talking to me. 

I had zero contact with her until this year - both of them moved into my city. They live on a tiny street I use as a shortcut to bypass traffic. And not only that, they arrive home at the *same time* I do so we always see each other. 

She ended up emailing me this year and explained how he saw the texts we sent and how he banned her from talking to me. I stopped writing her back but she revealed he *really* wants to kick my ass still. He's even lost a job in the past because he attacked a coworker for making a comment about her. He's just a violent guy really clinging to what he scooped up.

So there have been 3 different times this year I've seen them in the same store I was in. And every single time, I made sure they didn't see me and just left as fast as I could :(

On top of that, he's aware I know where they live because of seeing me drive by. I think this has set off paranoia for him, because I've seen him walk out into the street after I pass by and just stare at my car...expecting me to drive back or something. It's ridiculous but it happens.

So my questions are:

- I shouldn't have to drive elsewhere, right? I feel like it's cowardly to extend my commute by 15 minutes just because I want to avoid driving by a house. I deal with a lot of traffic so I like nothing more than to arrive home as fast as I can. Do I just awkwardly pretend to not see them if they're outside? Do I smile and wave? Do I dog him back??

- What do I do if he approaches me? It's very likely to happen considering there have been close calls before. I'm okay with verbal confrontation - but I don't think he is. Unless the words out of my mouth, ""I'm sorry please don't hurt me"" I don't think there's anything I can say that won't culminate in me being attacked. But I feel if I hit him before he can hit me, it can easily be spun into a thing where he ""just"" wanted to talk and I was the evil person who hit him. 

The only thing I have going for me in this regards is that I absolutely look like an office worker, while he has face tattoos and generally dresses like a cholo. I would think that in an incident a cop would probably believe my words over his.

- How the hell do I fix my ""fight or flight"" response? There are days when I feel tough, but then I think I see his car and suddenly I get a sinking feeling and an urge to just run away. That indicates to me that I'm not going to be able to keep my cool during bad moments. Do I have to get used to them?

I (25m) spent years hooking up and have had dozens of partners. What I previously thought would manifest into an insatiable hole of sexual conquest has actually turned into the opposite.

I have grown to realize that sex is such a small fraction of my happiness. I used to seek out arm candy and now I don't even bother. What I realized matters is in the heart... beauty is in the eye of the beholder. It's mostly on the inside of us, in our brains and hearts. Pussy has grown to possess no value to me whatsoever.

I actually enjoy friendships with women in my life. I'm thankful for the heartaches and the romances that have passed. Trying to objectify women for years has actually done the complete opposite- the more I met and slept with women, the more I realized that it doesn't matter.

Sex is as desirable as eating, sleeping, or shitting. It's great for a few moments and then it ends. It's the life you live before and after that matters. There are many more satisfying things in life, filled with much more substance.

So now I am 25 and see that I am a man I would never thought I'd be. Still kinda horny, but with a different perspective.

However, I can’t stop thinking about what happens on “that day”. As I prepare for bed he had went to bed before me and was sleeping in an odd position. I tapped him and he was fine. But it sort’ve startled me. I want to enjoy the last years of my dear dogs life without always wondering what I’ll find when I come home from the store etc. I want to enjoy his life and be surprised when it happens if that makes any sense. But it’s hard for me bc I want to be there to save him when it happens. I have no logical reason to suggest that he will pass anytime soon other than age. During his health scare which turned out to be nothing more than an ear infection, the vet almost refused to believe he was 14. I overthink everything. How can I enjoy him and his life without torturing myself with unneeded thoughts? How do I let go of the desire to control life?",0
1588,"My beloved brother has a tendency to get frustrated/angry easily. I wouldn't say it's anger issues and it has gotten better with time.

However he's studying a 'pre-semester' (it's to improve grades and if you pass you have a guaranteed spot in the university, usually for engeneering and alike, no idea what it's called in english) so he has to study a lot of math, chemistry and physics. Which makes him frustrated. A lot. If he doesn't understand something we can usually hear him punch the desk and get frustrated.

He does take out frustration at gym and takes care of it, and has gone therapy and is trying to get better. But I feel like I could do/buy something to help. I've asked but he's too proud for help. 

He has wanted a boxing bag but given we live in an apartment and he's probs gonna move out asap it's not very practical to hang one up. 

So my question is, when you get angry/frustrated what can others do to help? Is there anything concrete you did that helped (stressball or so)? Or is this something he needs to do by himself?",0

1595,"I have been fighting anxiety and depression for literally as long as I can remember (I'm in my mid 40s now).  I've seen several therapists in the past few years and am on medication.  I recently left my job/career due to crazy amounts of stress and disfunction (if you are curious about the particulars, I wrote about it on another subreddit... just check my history as I apparently can't link it due to sub rules).  Over the past decade, I've switched jobs 3 times.  I went from a huge multinational company (where I was employed for more than a decade) to a small utility company to a tiny support company finally to another large multinational company.

Now that I am unemployed my stress and anxiety has gone way down, but not my depression.  My SO has been hugely supportive but there seems to be this understanding among the people that I talk with that I ""need to"" get back into my high paying career which has burned me out completely.  So much so that about a month after my separation even the thought of ""trying again"" at yet another career job fills me with dread because the literal nature of my career is to be constantly tossed into a new thing and having to learn new skills/knowledges and having to pass the sink-or-swim bar over and over and over and over again.

I don't need the high paying job for money to survive, I live way below my means.  I've kind of been forced into keeping a career due to health insurance BS where I can't rock the insurance boat because I have a couple of chronic conditions that need support (cancer followups, supplies for my CPAP, medicines).  Unfortunately, I've been putting my extra money in my 401k which means I'm literally screwed if I try to take any of it out.

I feel ""broken"" because the field that I am out of is one that I constantly hear people pushing to get into because of how awesome it is.  I feel ""useless"" because I now have no career and I have always been judged by others on my success in my career (which is another reason why I've stuck with it all these years).

I applied for unemployment but am expecting to be denied as I left my last job and I don't qualify for any ""help"" because everything seems to go off of previous years' taxes.  My plan for now is to try to survive on my savings until June (my state has announced they expect all adults to have gotten the COVID vaccine by then) and then find some retail/service/delivery job to pay the bills.  But this doesn't seem to help me feel less ""useless"" and ""broken.""  I just feel like I ""couldn't cut it"" at a real job.

Any suggestions (that don't involve spending a lot of money)?

Now that it's getting to be nice weather, I plan on doing a few mile walk (run eventually), but I need to wait for the sidewalks here to reappear from under the remainder of the winter's snow.  The gym is out for various reasons (mostly COVID and costs).  I'm trying to rediscover some hobbies but many of them were what led me to my career (don't listen to folks saying you should work doing what you love because eventually you will hate it and have nothing).

Let’s say you’re trying to show a car’s picture to your buddy, and when you open your gallery you show your nudes to him. Would you be embarrassed, or feel awkward, or you just don’t care? (like you’d think of it as “we’re all men who cares if another guy sees my dic*”). 

Or even worse, you wanna show him something, but you play a video of your self wanking? 

Or after your have sex with a girl, or just cuddling, do you call your friend? And even pass the phone to the girl to talk to your buddy? (It’s a new girl every time so not his girlfriend).

It seems that every time I visit him, one way or another he talks about how hard it is to find someone. He has confidence issues stemming from a young age but in reality, no one sees him the way he see's himself, and us as family have been getting him out of that.

1600,"I (40s) inherited my mother (70s) a little over a decade ago when my father passed, and at the time, as a morbidly obese recovering addict, it wasn't a big deal to be living with and taking care of my mother.

Now, as someone in shape who has his life more together, I'm finding the separation from her to be quite difficult.

We're enmeshed in ways I'm having trouble setting boundaries for.  She has very few friends besides me, expects way more of me than I can give most days, and... even during the best of times, she's not exactly a kind/loving mother.  

For what it's worth, she's never had many friends, never had a relationship outside of my father, and never lived with anyone but us and her parents, so she's never, ever been alone, and I don't know if she's even capable of it at this point (she's fine cognitively, but also naive, stubborn, etc)... but I also need my independence and the idea of giving me space is completely foreign to her.

As with everything in life, I doubt I'm alone in this, and figured I'd seek out advice from friends out there.

1607,"A little backstory:

F(26) here, and a few years ago, I accidentally let it get too far with this guy who I was casually dating. And by “let things get too far”, I meant that he was way more into me than I was into him. I think I liked spending time with him as a friend, and did not realize this at the time, but I was not at all sexually attracted to him. Also a little hindsight, I was not emotionally available since I was still getting over someone. I just enjoyed his company and we shared a common interest in vegan food and eating in general. So as we started making out and getting more intimate, THAT was when all of this clicked in my head that I wasn’t into him and was still not over an ex-fling.  As we were literally seconds before doing the deed I told him I wasn’t in the mood because I had realized that I’m not over my ex and we ended up cuddling instead. He seemed to take it really well at the time and didn’t pressure me into going further. After that experience, we hung out one more time a couple weeks later. It was weird and awkward since he told me he had to urge to want to be closer and hold me the whole time but knew that I was only looking for friendship and didn’t. We shortly fell out of touch and stopped talking.

The reason why this question is relevant now is because I just tried reaching out to see how he’s doing since he still follows me on social and watches all my stuff but was left on read. Which makes me wonder if he’s still hurt over that? I feel bad but at the same time I didn’t KNOW I wasn’t into it until I KNEW. 😞 It’s been a couple years now but that experience to this day is still the most awkward (non)sexual encounter I’ve ever had. I thought enough time has passed that maybe he would want to reconnect and be friends? But maybe not? Why would he still follow me and watch all my stuff then? So confused. 

I just wanted some perspective from other males.",0

But this is where it gets tricky, so many therapists and resources are for or are focused on the abuse of women and the resources and the emotional outlets we have as men are drastically limited and frankly just hard to find. 

So while I do my research and try to find myself a good therapist, I was wondering, how do you deal with overcoming past emotional abuse on a day to day basis?

I'm back in a relationship and the sex is great ... but kinda short because I'm in a fucking bad state cardiovascular wise.
