# cvd-reddit-nlp-analysis
This is where Akaash & Swetha do their work for Deep Learning on Cardiovascular Disease-related Reddit posts. We build a classifier to predict whether a CVD-related post originated from the r/askWomen subreddit or the r/askMen subreddit.

You'll find our data under the data folder.

All related notebooks are stored in the notebooks folder.

The results can be found in the final paper and deck!
